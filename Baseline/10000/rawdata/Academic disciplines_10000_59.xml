&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Activated charcoal''', also known as '''activated carbon''', is a medication used to treat [[poison]]ings that occurred [[oral administration|by mouth]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; To be effective it must be used within a short time of the poisoning occurring, typically an hour.&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; It does not work for poisonings by [[cyanide poisoning|cyanide]], [[corrosive agents]], [[iron poisoning|iron]], [[lithium poisoning|lithium]], [[alcohol]]s, or [[malathion]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO Model Formulary 2008|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547659|page=57|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213060118/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be taken by mouth or given by a [[nasogastric tube]].&lt;ref name=Ric2015/&gt; Other uses include inside [[hemoperfusion machines]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
Common side effects include [[vomiting]], black stools, diarrhea, and [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; The more serious side effect, [[pneumonitis]], may result if [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirated into the lungs]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHFS2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Charcoal, Activated|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221011707/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use in [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]] is safe.&lt;ref name=Ric2015/&gt; Activated charcoal works by [[adsorption|adsorbing]] the toxin.&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt;

==Medical uses==
===Poison ingestion===
Activated charcoal is used to treat many types of oral poisonings such as [[phenobarbital]] and [[carbamazepine]].&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt; It is not effective for a number of poisonings including: strong acids or bases, [[iron poisoning|iron]], [[lithium]], [[arsenic]], [[methanol poisoning|methanol]], [[ethanol]] or [[ethylene glycol]].&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web | title = Charcoal, Activated | url = https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html | work = The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | accessdate = 23 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140522002026/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html | archivedate = 22 May 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[randomized controlled trials]] have shown activated charcoal improves outcomes and routine use is not recommended.&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt;  In a study of acute poisonings from agricultural [[pesticide]]s and [[Cascabela thevetia|yellow oleander]] seeds, the administration of activated carbon did not affect survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Eddleston M, Juszczak E, Buckley NA |title=Multiple-dose activated charcoal in acute self-poisoning: a randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|year=2008|volume=371|issue=9612|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60270-6|pages=579–87 | pmid=18280328|pmc=2430417 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal tract-related issues===
[[Charcoal biscuit]]s were sold in England starting in the early 19th century, originally as remedy to [[flatulence]] and stomach trouble.&lt;ref name=Rolland&gt;{{cite book | last= Rolland |first= Jacques L. | title= The Food Encyclopedia: Over 8,000 Ingredients, Tools, Techniques and People | publisher=Robert Rose | year=2006 | isbn= 0-7788-0150-0 | page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|charcocaps}}

[[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablets]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] of activated carbon are used in many countries as an [[over-the-counter drug]] to treat [[diarrhea]], [[indigestion]], and [[flatulence]].&lt;ref name="stearn2007"&gt;
{{cite book |title       = Warts and all: straight talking advice on life's embarrassing problems |last        = Stearn |first       = Margaret |year        = 2007 |publisher   = Murdoch Books |location    = London |isbn        = 978-1-921259-84-5 |page        = 333 |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=aSRmxC47VNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA333 |accessdate  = 2009-05-03 |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910183018/https://books.google.com/books?id=aSRmxC47VNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA333 |archivedate = 2017-09-10 |df          = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence of its effectiveness to prevent diarrhea in cancer patients who have received [[irinotecan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michael M, Brittain M, Nagai J |title=Phase II study of activated charcoal to prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=22 |issue=21 |pages=4410–7 |date=Nov 2004 |pmid=15514383 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.11.125 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interfere with the absorption of some medications, and lead to unreliable readings in medical tests such as the [[stool guaiac test|guaiac]] card test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gogel HK, Tandberg D, Strickland RG |title=Substances that interfere with guaiac card tests: implications for gastric aspirate testing |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=474–80 |date=Sep 1989 |pmid=2787993 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(89)90248-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated carbon is also used for bowel preparation by reducing intestinal gas content before abdominal [[radiography]] to visualize [[bile]] and pancreatic and [[renal stones]]. A type of [[charcoal biscuit]] has also been marketed as a pet care product.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Other===
Claims that activated charcoal will do things such as whiten teeth, cure alcohol-induced [[hangovers]], and prevent bloating, are not supported by evidence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Side effects==
Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in [[pulmonary aspiration]] which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated.&lt;ref name="Chest1989-Elliott"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott C, Colby T, Kelly T, Hicks H | title = Charcoal lung. Bronchiolitis obliterans after aspiration of activated charcoal | journal = Chest | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 672–4 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2766830 | doi = 10.1378/chest.96.3.672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of activated carbon is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] when the ingested substance is an acid, an alkali, or a petroleum product.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Mechanism of action==
In cases of suspected poisoning, medical personnel administer activated carbon on the scene or at a hospital's [[emergency department]]. In rare situations, it may also be used in a [[hemoperfusion]] system to remove toxins from the blood stream of poisoned patients. Activated carbon has become the treatment of choice for many poisonings, and other decontamination methods such as [[syrup of ipecac|ipecac]]-induced [[emesis]] or [[Gastric lavage|stomach pumping]] are now used rarely.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

*Binding of the poison to prevent stomach and intestinal absorption.  Reversible binding using a [[cathartic]], such as [[sorbitol]], may be added.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
*It interrupts the [[enterohepatic circulation|enterohepatic]] and [[enteroenteric circulation]] of some drugs/toxins and their [[metabolites]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="859">In the [[sociology of religion]], [[Luc de Heusch]] coined the term '''adorcism''' for practices to placate or accommodate [[spiritual entities]] in a [[Spirit_possession|possessed]] person or place. Unlike [[exorcism]], the relationship with the entities is potentially positive. This is sometimes used as [[initiation]] into a spirit cult.&lt;ref&gt;Luc de Heusch. Cultes de possession et religions initiatiques de salut en Afrique. Annales du Centre d'etudes des Religions, ii. 226-44. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Oughourlian defines adorcism as "voluntary, desired, and curative possessions".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Oughourlian. The Puppet of Desire: The Psychology of Hysteria, Possession, and Hypnosis [Eugene Webb, trans. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991], p. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''arabesque''' is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised [[half-palmette]]s, which were combined with spiralling stems".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of a single design which can be '[[tessellation|tiled]]' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the very wide range of [[Eurasia]]n decorative art that includes [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s matching this basic definition, the term "arabesque" is used consistently as a technical term by [[history of art|art historians]] to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: [[Islamic art]] from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. [[Interlace (art)|Interlace]] and [[Scroll (art)|scroll]] decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art but they develop what was already a long tradition by the coming of Islam. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art can only be described as confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, but others are closely based on [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the [[decorative arts]], but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is there often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque, and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however these are without support from written historical sources as, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did.  At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of [[geometry]] remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The case for a connection with [[Islamic mathematics]] is much stronger for the development of the [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] with which arabesques are often combined in art.  Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabesque is a French term that derived from the Italian word Arabesco, and it means Arabic style. 

The development of this and related terms in the main European languages is complicated, and described in "Western arabesque" below.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based [[scroll (art)|scroll]] ornament in the cultures taken over by the early [[Islamic conquests]].  Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century [[mosaic]]s of the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]], often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style.  The plants most often used are stylized versions of the [[Acanthus mollis|acanthus]], with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems.  The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the [[Mshatta Facade]]. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 75-88; Canby, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively abundant survivals of [[stucco]] [[relief]]s from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in [[Abbasid Samarra]], the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, Gülru, Payne, Alina, ''Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local'', 88-90, 2016, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0691167281}}, 978069116728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nACCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 google books]; [https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/museums/mik/miksamarra.html "Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin: Objects from Samarra"]; Ettinghausen et al, 57-59; examples of styles A,B, and C illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable  diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa's Chapter 4 gives an overview of these questions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen|Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik]]'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque.  While the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[History of Iran#Mongol invasion .281219.E2.80.931221.29|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or "under" as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending, and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent.  Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in [[wallpaper]] and [[textile]]s.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. "Leaf" forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a "half-[[palmette]]" form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament.  New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called [[honeysuckle]], and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space.  The early [[Mshatta Facade]] is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these.  Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species.  In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called ''saz'' became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves.  Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of [[Chinese porcelain]], replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===

[[File:Alhambra (038).jpg|thumb|upright|Three modes: Arabesques, [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] used together in the [[Court of the Myrtles]], [[Alhambra]].]]

The arabesques and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of Islamic art are often said to arise from the [[Islam]]ic view of the world (see above). The [[Aniconism in Islam|depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged]], which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the [[truss]]). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four [[equilateral]] sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: [[soil|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]] and [[water]]. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of [[plant]] forms. This mode recalls the [[female|feminine]] nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Instead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers [[calligraphy]] a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the [[Qur'an]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both [[art]] and [[science]]. The artwork is at the same time [[mathematical]]ly precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both [[secular]] and [[religious]] artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=19 December 2015 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the [[Mosque]] is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere [[ghost]]ly approximation of the [[spirit]]ual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God's creation has been obscured by the [[sin]]s of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by [[calligraphy]]. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a "vegetal design consisting of full...and half [[palmette]]s [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To the adherents of [[Islam]], the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Western arabesque==
[[File:Tapis de Savonnerie Louis XIV apres Charles Le Brun pour la Grande Galerie du Louvre.jpg|thumb|The French sense of arabesque: [[Savonnerie]] carpet after [[Charles Le Brun]] for the ''Grande Galerie'' of the [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Царское-село,-Екатерининский-дворец.jpg|thumb|What is called the "Arabesque Room" in the [[Catherine Palace]], with [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[grotesque]] decoration.|221x221px]]
The term arabesque was first used in the West in [[Italian language|Italian]], where ''rabeschi'' was used in the 16th century as a term for "[[pilaster]] ornaments featuring [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration",&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"&gt;Osborne, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically "running scrolls" that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 159&lt;/ref&gt;  The book ''Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi'' (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled "Samples of Embroidery"), published in Venice in 1530, includes "groppi moreschi e rabeschi", Moorish knots and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/35.75.3 Met Museum]; the Italian word uses the Latin derived "inceptive" or "inchoative" word ending "-esco" signifying a beginning, thus ''ferveo'', to boil and ''fervesco'' to begin to boil.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it spread to England, where [[Henry VIII]] owned, in an inventory of 1549, an [[agate]] cup with a "fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Arabesque":"1549 Inventory Henry VIII (1998) 25/2 Item one Cuppe of Agathe the fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke";&lt;/ref&gt; and William Herne or Heron, [[Serjeant Painter]] from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I's barge with "rebeske work".&lt;ref&gt;"rebeske" being a now disused version of "arabesque", see OED, "Rebesk". Herne payment quoted in [[Erna Auerbach]], ''Tudor Artists'', 1954; not in print OED&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately the styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by [[Hans Holbein the younger|Hans Holbein]] for a covered cup for [[Jane Seymour]] in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus volutes]].&lt;ref name=marks&gt;Marks, Richard and Williamson, Paul, eds. ''Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547'', 156, 2003, V&amp;A Publications, London, {{ISBN|1-85177-401-7}}.  For other Renaissance ornament from Henry's court, see also no 13 on page 156, and pp. 144-145, 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related term is [[moresque]], meaning "[[Moors|Moorish]]"; [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' of 1611 defines this as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Moresque", citing Cotgrave&lt;/ref&gt; and "arabesque", in its earliest use cited in the [[OED]] (but as a French word), as "Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing".&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"&gt;OED, "Arabesque"&lt;/ref&gt;  In France "arabesque" first appears in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;Larrouse dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and "was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century" to [[grotesque]] ornament, "despite the classical origin of the latter", especially if without human figures in it - a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34 (quoted), see also [[OED]] quoted below and Cotgrave - Osborne says the French usage begins in the "latter part of the 17th century" but in the following paragraphs describes a development beginning rather before this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries the three terms grotesque, moresque and arabesque were used largely interchangeably in English, French and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with "grotesque" gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic [[gargoyle]]s and [[caricature]] than to either [[Pompeii]]-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns.  Meanwhile, the word "arabesque" was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when [[John Ruskin]] uses it in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, para 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fuhring notes that grotesques were "confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France", but in his terminology "the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches...", categories he goes on to discuss individually.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: [[bookbinding]]s decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the "characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars".&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"/&gt; Apparently starting in [[embroidery]], it then appears in garden design before being used in [[Northern Mannerist]] painted decorative schemes "with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms" by [[Simon Vouet]] and then [[Charles Lebrun]] who used "scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and [[palmette]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; More exuberant arabesque designs by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] are an early "intimation" of the [[Rococo]], which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "arabesque" as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' in 1786.&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"/&gt;
Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: "Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Art Online]], "Arabesque", accessed March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of [[Raphael]], founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque."&lt;ref&gt;OED, printed and online editions (accessed March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. [[Robert Granjon]], a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Decorative ornaments and alphabets of the Renaissance : 1,020 copyright-free motifs from printed sources|date=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486266053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was rapidly used by many other printers.&lt;ref name="Hoefler Text: Arabesques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoefler Text: Arabesques|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English printers' ornaments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomer|first1=Henry R.|title=English printers' ornaments|date=1924|publisher=Martino Pub.|location=Mansfield Center, CT|isbn=9781578987153|url=https://archive.org/details/englishprinterso00plom|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historic Design in Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Historic Design in Printing|date=1923|publisher=Graphic Arts Company|location=Boston, MA|url=https://archive.org/details/historicdesignin00john|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]] and [[Firmin Didot|Didot]], the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], Many fine books from the period 1890-1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers.&lt;ref name="The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Beverly K.|title=The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston|date=2009|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558496774|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many digital [[serif font]]s include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.&lt;ref name="Moresque 2D"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moresque 2D |url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/ |website=MyFonts |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is designed to treat polluted [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from an adjacent parking lot. Plants are in winter dormancy.]]

'''Bioretention''' is the process in which contaminants and [[sedimentation]] are removed from [[stormwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Stormwater is collected into the treatment area which consists of a grass buffer strip, sand bed, ponding area, [[organic matter|organic]] layer or [[mulch]] layer, planting [[soil]], and plants. Runoff passes first over or through a sand bed, which slows the runoff's velocity, distributes it evenly along the length of the ponding area, which consists of a surface [[organic matter|organic]] layer and/or [[groundcover]] and the underlying planting soil. The ponding area is graded, its center depressed. Water is ponded to a depth of {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and gradually infiltrates the bioretention area or is [[Evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]]. The bioretention area is graded to divert excess runoff away from itself. Stored water in the bioretention area planting soil exfiltrates over a period of days into the underlying soils.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Bioretention |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=200044BE.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-832-F-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filtration==
Each of the components of the bioretention area is designed to perform a specific function. The grass buffer strip reduces incoming runoff velocity and filters [[particulate]]s from the runoff. The sand bed also reduces the velocity, filters particulates, and spreads flow over the length of the bioretention area. [[Aeration]] and drainage of the planting soil are provided by the {{convert|0.5|m|in|abbr=on}} deep sand bed. The ponding area provides a temporary storage location for runoff prior to its [[evaporation]] or [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Some particulates not filtered out by the grass filter strip or the sand bed settle within the ponding area.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact" /&gt;

The [[organic matter|organic]] or [[mulch]] layer also filters [[Water pollution|pollutants]] and provides an environment conducive to the growth of [[microorganism]]s, which degrade [[petroleum]]-based products and other [[organic matter|organic]] material. This layer acts in a similar way to the [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] in a forest and prevents the [[erosion]] and drying of underlying soils. Planted [[groundcover]] reduces the potential for erosion as well, slightly more effectively than mulch. The maximum sheet flow velocity prior to erosive conditions is 0.3 meters per second (1 foot per second) for planted groundcover and 0.9 meters per second (3 feet per second) for mulch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar |first1=M.L. |last2=Barfield |first2=B.J. |last3=O’Connor |first3=T.P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Practice Design Guide, Volume 2: Vegetative Biofilters |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901X0B00.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |id=EPA-600/R-04/121A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[clay]] in the planting soil provides [[adsorption]] sites for [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[nutrient]]s and other pollutants. Stormwater storage is also provided by the voids in the planting soil. The stored water and nutrients in the water and soil are then available to the plants for uptake. The layout of the bioretention area is determined after site constraints such as location of utilities, underlying soils, existing vegetation, and drainage are considered. Sites with [[loam]]y sand soils are especially appropriate for bioretention because the excavated soil can be backfilled and used as the planting soil, thus eliminating the cost of importing planting soil. An unstable surrounding soil stratum and soils with a clay content greater than 25 percent may preclude the use of bioretention, as would a site with slopes greater than 20 percent or a site with mature trees that would be removed during construction of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Bioretention Manual |url=http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108182559/http://www.co.pg.md.us/Government/AgencyIndex/DER/ESG/Bioretention/pdf/Bioretention%20Manual_2009%20Version.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-08 |publisher=Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources |location=Largo, MD |pages=6, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy metal remediation==
Contaminant trace metals such as [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] are found in [[stormwater runoff]] from impervious surfaces (e.g. roadways and sidewalks). Treatment systems such as rain gardens and stormwater planters utilize a bioretention layer to remove heavy metals in stormwater runoff. Dissolved forms of heavy metals may bind to sediment particles in the roadway that are then captured by the bioretention system. Additionally, heavy metals may adsorb to soil particles in the bioretention media as the runoff filters through.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2008). {{doi|10.1021/es702681j}} "Heavy metal capture and accumulation in bioretention media." Environmental science &amp; technology, 42(14), 5247-5253.&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory experiments, bioretention cells removed 94%, 88%, 95%, and &gt;95% of zinc, copper, lead, and [[cadmium]], respectively from water with metal concentrations typical of stormwater runoff. While this is a great benefit for water quality improvement, bioretention systems have a finite capacity for heavy metal removal. This will ultimately control the lifetime of bioretention systems, especially in areas with high heavy metal loads.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., &amp; Davis, A. P. (2007).[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0045653506010927/1-s2.0-S0045653506010927-main.pdf?_tid=325fb1ca-8149-11e4-9703-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1418311390_040bf304a2459b6fcaaeff49731195a6 "Heavy metal fates in laboratory bioretention systems."] Chemosphere, 66(9), 1601-1609.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Metal removal by bioretention cells in cold climates was similar or slightly lower than that in warmer environments. Plants are less active in colder seasons, suggesting that most of the heavy metals remain in the bioretention media rather than being taken up by plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;Muthanna, T. M., Viklander, M., Gjesdahl, N., &amp; Thorolfsson, S. T. (2007).[http://search.proquest.com/docview/746872016/ "Heavy metal removal in cold climate bioretention."] Water, air, and soil pollution, 183(1-4), 391-402.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, removal and replacement of the bioretention layer will become necessary in areas with heavy metal pollutants in stormwater runoff to extend the life of the treatment system.

[[File:FortEdwardWindsorNovaScotiaCanada.JPG|thumb|Completed in 1750, [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] is the oldest remaining military blockhouse in [[North America]].]]
[[File:Donjon chateau a motte saint sylvain.jpg|thumb|upright|Reconstructed [[Europe]]an wooden [[keep]] at [[Saint-Sylvain-d'Anjou]], [[France]], has a strong resemblance to a [[North America]]n western frontier log blockhouse]]

In [[military science]], a '''blockhouse''' is a small [[fortification]], usually consisting of one or more rooms with [[Arrowslit|loopholes]], allowing its defenders to fire in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|authorlink1=Stephen C. Spiteri|title=Illustrated Glossary of Terms used in Military Architecture|journal=ARX Supplement|page=637|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/illustrated-glossary-of-military-architecture-terms.html|date=2010|publisher=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=2 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603174909/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/illustrated-glossary-of-military-architecture-terms.html#|archive-date=3 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually refers to an isolated fort in the form of a single building, serving as a defensive strong point against any enemy that does not possess [[Siege engine|siege equipment]] or, in modern times, [[artillery]], [[air force]] and [[cruise missile]]s. A fortification intended to resist these weapons is more likely to qualify as a [[Fortification|fortress]] or a [[redoubt]], or in modern times, be an underground [[bunker]]. However, a blockhouse may also refer to a room within a larger fortification, usually a [[artillery battery|battery]] or redoubt.

==Etymology==
The term "[[wikt:blockhouse|blockhouse]]" is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to [[Middle Dutch]] ''[[:nl:wikt:blokhus|blokhus]]'' and 18th-century French ''[[:fr:blocus|blocus]]'' (blockade).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=blockhouse (n.), blockade (n.)|work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockhouses in ancient Greece ==
Blockhouses existed in ancient Greece, for example the one near [[Mycenae]] [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/146534.pdf]

== Early blockhouses in England ==
[[File:Mount Edgcumbe blockhouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Henry VIII of England|Henrican]] blockhouse at [[Mount Edgcumbe Country Park|Mount Edgcumbe]] near Plymouth, Devon, which is believed to date from ''circa'' 1545]]

Early blockhouses were designed solely to protect a particular area by the use of artillery, and they had accommodation only for the short-term use of the garrison. The first known example is the [[Cow Tower, Norwich]], built in 1398, which was of brick and had three storeys with the upper storeys pierced for six guns each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block1.htm|title=Definition of a Blockhouse|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605230950/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block1.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major period of construction was in the [[Device Forts|maritime defence programmes]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] between 1539 and 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block2.htm|title=Blockhouse dates|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231011/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block2.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built to protect important maritime approaches such as the [[Thames Estuary]], the [[Solent]], and [[Plymouth]]. Often sited in pairs, the blockhouses were not built to a common design, but usually consisted of a stone tower and [[bastion]] or gun platform, which could be semi-circular, rectangular or irregular in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block3.htm|title=Blockhouse general description|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231017/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block3.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last blockhouse of this type was [[Cromwell's Castle]], built in [[Scilly]] in 1651.

== Coastal fortifications in Malta ==
[[File:Tunnara museum.jpeg|thumb|Blockhouse of [[Westreme Battery]], built in 1715–16 in [[Mellieħa]], [[Malta]]]]

Blockhouses were an ubiquitous feature in [[Malta]]'s coastal fortifications built in the 18th century by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. Between 1714 and 1716, dozens of [[artillery batteries|batteries]] and [[redoubt]]s were built around the coasts of the Maltese Islands, while a few others were built in the subsequent decades. Almost every battery and redoubt had a blockhouse, which served as gun crew accommodation and a place to store munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiteri |first1=Stephen C. |authorlink1=Stephen C. Spiteri |title=ARX – Hospitaller Coastal Batteries |url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html |website=MilitaryArchitecture.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hCdpHdya?url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/arx-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html |archivedate=2 May 2016 |date=12 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the batteries consisted of a semi-circular or polygonal gun platform, with one or two blockhouses at the rear. The blockhouses usually had musketry loopholes, and in some cases were linked together by [[redan]]s. Surviving batteries include [[Mistra Battery]] and [[Ferretti Battery]], which both have two blockhouses, and [[Saint Mary's Battery]] and [[Saint Anthony's Battery]], which have a single blockhouse.

Many of the redoubts consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse at the rear, although a few had semi-circular or rectangular platforms. Surviving redoubts with blockhouses include [[Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq Redoubt]] and [[Briconet Redoubt]], both of which have a pentagonal plan. A few of the redoubts consisted of a single tower-like blockhouse without a platform, and were known as ''tour-reduits''. Of the four ''tour-reduits'' that were built, only the [[Vendôme Tower]] survives today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiteri |first1=Stephen C. |authorlink1=Stephen C.

== Age of exploration ==
Originally blockhouses were often constructed as part of a large plan, to "block" access to vital points in the scheme. But from the [[Age of Exploration]] to the nineteenth century standard patterns of blockhouses were constructed for defence in frontier areas, particularly [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Richard|title=Blockhouses in Canada, 1749–1841: a Comparative Report and Catalogue|series= Occasional Papers in Archaeology and History, Canadian Historic Site|isbn=978-0-660-10298-6|year= 1980}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=W. Jerome D.|last2=Spence|first2=David L.|title=A History of Hickman County, Tennessee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIE7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271|year=1900|publisher=Southern Historical Press|isbn=978-0-89308-242-0|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockhouses may be made of [[masonry]] where available, but were commonly made from very heavy [[timber]]s, sometimes even [[Wooden log|logs]] arranged in the manner of a [[log cabin]]. They were usually two or even three [[Storey|floors]], with all storeys being provided with [[embrasure]]s or loopholes, and the uppermost storey would be roofed. If the structure was of timber, usually the upper storey would project outward from the lower so the upper storey defenders could fire on enemies attacking the lower storey, or perhaps pour water on any fires. When the structure had only one storey, its loopholes were often placed close to the ceiling, with a bench lining the walls inside for defenders to stand on, so that attackers could not easily reach the loopholes.

[[File:FortYork-Blockhouse.jpg|thumb|A 19th-century-era block house in [[Fort York]], Toronto]]

Blockhouses were normally entered via a sturdy, barred door at ground level. Most blockhouses were roughly square in [[plan]], but some of the more elaborate ones were [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al, to provide better all-around fire. In some cases, blockhouses became the basis for complete forts, by building a [[palisade]] with the blockhouse at one corner, and possibly a second tower at the opposite corner. Many historical stone blockhouses have survived, and a few timber ones have been restored at historical sites. In New Zealand, the [[Cameron Blockhouse]], near [[Whanganui]], is one of the few blockhouses to survive from the [[New Zealand land wars]].

== Second Boer War ==
{{See also|Second Boer War#British response|l1=British response to Guerrilla warfare during the Second Boer War}}
[[File:Burgersdorp-Sentinel-001.JPG|thumb|Sentinel Blockhouse in [[Burgersdorp]]]]

During the [[Second Boer War]] the British forces built a large number of fortifications in [[South Africa]]. Around 441 were solid masonry blockhouses,&lt;ref name="SAMHJ01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomlinson|first=Richard|title=Britain's Last Castles – Masonry Blockhouses of the South African War, 1899–1902|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=The South African Military History Society|volume=10|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol106rt.html|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the construction of these blockhouses, but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone.

However the vast scale of British strategy led the British to develop cheaper, double-skinned corrugated iron structures.&lt;ref name="Blockhouses of the Boer War"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blockhouses of the Boer War |first=Mike |last=Hanslow |url=http://www.bwm.org.au/site/Blockhouses.php#iron|accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could be prefabricated, delivered to site by armoured train, and then have locally sourced rocks or rubble packed inside the double skin to provide improved protection.

A circular design developed by Major Rice in February 1901 had good all round visibility, and the lack of corners did away with the need for a substructure. Failure due to wood rot and splintering when hit by bullets or shrapnel were eliminated. The steel door to the blockhouse was sheltered by another piece of corrugated iron. The Major Rice blockhouse could be erected in six hours by six trained men. With the change from square gabled roofs to a circular design, they were given the nickname "Pepperpot blockhouse".&lt;ref name="Blockhouses of the Boer War" /&gt; With mass production the cost to build a blockhouse dropped down to £16, compared to several hundred pounds for masonry ones.

These blockhouses played a vital role in the protection of the railway lines and bridges that were key to the British military supply lines.&lt;ref name="SAMHJ01" /&gt;

== Concrete blockhouses ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gulf War]] --&gt;
During [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many types of blockhouses were built, when time allowed usually constructed of [[reinforced concrete]]. The major difference between a modern blockhouse and a [[bunker]] is that a bunker is constructed mostly below ground level while a blockhouse is constructed mostly above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;For the difference between blockhouses and bunkers see {{harvnb|Schneider|Kitchen|2002|p=87}}, {{harvnb|BACM Research|2009|p=209}}, {{harvnb|Davis|2007|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admiralty Citadel2008.jpg|thumb|The Admiralty Citadel in 2008]]

Some blockhouses like those constructed in England in 1940 were built [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|in anticipation of a German invasion]], they were often hexagonal in shape and were called "[[pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es". About 28,000 [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications]] were constructed of which about 6,500 still survive.&lt;ref name = dob_review &gt;{{cite web | title=A Review Of The Defence of Britain Project | work=Report | url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/projects/dob/review/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hochbunker Leitturm Augarten.jpg|thumb|upright|A German-built [[Flak tower|Flakturm]] (anti-aircraft tower) in the [[Augarten]] Vienna, Austria]]

In London the [[Military citadels under London#Admiralty Citadel|Admiralty Citadel]] is one of the most sturdy above ground structures built during World War II. It was constructed in 1940–1941 as a bomb-proof operations centre for the [[Admiralty]], with foundations nine metres deep and a concrete roof six metres thick. It too was intended to serve as a strongpoint in defending against the feared invasion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In Berlin and other cities during [[World War II]] some massive blockhouses were built as air-raid shelters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] platforms. They were called ''[[Hochbunker]]'' (literally, "high bunkers"; better translated as "above ground bunkers", to distinguish them from the usual deep i.e. underground air raid shelters) and those that functioned as anti-aircraft artillery platforms were also called [[Flak tower]]s. Some were over six stories high; several survive to this day because of the high cost of demolition. The {{Interlanguage link multi|Hochbunker Pallasstraße|de}} in Berlin-[[Schöneberg]] has a post-war block of flats built over it. During the [[Cold War]] the shelter was in use as a NATO foodstore.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the [[Guerrilla phase of the Irish Civil War]] (1922–1923), a network of blockhouses was constructed to protect the railways from guerrilla attacks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Bonapartism''' is the political ideology of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his followers and successors. It was later used to refer to people who hoped to restore the [[House of Bonaparte]] and its style of government. After Napoleon, the term was applied to the French politicians who seized power in the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], ruling in the [[French Consulate]] and subsequently in the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire|Second]] French Empires under the [[House of Bonaparte]] (the family of Bonaparte and his nephew [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon]]). The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or [[authoritarian]] [[centralized government|centralized state]], with a [[strongman (political)|strongman]] charismatic leader based on [[populism|anti-elitist]] rhetoric, army support, and conservatism.

[[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], and was a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used "Bonapartism" to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

According to his essay "[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]" (1852), Marx believed that both Napoleon and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] had corrupted revolutions in [[France]] in this way. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history by saying: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

More generally, "Bonapartism" may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Many &lt;!--who, specifically, with cite to RS --&gt;modern-day [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other leftists use the phrase "left Bonapartist" to describe those, such as [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], who controlled 20th-century bureaucratic socialist regimes. In addition, [[Leon Trotsky]] was accused of using his position as commander of the [[Red Army]] to gain top-level power after [[Lenin]]'s death.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh's book ''The Legend of Napoleon'' explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a 
"popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the 'nation' and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon's ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of [[false consciousness]]: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends. 

==Ideology==

Philosophically, Bonapartism was Napoleon's adaptation of principles of the [[French Revolution]] to suit his imperial form of rule. Desires for public order, French national glory, and emulation of the [[Roman Empire]] had combined to create a [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] ''coup d'etat'' for General Bonaparte on [[18 Brumaire]]. Though he espoused adherence to revolutionary precedents, he "styled his direct and personal rule on the Old Regime monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Truesdell |first=Matthew |title=Spectacular Politics: Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and the Fête impériale, 1849-1870 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510689-3|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f1SwirhmHMC&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonapartists, the most significant lesson of the Revolution was that unity of government and the governed was paramount. 

The [[Bee (mythology)|honey bee]] was a prominent political emblem for both the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/essential_napoleon/symbols/index.asp#abeilles |title=History of the Two Empires: The Symbols of Empire |author= |year=2008 |publisher=Fondation Napoléon |accessdate=17 September 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the Bonapartist ideal of devoted service, self-sacrifice and social loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Englund |first=Steven  |title=Napoleon: A Political Life |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-01803-7 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ZJbxGwU4cC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristics of political Bonapartism were flexibility and adaptability. [[Napoleon III]] once commented on the diversity of opinions in his cabinet, united under the banner of Bonapartism. Referring to the leading figures in the government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], he remarked: "The [[Empress Eugenie|Empress]] is a [[Legitimist]], [[Duc de Morny|Morny]] is an [[Orléanist]], [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] is a [[republicanism|Republican]], and I myself am a [[Socialist]]. There is only one Bonapartist, [[Persigny]]&amp;nbsp;–  and he is mad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Common Violet.JPG|thumb|During his exile to Elba (1814–1815), Napoleon Bonaparte announced he would return in the spring. The violet became a symbol of this and of Bonapartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Suzanne G.|title=Funerary Arts and Tomb Cult: Living with the Dead in France, 1750-1870|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2261-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pONxfBACLPUC&amp;pg=PA172 172] (footnote 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[France|French]] [[politics|political]] history, ''[[Bonapartiste]]s'' were [[monarchist]]s who desired a French Empire under the House of Bonaparte, the [[Corsica]]n family of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis-Napoleon ([[Napoleon III of France]]).

Bonapartism developed after Napoleon I was exiled to [[Elba]]. The Bonapartists helped him regain his power, leading to the [[Hundred Days]] period. Some of his acolytes could not accept his defeat in 1815 at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] or the [[Congress of Vienna]], and continued to promote the Bonaparte ideology. After Napoleon I's death in exile on [[Saint Helena]] in 1821, many of these people transferred their allegiance to other members of his family. After the death of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt (known to Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II]]), Bonapartist hopes rested on several different members of the family.&lt;ref name=Riff1990&gt;{{Cite book|last=Riff |first=Michael A.|title=Dictionary of Modern Political Ideologies |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-3289-9|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbances of 1848 gave hope to the nascent political undercurrent. Bonapartism, as an ideology of politically neutral French peasants and workers (EJ Hobsbawm), was essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and gave him the political support necessary for his 1852 discarding of the constitution and proclaiming the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title [[Napoleon III]] to acknowledge the brief reign of Napoleon's son Napoleon II at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815 (see the [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|abdication of Napoleon I]] in 1815).

In 1870, the [[French National Assembly]] forced Napoleon III to sign a declaration of war against Prussia; France suffered a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The emperor surrendered to the Prussians and their German allies to avoid further bloodshed at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]]. He went into exile after a parliamentary coup created the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Acton|first=Lord |authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton |title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=18 September 2011|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan Co. |location=New York |page=495ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonapartists continued to agitate for another member of the family to be placed on the throne. From 1871 forward, they competed with [[Monarchist]] groups that favoured the restoration of the family of [[Louis-Philippe]], [[King of the French]] (1830–1848) (the [[Orléanist]]s), and also with those who favoured the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]], the traditional French [[royal family]] ([[Legitimist]]s). The strength of these three factions combined was powerful, but they did not unite on the choice of the new French monarch. Monarchist fervor eventually waned, and the French Republic became more or less a permanent facet of French life. Bonapartism was slowly relegated to being the civic faith of a few romantics as more of a hobby than a practical political philosophy. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when [[Eugène Bonaparte]], the only son of Napoleon III, was [[Anglo-Zulu War|killed in action]] while serving as a [[British Army]] officer in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in 1879. Thereafter Bonapartism ceased to be a significant political force.

The current head of the Bonaparte family is the Prince Napoleon, great-great-great-grandson of Napoleon I's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon|Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] (born 1986). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There is no serious political movement that aims to restore any of these men to the imperial throne of France.

==Bonapartist claimants==
[[File:Pierson - Jérôme Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|Jérôme Bonaparte, founder of the legitimate line]]

After becoming Emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon's own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], with whom he had one son. 

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jerome, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognized this child as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the Bonaparte Empire was restored to power in France in 1852, the Emperor was Napoleon III, [[Louis Bonaparte]]'s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]], who was recognized by Bonapartists as "Napoleon IV" before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III's line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jerome, Napoleon's youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. (Excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved.) The Bonapartist claimants since 1879, have been the descendants of Jerome and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored [[primogeniture]] (by excluding [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==

Based on the career of [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] defined Bonapartism as a political expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/], Marxists website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], as well as a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used the term ''[[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartism]]'' to refer to a situation in which [[counterrevolutionary]] military officers seize power from [[revolutionaries]], and use selective [[reformism]] to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower [[ruling class]]. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way.  Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surveys in Exile |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |editor=David Fernbach |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |isbn=978-0-14-021603-5 |page=146 |quote=Hegel remarks somewhere that all great events and characters of world history occur, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that a Bonapartist regime could exert great power, because there was no class with enough confidence or power to firmly establish its authority in its own name. A leader who appeared to stand above the class struggle could take the mantle of power. He believed that this was an inherently unstable situation, as the apparently all-powerful leader would be swept aside when the class struggle in society was resolved. 

[[Leon Trotsky]] described [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime as Bonapartist, as he believed it was balanced between the [[proletariat]], victorious but shattered by war, and the [[bourgeoisie#The Marxist view|bourgeoisie]], broken by the revolution but struggling to re-emerge.  The failure of Stalin's regime to disintegrate under the shock and disruption of the losses of the Second World War, and the success of its expansion into Eastern Europe, challenged this analysis. Many [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] rejected the idea that Stalin's regime was Bonapartist. [[Tony Cliff]] described such regimes as [[State capitalism#Use by Trotskyists|state capitalist]] in type and not as deformed [[socialist state|workers' states]] at all. In the last year of his life, Trotsky argued the example of Napoleon's expanding empire. He had achieved the abolition of serfdom in Poland and other French holdings, but his empire was still "Bonapartist."

"Bonapartism" may be used generally to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Some modern-day Trotskyists and others on the left use the phrase ''left Bonapartist'' to describe leaders such as Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], who controlled left-wing or populist totalitarian regimes. Bonapartism was an example of the Marxist idea of false consciousness: the masses could be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartism in the French political spectrum==

According to historian [[René Rémond]]'s famous 1954 book, ''Les Droites en France'', Bonapartism constitutes one of the three French [[right-wing]] families; the latest one after [[far-right]] [[Legitimism]] and [[center-right]] [[Orleanism]]. Both [[Boulangisme]] and [[Gaullism]] would be forms of Bonapartism.

However, Bonapartists have consistently disagreed with this classification, as one of the fundamentals of Bonapartism as an ideology is the refusal to adhere to the left-right divide, which they see as an obstacle to the welfare and unity of the nation. Martin S Alexander, in his book "French History since Napoleon" (London, Arnold, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999) notes that Bonapartism as an idea would not have made a significant impact if it had been classifiable as either left-wing or right-wing. The historian Jean Sagnes in "The roots of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's Socialism" notes that the future Emperor of the French edited his political works through far-left publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Sagnes |title= Les racines du socialisme de Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte |location= Toulouse |publisher= Privat |date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bonapartist philosophy would fit into the space occupied by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Mouvement Démocrate]], the [[European Social Liberal Party|Nouveau Centre]] and the left wing of the conservative [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]], as these parties occupy the ideological space between parties advocating class struggle and race-based politics, both of which are anathema to Bonapartists, as contrary to the ideal of national unity and religious and ethnic tolerance. This is demonstrated by Napoleonic policy towards industrial disputes, one expression of which&amp;nbsp;– as Frank McLynn writes&amp;nbsp;–  is that strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I but in exchange the police sometimes prevented wages from being lowered,{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=482}} while another is the [[Napoleon and the Jews|assimilation and protection of the Jews.]]

The Marxist theory of "Left" and "Right" Bonapartism can be considered an illustration of what McLynn refers to as Napoleon I's appeal in equal measure "to both the Right and the Left",{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=667}} and what Vincent Cronin describes as "middle of the way", or "moderate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin |date=1994 |title=Napoleon |publisher=HarperCollins |chapter=Chapter 19 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III situated Bonapartism (or the "Napoleonic Idea") between the radicals and conservatives (respectively the Left and the Right) in "Des Idées Napoléoniennes", published in 1839. He expounded on this point to explain that Bonapartism, as practiced by his uncle Napoleon the Great (and represented by himself) was in the middle of "two hostile parties, one of which looks only to the past, and the other only to the future" and combined "the old forms" of the one and the "new principles" of the other.

==Modern Bonapartism==
{{further|Neo-Bonapartism}}

In contemporary times, the term "Bonapartism" has been used in a general sense to describe autocratic, highly centralized regimes dominated by the military.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Craig J. |authorlink=Craig Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-512371-5 |page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA47 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, an official ''Mouvement Bonapartiste'' exists, based in France, headed by Paul-Napoléon Pierre Calland with an unknown number of members around the world. Its official mission statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]o defend, make known and to spread the principles and values of Bonapartism. [The movement] is based on popular support for a policy of recovery combining the efforts of individuals, associations and State services. The movement defends the Bonapartist principles on which it is founded, and which govern its internal organisation. It also defends the memory of Napoleon the Great, as well as those of Napoleon III and their sons, Napoleon II and Napoleon IV. It recognises Napoleon IV as having reigned without governing, by virtue of the plebiscite of May 1870. The movement recognises no emperor after 1879, because of the absence of a plebiscite. Republican, it gives priority to the happiness, interest and glory of peoples, and envisages the restoration of the Empire only if the foundations of the regime are republican and approved by referendum."&lt;ref name=mouvementbonapartiste&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mouvementbonapartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bonapartist-movement |title=Bonapartist Movement |year=2011 |publisher=Mouvement Bonapartiste |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''CAPTCHA''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|p|.|tʃ|ə}}, an [[acronym]] for "'''C'''ompletely '''A'''utomated '''P'''ublic [[Turing test|'''T'''uring test]] to tell '''C'''omputers and '''H'''umans '''A'''part") is a type of [[challenge–response authentication|challenge–response]] test used in [[computing]] to determine whether or not the user is human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/partners/success-stories/recaptcha.html|title=The reCAPTCHA Project – Carnegie Mellon University CyLab|website=www.cylab.cmu.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 2003 by [[Luis von Ahn]], [[Manuel Blum]], Nicholas J. Hopper, and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]].&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; The most common type of CAPTCHA (displayed as Version 1.0) was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel. The first group consisted of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martin Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder|Andrei Z. Broder]]; the second group consisted of Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This form of CAPTCHA requires that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a human, a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a [[reverse Turing test]].

This user identification procedure has received many criticisms, especially from disabled people, but also from other people who feel that their everyday work is slowed down by distorted words that are difficult to read. It takes the average person approximately 10 seconds to solve a typical CAPTCHA.&lt;ref&gt;Bursztein, E., Bethard, S., Fabry, C., Mitchell, J. C., &amp; Jurafsky, D. (n.d.).

== History ==
Since the early days of the [[Internet]], users have wanted to make text illegible to computers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first such people could be [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]], posting about sensitive topics to [[Internet forum]]s they thought were being automatically monitored for keywords. To circumvent such filters, they would replace a word with look-alike characters. ''HELLO'' could become {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;{{!}}-{{!}}3{{!}}_{{!}}_()&lt;/code&gt;}} or {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;)-(3££0&lt;/code&gt;}}, as well as numerous other variants, such that a filter could not possibly detect ''all'' of them. This later became known as [[leet]]speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = h2g2 – An Explanation of l33t Speak – Edited Entry|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest commercial uses of CAPTCHAs was in the '''Gausebeck-Levchin test'''&lt;!-- per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] since the redirect points to this article --&gt;. In 2000, idrive.com began to protect its signup page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrUE1SSXp5Zjl2MW8|title=idrive turing signup page|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a CAPTCHA and prepared to file a patent&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrOS1mWEhITGJ4d2s|title=idrive turing patent application|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this seemingly novel technique. In 2001, [[PayPal]] used such tests as part of a fraud prevention strategy in which they asked humans to "retype distorted text that programs have difficulty recognizing."&lt;ref name=stringham2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Stringham|first1=Edward P |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/private-governance-creating-order-in-economic-and-social-life/oclc/5881934034&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Private Governance : creating order in economic and social life |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |page=105 |isbn=978-0-19-936516-6 |accessdate=2017-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PayPal cofounder and CTO [[Max Levchin]] helped commercialize this early use.

In response, competitors have emerged with alternative models including compensation for the website host or end-user for their effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hCaptcha|url=https://hcaptcha.com|website=hCaptcha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inventorship claims ===

Two teams of people have claimed to be the first to invent the CAPTCHAs used widely on the Web today. The first team consists of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martín Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder]], who used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at [[AltaVista]] to prevent [[Internet bot|bots]] from adding [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] to their [[web search engine]]. Looking for a way to make their images resistant to [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] attack, the team looked at the manual of their [[Brother Industries|Brother]] [[Image scanner|scanner]], which had recommendations for improving OCR's results (similar typefaces, plain backgrounds, etc.). The team created puzzles by attempting to simulate what the manual claimed would cause bad OCR.

The second team to claim inventorship of CAPTCHAs consists of [[Luis von Ahn]], Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford, who first described CAPTCHAs in a 2003 publication&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; and subsequently received much coverage in the popular press. Their notion of CAPTCHA covers any program that can distinguish humans from computers, including many different examples of CAPTCHAs.

The controversy of inventorship has been resolved by the existence of a 1997 priority date patent application by Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-03-01|title=Method and system for discriminating a human action from a computerized action|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050114705A1/en?q=discriminating&amp;q=human&amp;inventor=raanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at [[Sanctum (company)|Sanctum]] on [[Web application firewall|Application Security Firewall]]. Their patent application details that "The invention is based on applying human advantage in applying sensory and cognitive skills to solving simple problems that prove to be extremely hard for computer software. Such skills include, but are not limited to processing of sensory information such as identification of objects and letters within a noisy graphical environment"; and a 1998 patent by Lillibridge, Abadi, Bharat, and Broder.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 6,195,698. Method for selectively restricting access to computer systems. Filed on Apr 13, 1998 and granted on Feb 27, 2001. Available at http://www.google.com/patents/US6195698&lt;/ref&gt; Both patents predate other publications by several years, though they do not use the term CAPTCHA, they describe the ideas in detail and precisely depict the graphical CAPTCHAs used in the Web today.

== Characteristics ==
CAPTCHAs are, by definition, fully automated, requiring little human maintenance or intervention to administer, producing benefits in cost and reliability.

The algorithm used to create the CAPTCHA must be made public, though it may be covered by a patent. This is done to demonstrate that breaking it requires the solution to a difficult problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) rather than just the discovery of the (secret) algorithm, which could be obtained through [[reverse engineering]] or other means.

Modern text-based CAPTCHAs are designed such that they require the simultaneous use of three separate abilities—invariant recognition, segmentation, and parsing—to correctly complete the task with any consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chellapilla|first=Kumar|first2=Kevin|last2=Larson|first3=Patrice|last3=Simard|first4=Mary|last4=Czerwinski|title=Designing Human Friendly Human Interaction Proofs (HIPs)|journal=Microsoft Research|url=https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410195118/http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Invariant recognition refers to the ability to recognize the large amount of variation in the shapes of letters. There are nearly an infinite number of versions for each character that a human brain can successfully identify. The same is not true for a computer, and teaching it to recognize all those differing formations is an extremely challenging task.
# Segmentation, or the ability to separate one letter from another, is also made difficult in CAPTCHAs, as characters are crowded together with no white space in between.
# Context is also critical. The CAPTCHA must be understood holistically to correctly identify each character. For example, in one segment of a CAPTCHA, a letter might look like an "m". Only when the whole word is taken into context does it become clear that it is a "u" and an "n".

Each of these problems poses a significant challenge for a computer, even in isolation. The presence of all three at the same time is what makes CAPTCHAs difficult to solve.&lt;ref name=bursz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Matthieu|last2=Martin|first3=John C.|last3=Mitchell |title= Text-based CAPTCHA Strengths and Weaknesses |journal=ACM Computer and Communication Security 2011 (ACM Conference CSS'2011)|year=2011 |series=Stanford University |url=https://www.elie.net/publication/text-based-captcha-strengths-and-weaknesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike computers, humans excel at this type of task. While segmentation and recognition are two separate processes necessary for understanding an image for a computer, they are part of the same process for a person. For example, when an individual understands that the first letter of a CAPTCHA is an "a", that individual also understands where the contours of that "a" are, and also where it melds with the contours of the next letter. Additionally, the human brain is capable of dynamic thinking based upon context. It is able to keep multiple explanations alive and then pick the one that is the best explanation for the whole input based upon contextual clues. This also means it will not be fooled by variations in letters.

== Relation to AI ==
While used mostly for security reasons, CAPTCHAs also serve as a benchmark task for artificial intelligence technologies. According to an article by Ahn, Blum and Langford,&lt;ref name=Ahn2003&gt;von Ahn, L;  M. Blum, N. J. Hopper, and J. Langford. (2003) "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". ''Proc. Eurocrypt'', pp. 294–311.
&lt;/ref&gt; "any program that passes the tests generated by a CAPTCHA can be used to solve a hard unsolved AI problem."&lt;ref&gt;Moy G, N Jones and C Harkless (2004) "Distortion estimation techniques in solving visual CAPTCHAs", Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that the advantages of using hard AI problems as a means for security are twofold. Either the problem goes unsolved and there remains a reliable method for distinguishing humans from computers, or the problem is solved and a difficult AI problem is resolved along with it. In the case of image and text based CAPTCHAs, if an AI were capable of accurately completing the task without exploiting flaws in a particular CAPTCHA design, then it would have solved the problem of developing an AI that is capable of complex [[object recognition]] in scenes.&lt;ref name=Ahn2003/&gt;

== Accessibility ==
{{See also|Web accessibility}}
[[File:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png|left|thumb|260px|Many websites require typing a CAPTCHA when creating an account to prevent spam]]

CAPTCHAs based on reading text — or other visual-perception tasks — prevent [[blindness|blind]] or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] users from accessing the protected resource.&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/ |title=Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |publisher=[[W3C]] |author=May, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CAPTCHAs do not have to be visual. Any hard [[artificial intelligence]] problem, such as [[speech recognition]], can be used as the basis of a CAPTCHA. Some implementations of CAPTCHAs permit users to opt for an audio CAPTCHA, though a 2011 paper demonstrated a technique for defeating the popular schemes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Romain|last2=Beauxis|first3=Hristo|last3=Perito|first4=Daniele|last4=Paskov|last5=fabry|first5=Celine|last6=Mitchell|first6=John C.|title=The failure of noise-based non-continuous audio captchas|journal= IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;P), 2011|year=2011|url=https://www.elie.net/publication/the-failure-of-noise-based-non-continuous-audio-captchas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-sighted users (for example blind users, or color blind people on a color-using test), visual CAPTCHAs present serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Shea, Michael |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/captcha-spambots-ebooks-and-the-turing-test |title=CAPTCHA: Spambots, eBooks and the Turing Test |date=19 November 2015 |publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because CAPTCHAs are designed to be unreadable by machines, common [[assistive technology]] tools such as [[screen readers]] cannot interpret them. Since sites may use CAPTCHAs as part of the initial registration process, or even every login, this challenge can completely block access. In certain jurisdictions, site owners could become targets of litigation if they are using CAPTCHAs that discriminate against certain people with disabilities. For example, a CAPTCHA may make a site incompatible with [[Section 508]] in the United States. In other cases, those with sight difficulties can choose to identify a word being read to them.

While providing an audio CAPTCHA allows blind users to read the text, it still hinders those who are both blind and deaf. According to sense.org.uk, about 4% of people over 60 in the UK have both [[deafblindness|vision and hearing impairments]]. There are about 23,000 people in the UK who have serious vision and hearing impairments. According to The National Technical Assistance Consortium for Children and Young Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind (NTAC), the number of deafblind children in the USA increased from 9,516 to 10,471 during the period 2004 to 2012.&lt;ref name=ncc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Child Count Annual Reports |url=http://nationaldb.org/library/page/2199 |date=November 30, 2012 |work=TA&amp;D Network|publisher=National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University quotes 1980 to 2007 estimates which suggest upwards of 35,000 fully deafblind adults in the USA.&lt;ref name=dstats&gt;{{cite web |last=Harrington |first=Tom|first2=Jane |last2=Rutherford |title=American deaf-blind population |url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=119476&amp;sid=1029203 |work=Deaf Statistics |publisher=Gallaudet University Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deafblind population estimates depend heavily on the degree of impairment used in the definition.

The use of CAPTCHA thus excludes a small number of individuals from using significant subsets of such common Web-based services as PayPal, Gmail, Orkut, Yahoo!, many forum and weblog systems, etc.

Even for perfectly sighted individuals, new generations of graphical CAPTCHAs, designed to overcome sophisticated recognition software, can be very hard or impossible to read.

A method of improving the CAPTCHA to ease the work with it was proposed by ProtectWebForm and was called "Smart CAPTCHA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104163541/http://protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archivedate=2016-11-04 |title=Smart Captcha |publisher=Protect Web Form .COM |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers advise to combine the CAPTCHA with JavaScript support. Since it is too hard for most of spam robots to parse and execute JavaScript, using a simple script which fills the CAPTCHA fields and hides the image and the field from human eyes was proposed.

One alternative method involves displaying to the user a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the image-based CAPTCHAs. These are sometimes referred to as MAPTCHAs (M = 'mathematical'). However, these may be difficult for users with a cognitive disorder.

Other kinds of challenges, such as those that require understanding the meaning of some text (e.g., a logic puzzle, trivia question, or instructions on how to create a password) can also be used as a CAPTCHA. Again, there is little research into their resistance against countermeasures.

== Circumvention ==

There are a few approaches to defeating CAPTCHAs: using cheap human labor to recognize them, exploiting bugs in the implementation that allow the attacker to completely bypass the CAPTCHA, and finally using [[machine learning]] to build an automated solver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jakobsson |first=Markus |title=The death of the Internet|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118062418.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former Google "click fraud czar" [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]], there are numerous services which solve CAPTCHAs automatically.&lt;ref name=ai-security&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosemajumder |first=Shuman |title=The Imitation Game: The New Frontline of Security |url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ai-security |agency=InfoQ| accessdate=8 December 2015 |newspaper=InfoQ |date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine learning-based attacks ===
In its earliest iterations there was not a systematic methodology for designing or evaluating CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref name=bursz /&gt; As a result, there were many instances in which CAPTCHAs were of a fixed length and therefore automated tasks could be constructed to successfully make educated guesses about where segmentation should take place. Other early CAPTCHAs contained limited sets of words, which made the test much easier to game. Still others made the mistake of relying too heavily on background confusion in the image. In each case, algorithms were created that were successfully able to complete the task by exploiting these design flaws. These methods proved brittle however, and slight changes to the CAPTCHA were easily able to thwart them. Modern CAPTCHAs like [[reCAPTCHA]] no longer rely just on fixed patterns but instead present variations of characters that are often collapsed together, making segmentation almost impossible. These newest iterations have been much more successful at warding off automated tasks.&lt;ref name=bursz2 /&gt;

[[File:Modern-captcha.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[reCAPTCHA]] challenge from 2007, containing the words "following finding". The waviness and horizontal stroke were added to increase the difficulty of breaking the CAPTCHA with a computer program.]]
[[File:Captchacat.png|thumb|A CAPTCHA usually has a text box directly underneath where the user should fill out the text that they see. In this case, 'sclt ..was here']]

In October 2013, artificial intelligence company [[Vicarious (Company)|Vicarious]] claimed that it had developed a generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm that was able to solve modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Nick|title=Vicarious claims its AI software can crack up to 90% of CAPTCHAs offered by Google, Yahoo and PayPal|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/10/28/vicarious-claims-ai-software-can-now-crack-90-captchas-google-yahoo-paypal/ |publisher=TNW}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Luis von Ahn]], a pioneer of early CAPTCHA and founder of reCAPTCHA, expressed skepticism, stating: "It's hard for me to be impressed since I see these every few months." He pointed out that 50 similar claims to that of Vicarious had been made since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hof |first=Robert |title=AI Startup Vicarious Claims Milestone In Quest To Build A Brain: Cracking CAPTCHA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/10/28/ai-startup-vicarious-claims-milestone-in-quest-to-build-a-brain-craking-captcha/|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 at Usenix WoOT conference, [[Elie Bursztein|Bursztein]] et al. presented the first generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm based on reinforcement learning and demonstrated its efficiency against many popular CAPTCHA schemas. They concluded that text distortion based CAPTCHAs schemes should be considered insecure moving forward.&lt;ref name="bursz2" /&gt;

=== Cheap or unwitting human labor ===
It is possible to subvert CAPTCHAs by relaying them to a [[sweatshop]] of human operators who are employed to decode CAPTCHAs. A 2005 paper from a [[W3C]] working group stated that such an operator "could easily verify hundreds of them each hour".&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility" /&gt; In 2010 the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] conducted a large scale study of those CAPTCHA's farms and found out that the retail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs is as low as $1,000.&lt;ref name="motoyama" /&gt;

Another technique used consists of using a script to re-post the target site's CAPTCHA as a CAPTCHA to a site owned by the attacker, which unsuspecting humans visit and correctly solve within a short while for the script to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |title=Solving and creating captchas with free porn |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |date=2004-01-27 |work=Boing Boing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209040456/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |archivedate=2006-02-09 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is controversy around the economic viability of such an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://petmail.lothar.com/design.html#auto34 | title = Hire People To Solve CAPTCHA Challenges | accessdate = 2015-04-27 | date = 2005-07-21 | work = Petmail Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insecure implementation ===
Howard Yeend has identified two implementation issues with poorly designed CAPTCHA systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.puremango.co.uk/cm_breaking_captcha_115.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170625165854/http://www.puremango.co.uk/2005/11/breaking_captcha_115/ | archivedate = 2017-06-25 | title = Breaking CAPTCHAs Without Using OCR | accessdate = 2006-08-22 | year = 2005 | work = (pureMango.co.uk)|first=Howard |last=Yeend }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some CAPTCHA protection systems can be bypassed without using [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] simply by reusing the session ID of a known CAPTCHA image
* CAPTCHAs residing on shared servers also present a problem; a security issue on another virtual host may leave the CAPTCHA issuer's site vulnerable

Sometimes, if part of the software generating the CAPTCHA is [[client-side]] (the validation is done on a server but the text that the user is required to identify is rendered on the client side), then users can modify the client to display the un-rendered text. Some CAPTCHA systems use [[MD5]] hashes stored client-side, which may leave the CAPTCHA vulnerable to a [[brute-force attack]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Notable attacks ===
Some notable attacks against various CAPTCHAs schemas include:
* Mori et al. published a paper in [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] CVPR'03 detailing a method for defeating one of the most popular CAPTCHAs, EZ-Gimpy, which was tested as being 92% accurate in defeating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403213029/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-03 |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2017-09-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same method was also shown to defeat the more complex and less-widely deployed Gimpy program 33% of the time. However, the existence of implementations of their algorithm in actual use is indeterminate at this time.
* PWNtcha has made significant progress in defeating commonly used CAPTCHAs, which has contributed to a general migration towards more sophisticated CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/ |title=PWNtcha – Caca Labs |publisher=Sam.zoy.org |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Podec, a trojan discovered by the security company Kaspersky, forwards CAPTCHA requests to an online human translation service that converts the image to text, fooling the system. Podec targets Android mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/kaspersky-discovers-captcha-duping-podec-malware/article/1478464|title=Kaspersky discovers CAPTCHA-duping Podec malware|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=SC Magazine UK|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative CAPTCHAs schemas ==
With the demonstration that text distortion based 
CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to machine learning based attacks, some researchers have proposed alternatives including image recognition CAPTCHAs which require users to identify simple objects in the images presented. The argument in favor of these schemes is that tasks like object recognition are typically more complex to perform than text recognition and therefore should be more resilient to machine learning based attacks. Here are some of notable alternative CAPTCHA schemas:
* Chew et al. published their work in the 7th International Information Security Conference, ISC'04, proposing three different versions of image recognition CAPTCHAs, and validating the proposal with user studies. It is suggested that one of the versions, the anomaly CAPTCHA, is best with 100% of human users being able to pass an anomaly CAPTCHA with at least 90% probability in 42 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Image_Recognition_CAPTCHAs/imagecaptcha.pdf |title=Image Recognition CAPTCHAs |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Datta et al. published their paper in the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Multimedia]] '05 Conference, named IMAGINATION (IMAge Generation for INternet AuthenticaTION), proposing a systematic way to image recognition CAPTCHAs. Images are distorted in such a way that state-of-the-art image recognition approaches (which are potential attack technologies) fail to recognize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/IMAGINATION/ACM05/ |title=Imagination Paper |publisher=Infolab.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Microsoft (Jeremy Elson, John R. Douceur, Jon Howell, and Jared Saul) have developed Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access (ASIRRA) which ask users to distinguish cats from dogs. Microsoft had a beta version of this for websites to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215032402/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/ |archivedate=15 December 2008 |title=Asirra is a human interactive proof that asks users to identify photos of cats and dogs |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim "Asirra is easy for users; it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Anecdotally, users seemed to find the experience of using Asirra much more enjoyable than a text-based CAPTCHA." This solution was described in a 2007 paper to Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |title=Asirra: A CAPTCHA that Exploits Interest-Aligned Manual Image Categorization}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this project was closed in October 2014 and is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112032323/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archivedate=12 January 2009 |title=Microsoft's Asirra project closed. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cancionero de Turin''''' or '''''Cancionero Musical de Turin''''' is a musical [[manuscript]] that contains Spanish secular [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] works from the period between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, in the transition period between the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.

== The manuscript ==
The manuscript is kept at the [[Turin National University Library|National University Library]] (R.1–14) in [[Turin]], Italy.

The index section lists 47 works, but one of them is duplicated. Th manuscript includes three other works that are not listed in the index, two of which are also duplicated. On the other hand, the works listed as numbers 36 and 37, ''Salte y baile'' and ''Mi voluntad no me dexa'' are in fact parts of a single work titled ''Por dinero baila el perro''. Therefore, the cancionero contains 46 individual works. One of them is for 4 voices, 35 are for 3 voices and the ten remaining are for 2 voices. The musical forms employed are the [[villancico]], the [[canción]] and the [[Romance (music)|romance]].

All the pieces are anonymous, but one of them, ''Sobre moradas violetas'', is also found in the [[Cancionero de la Sablonara]], attributed to the [[Sevillian]] guitarist and composer [[Juan de Palomares]], on a text by Catalina Zamudio.

Several texts were extracted from the [[romancero]] or were written by known authors, such as [[Lope de Vega]], Catalina Zamudio, etc.

'''Carolingian architecture''' is the style of north European [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] belonging to the period of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the late 8th and 9th centuries, when the [[Carolingian]] dynasty dominated west European politics. It was a conscious attempt to emulate [[Roman architecture]] and to that end it borrowed heavily from [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], though there are nonetheless innovations of its own, resulting in a unique character.

The gatehouse of the [[Lorsch Abbey|monastery at Lorsch]], built around 800, exemplifies [[Classical architecture|classical]] inspiration for Carolingian architecture, built as a triple-arched hall dominating the gateway, with the arched facade interspersed with attached [[Classical architecture|classical]] columns and [[pilasters]] above.

The [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] constructed between 792–805 was inspired by the octagonal [[Emperor Justinian|Justinian]] church of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in Ravenna, built in the 6th century, but at Aachen there is a tall monumental western entrance complex, as a whole called a ''[[westwork]]''—a Carolingian innovation.

Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885.

A '''clastogen''' is a [[mutagenic]] agent giving rise to or inducing disruption or breakages of [[chromosome]]s, leading to sections of the chromosome being deleted, added, or rearranged.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefort C., Fauth E., Zankl H.: Micronuclei induced by aneugens and clastogens in mononucleate and binucleate cells using cytokinesis block assay. Mutagenesis 19, pp. 277-284 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This process is a form of [[mutagenesis]], and can lead to [[carcinogenesis]], as cells that are not killed by the clastogenic effect may become cancerous. Known clastogens include [[acridine yellow]], [[benzene]], [[ethylene oxide]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphine]] and [[mimosine]]. Exposure to clastogens increases frequency of abnormal germ cells in paternal males, contributing to developmental effects in the fetus upon fertilization.

'''Computational anatomy''' is an interdisciplinary field of [[biology]] focused on quantitative investigation and modelling of anatomical shapes variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.inria.fr/asclepios/research/computational-anatomy/|title=Computational Anatomy – Asclepios|website=team.inria.fr|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icm.jhu.edu/research-areas-2/computational-anatomy/|title=JHU – Institute for Computational Medicine {{!}}   Computational Anatomy|website=icm.jhu.edu|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures.

The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], [[machine learning]], [[computational mechanics]], [[computational science]], [[biological imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]; it also has strong connections with [[fluid mechanics]] and [[geometric mechanics]]. Additionally, it complements newer, interdisciplinary fields like [[bioinformatics]] and [[neuroinformatics]] in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities (of which [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is one example). It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. It is similar in spirit to the history of [[Computational linguistics]], a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the [[sensor]] acting as the [[transmission medium|transmission]] and communication medium(s).

In computational anatomy, the [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|flows between coordinates in Computational anatomy]] are constrained to be [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit|geodesic flows]] satisfying [[Computational anatomy#The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows|the principle of least action for the Kinetic energy of the flow]]. The kinetic energy is defined through a [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|Sobolev smoothness]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; norm with strictly more than two generalized, [[square-integrable function|square-integrable]] derivatives for each component of the flow velocity, which guarantees that the flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are diffeomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2693614|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|last = Dupuis|first = Paul|authorlink = |last2 = Grenander|first2 = Ulf|authorlink2 = |others = |authorlink3 = |last3 = Miller, Michael|author-first# = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It also implies that the [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|diffeomorphic shape momentum]] taken pointwise satisfying the [[Computational anatomy#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms|Euler-Lagrange equation for geodesics]] is determined by its neighbors through spatial derivatives on the velocity field.  This separates the discipline from the case of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluids]]&lt;ref name=MR202082&gt;{{Cite journal |mr=202082 |title=Sur la géomérie différentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications à l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits |journal= Ann. Inst. Fourier |volume=16 |year=1966 |issue=1 |pages=319–361 |language=French|last = Arnold|first = V. |doi=10.5802/aif.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which momentum is a pointwise function of velocity. Computational anatomy intersects the study of [[Riemannian manifolds]] and nonlinear [[global analysis]], where groups of diffeomorphisms are the central focus. Emerging high-dimensional theories of shape&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Laurent Younes |title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642120541|date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are central to many studies in Computational anatomy, as are questions emerging from the fledgling field of [[shape statistics]].
The metric structures in Computational anatomy are related in spirit to [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of [[coordinate system]]s transformed by a [[diffeomorphism]], hence the central use of the terminology [[#Diffeomorphometry: The Metric Space of Shapes and Forms|'''diffeomorphometry''']], the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms.

==Genesis==
At Computational anatomy's heart is the comparison of shape by recognizing in one shape the other. This connects it to [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s developments [[On Growth and Form]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which has led to scientific explanations of [[morphogenesis]], the process by which [[patterns]] are formed in [[Biology]]. [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Durer]]'s Four Books on Human Proportion were arguably the earliest works on Computational anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg [sic.] erfunden und beschuben zu nutz allen denen so zu diser kunst lieb tragen|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|year=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uthscsa.edu/2012/03/albrecht-durers-human-proportions/|title=Albrecht Dürer's Human Proportions "  UT Health Science Center Library|last=Library|first=State of Texas, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|website=library.uthscsa.edu|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/printed-books-and-bindings/73192|title=Albrecht Dürer|website=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Noam Chomsky]] in his pioneering of [[Computational Linguistics]] inspired the original formulation of Computational anatomy as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q.

Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), Computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D. The spirit of this discipline shares strong overlap with areas such as [[computer vision]] and [[kinematics]] of [[rigid bodies]], where objects are studied by analysing the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] responsible for the movement in question. Computational anatomy departs from computer vision with its focus on rigid motions, as the infinite-dimensional diffeomorphism group is central to the analysis of Biological shapes. It is a branch of the image analysis and pattern theory school at Brown University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brown University -- Pattern Theory Group: Home|url = http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/participants.shtml|website = www.dam.brown.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered by [[Ulf Grenander]]. In Grenander's general Metric [[Pattern Theory]], making spaces of '''patterns''' into a [[Complete metric space|metric space]] is one of the fundamental operations since being able to cluster and recognize anatomical configurations often requires a metric of close and far between shapes. The [[Computational anatomy#The Right Invariant Metric on Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphometry metric]]&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt; of Computational anatomy measures how far two diffeomorphic changes of coordinates are from each other, which in turn induces a [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on Shapes and Forms|metric on the shapes and images]] indexed to them. The models of metric pattern theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = General Pattern Theory : A Mathematical Study of Regular Structures |author=Grenander, Ulf |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198536710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference|author = U. Grenander and M. I.

==History==
Computational anatomy is the study of shape and form at the [[morphome]] or [[gross anatomy]] millimeter, or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] scale, focusing on the study of sub-[[manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3,&lt;/math&gt; points, curves surfaces and subvolumes of human anatomy.
An early modern computational neuro-anatomist was David Van Essen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two-dimensional maps of the cerebral cortex |journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date = 1980-05-15 |pmid = 7410593|pages = 255–281|volume = 191|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/cne.901910208|first = D. C.|last = Van Essen|first2 = J. H.|last2 = Maunsell}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing some of the early physical unfoldings of the human brain based on printing of a human cortex and cutting. [[Jean Talairach|Jean Talairach's]]  publication of [[Talairach coordinates|Tailarach coordinates]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is an important milestone at the morphome scale demonstrating the fundamental basis of local coordinate systems in studying neuroanatomy and therefore the clear link to [[Differential geometry|charts of differential geometry]]. Concurrently, virtual mapping in Computational anatomy across high resolution dense image coordinates was already happening in [[Ruzena Bajcsy|Ruzena Bajcy's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiresolution Elastic Matching |journal = Comput.

The first formalization of Computational Anatomy as an orbit of exemplar templates under [[diffeomorphism]] [[group action]] was in the original lecture given by Grenander and Miller with that title in May 1997 at the 50th Anniversary of the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=   Walter Freiberger |title = Current and Future Challenges in the Applications of Mathematics |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publication.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This was the basis for the strong departure from much of the previous work on advanced methods for [[spatial normalization]] and [[image registration]] which were historically built on notions of addition and basis expansion. The structure preserving transformations central to the modern field of Computational Anatomy, [[homeomorphism]]s and [[diffeomorphism]]s carry smooth submanifolds smoothly. They are generated via [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian flows]] which &lt;nowiki/&gt;satisfy a law of composition of functions forming the group property, but are not additive.

The original model of Computational anatomy was as the triple, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}) \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; the group  &lt;math&gt; g \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt;, the orbit of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, and the probability laws &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which encode the variations of the objects in the orbit. The template or collection of templates are elements in the orbit &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal {M} &lt;/math&gt; of shapes.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the equations of motion of Computational Anatomy took off post 1997 with several pivotal meetings including the 1997 Luminy meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colloque Mathematiques et reconnaissance de formes|url = https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/MSPCV/luminy.html|website = www.ceremade.dauphine.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Azencott&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Azencott, mathématicien polyglotte {{!}} La Recherche|url = http://www.larecherche.fr/actualite/aussi/robert-azencott-mathematicien-polyglotte-01-12-2000-70634|website = www.larecherche.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; school at [[École Normale Supérieure|Ecole-Normale Cachan]] on the "Mathematics of Shape Recognition" and the 1998 Trimestre at [[Institut Henri Poincaré|Institute Henri Poincar]]é organized by [[David Mumford]] "Questions Mathématiques en Traitement du Signal et de l'Image"  which catalyzed the Hopkins-Brown-ENS Cachan groups and subsequent developments and connections of Computational anatomy to developments in global analysis.

These contributions of Computational anatomy to the global analysis associated to the infinite dimensional manifolds of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group is far from trivial. The original idea of doing differential geometry, curvature and geodesics on infinite dimensional manifolds goes back to [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s [[Habilitation]] (Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/|title=Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen|website=www.maths.tcd.ie|access-date=2016-03-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318034045/http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9783642351204|author=Bernhard Riemann |title=Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie |publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the key modern book laying the foundations of such ideas in global analysis are from Michor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter W.

==The deformable template orbit model of computational anatomy==
The model of human anatomy is a deformable template, an orbit of exemplars under group action. Deformable template models have been central to Grenander's Metric Pattern theory, accounting for typicality via templates, and accounting for variability via transformation of the template. An orbit under group action as the representation of the deformable template is a classic formulation from differential geometry.  The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[group action|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m = g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m  = g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;, being homogenous under the action of the elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Medial-temporal-lobe-structures.png|alt=FIgure showing different examples of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy from MR imager.|thumb|Figure depicting three medial temporal lobe structures amgydala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with fiducial landmarks depicted as well embedded in the MRI background.]]
The orbit model of computational anatomy is an abstract algebra - to be compared to [[linear algebra]]- since the groups act nonlinearly on the shapes. This is a generalization of the classical models of linear algebra, in which the set of finite dimensional &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^n &lt;/math&gt; vectors are replaced by the finite-dimensional anatomical submanifolds (points, curves, surfaces and volumes) and images of them, and the &lt;math&gt; n \times n &lt;/math&gt; matrices of linear algebra are replaced by coordinate transformations based on linear and affine groups and the more general high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups.

==Shapes and forms==
The central objects are shapes or forms in Computational anatomy, one set of examples being the 0,1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, a second set of examples being images generated via [[medical imaging]] such as via [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. [[File:Subcortical-MRI-caudate-putamen.png|alt=Figure showing triangualted meshes generated from populations of many segmented MRI brains. Each different surface represents a different shape in shape space.|thumb|Triangulated mesh surfaces depicting subcortical structures amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, ventricles.The shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U\subset {\mathbb R}^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; represented as triangulated meshes.]] The 0-dimensional manifolds are landmarks or fiducial points; 1-dimensional manifolds are curves such as sulcul and gyral curves in the brain; 2-dimensional manifolds correspond to boundaries of substructures in anatomy such as the subcortical structures of the [[midbrain]] or the gyral surface of the [[neocortex]];  subvolumes correspond to subregions of the human body, the [[heart]], the [[thalamus]], the kidney.

The landmarks &lt;math&gt; X \doteq \{ x_1,\dots,x_n \} \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are a collections of points with no other structure, delineating important fiducials within human shape and form (see associated landmarked image).
The sub-[[manifold]] shapes such as surfaces &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are collections of points modeled as parametrized by a local chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m:U \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure showing shapes as mesh surfaces).
The images such as MR images or DTI images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and are dense functions
&lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2,3} &lt;/math&gt; are scalars, vectors, and matrices (see Figure showing scalar image).

==Groups and group actions==
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy}}[[File:T1-weighted-MRI.png|alt=Two-dimensional scalar image depicting a section through a 3D brain at the level of the subcortical structures showing white, gray and CSF matter.|thumb|Showing an MRI section through a 3D brain representing a scalar image &lt;math&gt;I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; based on T1-weighting.]][[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s and [[group actions]] are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of [[linear algebra]] as a basic model for analyzing [[signals and systems]] in [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied mathematics]]. In linear algebra the matrix groups (matrices with inverses) are the central structure, with group action defined by the usual definition of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, acting on &lt;math&gt;x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \times 1&lt;/math&gt;  vectors; the orbit in linear-algebra is the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vectors given by &lt;math&gt;y = A \cdot x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a group action of the matrices through the orbit of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The central group in Computational anatomy defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[diffeomorphisms]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq Diff&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= id&lt;/math&gt;.

Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
&lt;/math&gt;.

For sub-[[manifold]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

Several [[group actions in computational anatomy]] have been defined.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms==
For the study of [[rigid body]] [[kinematics]], the low-dimensional matrix [[Lie groups]] have been the central focus. The matrix groups are low-dimensional mappings, which are diffeomorphisms that provide one-to-one correspondences between coordinate systems, with a smooth inverse. The [[matrix group]] of rotations and scales can be generated via a closed form finite-dimensional matrices which are solution of simple ordinary differential equations with solutions given by the matrix exponential.

For the study of deformable shape in Computational anatomy, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional differeomorphism groups used in Computational Anatomy are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt; \phi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; as first introduced in.,&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–14472"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=G.

==The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy==
The group of diffeomorphisms is very big. To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms avoiding [[Advection#Solving the equation|shock-like solutions]] for the inverse,  the vector fields must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;P.

The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

{{Hide | Sobolev smoothness and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with Green's kernel |

===The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space===

The modelling approach used in Computational anatomy enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; as a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, Green's inverse &lt;math&gt;K = A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The norm of the Hilbert space is induced by the differential operator.  For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a generalized function or distribution, define the linear form as &lt;math&gt; (\sigma|w)\doteq \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i(dx)
&lt;/math&gt;. This determines the norm on &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av \cdot v dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator, finiteness of the norm-square &lt;math&gt;  (Av|v) &lt; \infty
&lt;/math&gt; includes derivatives from the differential operator implying smoothness of the vector fields.The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows.
For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;  termed the [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]] (scalar case) for the vector field case. The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)
&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K\sigma (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) \sigma_j(dy)

Oftentimes, the familiar Euclidean metric is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a vector space. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot m \in \mathcal {M}, \phi \in Diff_V, m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method we use to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is&lt;nowiki/&gt; used to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

==The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows==

In classical mechanics the evolution of physical systems is described by solutions to the Euler–Lagrange equations associated to the [[Least-action principle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of [[Hamilton's principle|Hamilton]]. This is a standard way, for example of obtaining [[Newton's laws of motion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of free particles. More generally, the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived for systems of [[generalized coordinates]]. The Euler-Lagrange equation in Computational anatomy describes the geodesic shortest path flows between coordinate systems of the diffeomorphism metric. In Computational anatomy the generalized coordinates are the flow of the diffeomorphism and its Lagrangian velocity &lt;math&gt;\phi, \dot{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the two related via the Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v \doteq \dot{\phi} \circ \phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
[[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] for generating the Euler-Lagrange equation requires the action integral on the Lagrangian given by 
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;J(\phi) \doteq \int_0^1 L(\phi_t,\dot \phi_t) dt \ ;&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Integrated-Lagrangian}}}}
the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
 L(\phi_t, \dot \phi_t ) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_X A (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}) \cdot (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} ) dx
= \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \ dx \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}}}

==Diffeomorphic or Eulerian shape momentum==
In computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; was first called the '''Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MILLER|first=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy |journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0 |pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density, and since there is a [[Computational anatomy#Conservation laws on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy|conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum]] which holds. The operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator.

==The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}

Classical calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equation from [[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] requires the perturbation of the Lagrangian on the vector field in the kinetic energy with respect to first order perturbation of the flow. This requires adjustment by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket of vector field]], given by operator &lt;math&gt; ad_v: w \in V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt;  which involves the Jacobian given by 
:&lt;math&gt; ad_v[w]\doteq [v,w]\doteq (Dv)w-(Dw)v \in V &lt;/math&gt;.
:
Defining the adjoint &lt;math&gt; ad_v^*: V^* \rightarrow V^*,  &lt;/math&gt; then the first order variation gives the Eulerian shape momentum &lt;math&gt;Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the generalized equation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t)=0  \ , \ t \in [0,1] \  ;
&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|EL-General}}}}

meaning for all smooth &lt;math&gt; w \in V ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X \left( \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t) \right) \cdot w dx =  \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot  w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;

Computational anatomy is the study of the motions of submanifolds, points, curves, surfaces and volumes.
Momentum associated to points, curves and surfaces are all singular, implying the momentum is concentrated on subsets of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; which are dimension &lt;math&gt; \leq 2 &lt;/math&gt; in [[Lebesgue measure]]. In such cases, the energy is still well defined &lt;math&gt; (Av_t\mid v_t) &lt;/math&gt; since although &lt;math&gt; Av_t &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function, the vector fields are smooth and the Eulerian momentum is understood via its action on smooth functions. The perfect illustration of this is even when it is a superposition of delta-diracs, the velocity of the coordinates in the entire volume move smoothly.The Euler-Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}}) on diffeomorphisms for generalized functions &lt;math&gt; Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; was derived in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;M.I. Miller, A. Trouve, L. Younes, Geodesic Shooting in Computational Anatomy, IJCV, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation on Geodesics]] derivations are provided in terms of the adjoint operator and the Lie bracket for the group of diffeomorphisms. It has come to be called EPDiff equation for diffeomorphisms connecting to the Euler-Poincare method having been studied in the context of the inertial operator &lt;math&gt;A=identity&lt;/math&gt;  for incompressible, divergence free, fluids.&lt;ref name="Mumford" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holm | first1 = DD | last2 = Marsden | first2 = JE | last3 = Ratiu | first3 = TS | year = 1998 | title = The Euler-Poincaré equations and semidirect products with applications to continuum theories | url = | journal = Adv.

===Diffeomorphic shape momentum: a classical vector function===
For the momentum density case &lt;math&gt; (Av_t \mid w) =\int_X \mu_t \cdot w \, dx &lt;/math&gt;, then Euler–Lagrange equation has a classical solution:{{NumBlk|:|

==Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In Medical imaging and Computational anatomy, positioning and coordinatizing shapes are fundamental operations; the system for positioning anatomical coordinates and shapes built on the metric and the Euler-Lagrange equation a geodesic positioning system as first explicated in Miller Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt;
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; Exp_{\rm id}(\cdot): V \to Diff_V
&lt;/math&gt; at identity to the group.

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt;
Exp_{id} (v_0)= \phi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t, t \in [0,1]  
&lt;/math&gt;,
* for classical equation diffeomorphic shape momentum &lt;math&gt;\int_X Av_t \cdot w \, dx &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Av \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

Av \in V^* 
&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; w \in V &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \ \  \ \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot  w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t)dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  Log_{ id}( \varphi) = v_0 \ \text{initial condition of EL geodesic } \dot \phi_0 = v_0, \phi_0=id,  \phi_1=\varphi \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

Extended to the entire group they become

&lt;math&gt;
\phi= Exp_\varphi(v_0\circ \varphi) \doteq Exp_{id} (v_0) \circ \varphi
&lt;/math&gt; ;   &lt;math&gt;
 Log_\varphi(\phi)\doteq Log_{id}( \phi \circ\varphi^{-1}) \circ \varphi
&lt;/math&gt; .

These are inverses of each other for unique solutions of Logarithm; the first is called '''geodesic positioning,''' the latter '''geodesic coordinates''' (see [[Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|Exponential map, Riemannian geometry]] for the finite dimensional version).'''The geodesic metric''' is a local flattening of the Riemannian coordinate system (see figure). 
[[File:FigBrain.png|thumb|Showing metric local flattening of coordinatized manifolds of shapes and forms. The local metric is given by the norm of the vector field &lt;math&gt;\|v_0\|_V&lt;/math&gt; of the geodesic mapping &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;]]

==Hamiltonian formulation of computational anatomy==

In Computational anatomy the diffeomorphisms are used to push the coordinate systems, and the vector fields are used
as the control within the
anatomical orbit or morphological space. The model is that of a dynamical system, the flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; and the control the vector field &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto v_t \in V&lt;/math&gt; related via &lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t \cdot \phi_t,\phi_0=id . &lt;/math&gt;  The Hamiltonian view

H(\phi_t,p_t,v_t)=\int_X p_t \cdot (v_t \circ \phi_t) dx-\frac{1}{2}\int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx .&lt;/math&gt;

This function is the extended Hamiltonian. The [[Pontryagin maximum principle]]&lt;ref name="Miller null2"/&gt; gives the optimizing vector field which determines the geodesic flow satisfying &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t , \phi_0=id,&lt;/math&gt; as well as the reduced Hamiltonian 
:&lt;math&gt; H(\phi_t,p_t) \doteq \max_v H( \phi_t, p_t,v) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The Lagrange multiplier in its action as a linear form has its own inner product of the canonical momentum acting on the velocity of the flow which is dependent on the shape, e.g. for landmarks a sum, for surfaces a surface integral, and. for volumes it is a volume integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases the Greens kernels carry weights which are the canonical momentum evolving according to an ordinary differential equation which corresponds to EL but is the geodesic reparameterization in canonical momentum. The optimizing vector field is given by
:&lt;math&gt;v_t \doteq \arg max_{v} H(\phi_t,p_t,v)&lt;/math&gt;
with dynamics of canonical momentum reparameterizing the vector field along the geodesic

===Stationarity of the Hamiltonian and kinetic energy along Euler–Lagrange===
Whereas the vector fields are extended across the entire background space of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, the geodesic flows associated to the submanifolds has Eulerian shape momentum which evolves as a generalized function &lt;math&gt;Av_t \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; concentrated to the submanifolds.

For surfaces, the momentum is a [[Computational anatomy#Surface geodesics|surface integral of delta distributions]] travelling with the surface.&lt;ref name="Miller 36" /&gt;

The geodesics connecting coordinate systems satisfying {{EquationNote|EL-General}} have stationarity of the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian is given by the extremum along the path &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H(\phi,p) = \max_v H(\phi,p,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, equalling the {{EquationNote|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}  and is stationary along {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. Defining the geodesic velocity at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 = \arg \max_v H(\phi_0,p_0,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, then along the geodesic
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;H(\phi_t,p_t) = H(\phi_0,p_0)=\frac{1}{2} \int_X p_0 \cdot v_0 dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_0 \cdot v_0 dx=\frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx

==The metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit==
In Computational anatomy the submanifolds are pointsets, curves, surfaces and subvolumes which are the basic primitives. The geodesic flows between the submanifolds determine the distance, and form the basic measuring and transporting tools of [[diffeomorphometry]]. At  &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the geodesic has vector field &lt;math&gt;v_0 = K p_0&lt;/math&gt; determined by the conjugate momentum and the Green's kernel of the inertial operator defining the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;K=A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The metric distance between coordinate systems connected via the geodesic determined by the induced distance between identity and group element:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{Diff_V}(id,\varphi) = \|Log_{id}(\varphi)\|_V=\| v_0 \|_V = \sqrt{2H(id,p_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

==[[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]]s on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy==
Given the least-action there is a natural definition of momentum associated to generalized coordinates; the quantity acting against velocity gives energy. The field has studied two forms, the momentum associated to the Eulerian vector field termed '''Eulerian diffeomorphic shape momentum''', and the momentum associated to the initial coordinates or canonical coordinates termed '''canonical diffeomorphic shape momentum'''. Each has a conservation law.The conservation of momentum goes hand in hand with the {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. In Computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is the Eulerian [[Momentum]] since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density; operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator which acting on the Eulerian velocity gives momentum which is conserved along the geodesic: {{NumBlk|:|

===Matching based on minimizing kinetic energy action with endpoint condition===

&lt;math&gt;\text{min}_{\phi:v= \dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}, \phi_0=id} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx dt +E( \phi_1)

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}

\text{Boundary Condition}  &amp;  \ \ \ \phi_0=id,  Av_1 =- \frac{\partial E(\phi)}{\partial \phi}|_{\phi=\phi_1} \ .
\end{cases}

Conservation from {{EquationNote|EL-General}} extends the B.C. at &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt; to the rest of the path &lt;math&gt;
t \in [0,1)
&lt;/math&gt; .The inexact matching problem with the endpoint matching term &lt;math&gt;E(\phi_1)&lt;/math&gt; has several alternative forms. One of the key ideas of the stationarity of the Hamiltonian along the geodesic solution is the integrated running cost reduces to initial cost at t=0, geodesics of the {{EquationNote|EL-General}} are determined by their initial condition &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The running cost is reduced to the initial cost determined by &lt;math&gt;v_0=Kp_0&lt;/math&gt; of  {{EquationNote|Kernel-Surf.-Land.-Geodesics}}.

===Matching based on geodesic shooting===

:&lt;math&gt;\min_{v_0} C(v_0) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_0 \cdot v_0 dx
   +E(\mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0) \cdot I_0) \ ;
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{p_0} C(p_0) =
   \frac{1}{2}\int_X p_0 \cdot Kp_0 dx+ E(\mathrm{Exp}_\text{id}(Kp_0) \cdot I_0)
   &lt;/math&gt;
The matching problem explicitly indexed to initial condition &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is called shooting, which can also be reparamerized via the conjugate momentum &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Coordinate system transformation based on DTI imaging has exploited two actions 
[[Group actions in computational anatomy#Tensor matrices|one based on the principle eigen-vector or entire matrix]].

LDDMM matching based on the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor matrix
takes the image &lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; as a unit vector field defined by the first eigenvector. The group action becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi \cdot I =
\begin{cases}
\frac{D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1} \|I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|}{\|D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|} &amp; I\circ \varphi \neq 0; \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

LDDMM matching based on the entire tensor matrix
has group action becomes &lt;math&gt;\varphi \cdot M =   (\lambda_1 \hat{e}_1 \hat{e}_1^{T}+\lambda_2 \hat{e}_2 \hat{e}_2^{T} +\lambda_3 \hat{e}_3 \hat{e}_3^{T}) \circ \varphi^{-1} , &lt;/math&gt; transformed eigenvectors

===High Angular Resolution Diffusion Image (HARDI) matching in computational anatomy===
{{Further| Group actions in computational anatomy | LDDMM#LDDMM ODF}}

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries. HARDI can be used to reconstruct an [[orientation distribution function]] (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Dense LDDMM ODF matching &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes the HARDI data as ODF at each voxel and solves the LDDMM variational problem in the space of ODF. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The variational problem for matching assumes that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1], &lt;/math&gt; starting from
the identity map &lt;math&gt;\phi_0={id} &lt;/math&gt;. Denote the action of the diffeomorphism on template  as &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; are respectively the coordinates of the unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt; and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:
This group action of diffeomorphisms on ODF reorients the ODF and reflects changes in both the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; and the sampling directions of &lt;math&gt; \bf s &lt;/math&gt; due to affine transformation. It guarantees that the volume fraction of fibers oriented toward a small patch must remain the same after the patch is transformed. 
:
The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C(v) = \inf_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{x\in\Omega}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

where the logarithm of &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.

For setting in which pairs of images are not related by diffeomorphisms but have photometric variation or image variation not represented by the template, [[active appearance model]]ling has been introduced, originally by Edwards-Cootes-Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Active appearance models |publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 1998-06-02|isbn = 9783540646136|pages = 484–498|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |first = T.

In the context of Computational Anatomy in which metrics on the anatomical orbit has been studied, '''metamorphosis''' for modelling structures such as tumors and photometric changes which are not resident in the template was introduced in&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; for Magnetic Resonance image models, with many subsequent developments extending the metamorphosis framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Metamorphoses Through Lie Group Action|date = 2005-01-01|first = Alain|last = Trouvé|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|citeseerx = 10.1.1.157.8752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = The Euler-Poincare theory of Metamorphosis |eprint=0806.0870 |date = 2008-06-04|first = Darryl D.|last = Holm|first2 = Alain|last2 = Trouve|first3 = Laurent|last3 = Younes|class=cs.CV }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = Metamorphosis of Images in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces|eprint=1409.6573|date = 2014-09-23|first = Casey L.|last = Richardson|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|class=math.OC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For image matching the image metamorphosis framework enlarges the action so that &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto (\phi_t,I_t) &lt;/math&gt; with action &lt;math&gt; \phi_t \cdot I_t \doteq I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}  &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting metamorphosis combines both the diffeomorphic coordinate system transformation of Computational Anatomy as well as the early [[morphing]] technologies which only faded or modified the photometric or image intensity alone.

Then the matching problem takes a form with equality boundary conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{(v,I)}
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left( \int_X A v_t \cdot v_t dx +
\| \dot I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} \|^2 / \sigma^2 \right) \, dt  \text{ subject to} \ \phi_0=id, I_0=\text{fixed}, I_1=\text{fixed}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matching landmarks, curves, surfaces==
Transforming coordinate systems based on [[Landmark point]] or [[fiducial marker]] features dates back to Bookstein's early work on small deformation spline methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations|url = http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/1989/06/i0567.pdf|journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date = 1989-01-01 |pages = 567–585|volume = 11|issue = 6|doi = 10.1109/34.24792|first = F. L.|last = Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; for interpolating correspondences defined by fiducial points to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional background space in which the fiducials are defined. Large deformation landmark methods came on in the late 90's.&lt;ref name="Miller 209–228"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi 1357–1370"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geodesic Interpolating Splines|url = |doi=10.1007/3-540-44745-8_34|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2001-09-03|isbn = 9783540425236|pages = 513–527|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Vincent|last = Camion|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|editor-first = Mário|editor-last = Figueiredo|editor-first2 = Josiane|editor-last2 = Zerubia|editor-first3 = Anil K.|editor-last3 = Jain|citeseerx = 10.1.1.57.7394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above Figure depicts a series of landmarks associated three brain structures, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus.

Matching geometrical objects like unlabelled point distributions, curves or surfaces is another common problem in Computational Anatomy. Even in the discrete setting where these are commonly given as vertices with meshes, there are no predetermined correspondences between points as opposed to the situation of landmarks described above. From the theoretical point of view, while any submanifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized in local charts &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{0,1,2,3} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, all reparametrizations of these charts give geometrically the same manifold. Therefore, early on in Computational anatomy, investigators have identified the necessity of parametrization invariant representations. One indispensable requirement is that the end-point matching term between two submanifolds is itself independent of their parametrizations. This can be achieved via concepts and methods borrowed from [[Geometric measure theory]], in particular [[Current (mathematics)|currents]]&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surface matching via currents |journal = Information Processing in Medical Imaging: Proceedings of the ...

===Measure matching: unregistered landmarks===
Glaunes and co-workers first introduced diffeomorphic matching of pointsets in the general setting of matching distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glaunes|first=J.|last2=Trouve|first2=A.|last3=Younes|first3=L.|date=2004-06-01|title=Diffeomorphic matching of distributions: a new approach for unlabelled point-sets and sub-manifolds matching|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1315234&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fxpls%252Fabs_all.jsp%253Farnumber%253D1315234|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2004. CVPR 2004|volume=2|pages=II–712–II–718 Vol.2|doi=10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315234|isbn=978-0-7695-2158-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.4209}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to landmarks, this includes in particular the situation of weighted point clouds with no predefined correspondences and possibly different cardinalities. The template and target discrete point clouds are represented as two weighted sums of Diracs &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m^\prime} = \sum_{i=1}^{n^\prime} \rho^{\prime}_{i} \delta_{x^{\prime}_{i}} &lt;/math&gt; living in the space of [[signed measure]]s of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The space is equipped with a Hilbert metric obtained from a real positive kernel &lt;math&gt; k(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, giving the following norm:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mu_{m} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \rho_i \rho_j k(x_i,x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;

The matching problem between a template and target point cloud may be then formulated using this kernel metric for the endpoint matching term:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mu_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{\phi_1(x_i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the distribution transported by the deformation.

===Curve matching===
In the one dimensional case, a curve in 3D can be represented by an embedding &lt;math&gt; m: u \in [0,1] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, and the group action of ''Diff'' becomes &lt;math&gt; \phi \cdot m = \phi \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. However, the correspondence between curves and embeddings is not one to one as the any reparametrization &lt;math&gt;m \circ \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of the interval [0,1], represents geometrically the same curve. In order to preserve this invariance in the end-point matching term, several extensions of the previous 0-dimensional measure matching approach can be considered.

* '''Curve matching with currents'''
In the situation of oriented curves, currents give an efficient setting to construct invariant matching terms. In such representation, curves are interpreted as elements of a functional space dual to the space vector fields, and compared through kernel norms on these spaces. Matching of two curves &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m^\prime&lt;/math&gt; writes eventually as the variational problem

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 K_C(m(u),m(v)) \partial m(u) \cdot \partial m(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

the derivative &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; being the tangent vector to the curve and &lt;math&gt; K_{\mathcal{C}} &lt;/math&gt; a given matrix kernel of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. Such expressions are invariant to any positive reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m'&lt;/math&gt;, and thus still depend on the orientation of the two curves.

* '''Curve matching with varifolds'''
Varifold is an alternative to currents when orientation becomes an issue as for instance in situations involving multiple bundles of curves for which no "consistent" orientation may be defined. Varifolds directly extend 0-dimensional measures by adding an extra tangent space direction to the position of points, leading to represent curves as measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the [[Grassmannian]] of all straight lines in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The matching problem between two curves then consists in replacing the endpoint matching term by &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{V}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{V}_{m^\prime} \|_{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; with varifold norms of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_m \|_{var}^2 = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^1 k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\partial m(u)],[\partial m(v)] \right) {{|}}\partial m(u){{|}} {{|}}\partial m(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\partial m(u)]&lt;/math&gt; is the non-oriented line directed by tangent vector &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathbb{R}^3}, k_{\mathbf{Gr}}&lt;/math&gt; two scalar kernels respectively on  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian. Due to the inherent non-oriented nature of the Grassmannian representation, such expressions are invariant to positive and negative reparametrizations.

===Surface matching===
Surface matching share many similarities with the case of curves. Surfaces in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; are parametrized in local charts by embeddings &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with all reparametrizations &lt;math&gt; m\circ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of U being equivalent geometrically. Currents and varifolds can be also used to formalize surface matching.

* '''Surface matching with currents'''
Oriented surfaces can be represented as 2-currents which are dual to differential 2-forms. In &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, one can further identify 2-forms with vector fields through the standard wedge product of 3D vectors. In that setting, surface matching writes again:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; given through the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} K_C(m(u),m(v)) \vec{n}(u) \cdot \vec{n}(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt; \vec{n} = \partial_{u_1} m \wedge \partial_{u_2} m &lt;/math&gt; the normal vector to the surface parametrized by &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt;.

This surface mapping algorithm has been validated for brain cortical surfaces against CARET and FreeSurfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=J|last2=Phua|first2=DY|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Quantitative evaluation of LDDMM, FreeSurfer, and CARET for cortical surface mapping|journal=NeuroImage|date=2010|volume=52|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.085|pmid=20381626}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDDMM mapping for multiscale surfaces is discussed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=M|last2=Qiu|first2=A|title=Large Deformation Multiresolution Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping for Multiresolution Cortical Surfaces: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach|journal=IEEE Trans Image Process.|date=2016|volume=25|issue=9|pages=4061–4074|doi=10.1109/TIP.2016.2574982|pmid=27254865|bibcode=2016ITIP...25.4061T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Surface matching with varifolds'''
For non-orientable or non-oriented surfaces, the varifold framework is often more adequate. Identifying the parametric surface &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; with a varifold &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{V}_m &lt;/math&gt; in the space of measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian, one simply replaces the previous current metric &lt;math&gt; \| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 &lt;/math&gt; by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_{m} \|_\mathrm{var}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\vec{n}(u)],[\vec{n}(v)] \right) {{|}}\vec{n}(u){{|}} {{|}}\vec{n}(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\vec{n}(u)] &lt;/math&gt; is the (non-oriented) line directed by the normal vector to the surface.

An observed time sequence is given and the goal is to infer the time flow of geometric change of coordinates carrying the exemplars or templars through the period of observations.

The generic time-series matching problem considers the series of times is &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \dots t_K = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The flow optimizes at the series of costs &lt;math&gt;E(t_k), k=1, \dots, K&lt;/math&gt; giving optimization problems of the form

Depicted in the figure is a depiction of the random orbits around each exemplar, &lt;math&gt;m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by randomizing the flow by generating the initial tangent space vector field at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 \in V&lt;/math&gt;, and then generating random object &lt;math&gt;n \doteq Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy==
{{Further|Statistical shape analysis|Shape theory (mathematics)}}

[[Shape]] in computational anatomy is a local theory, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are [[bijectively]] mapped. [[Statistical shape analysis|Statistical shape]] in Computational Anatomy is the empirical study of diffeomorphic correspondences between populations and common template coordinate systems.  This is a strong departure from [[Procrustes|Procrustes Analyses]] and shape theories pioneered by [[David George Kendall|David G. Kendall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape|jstor=2245331|journal = Statistical Science|date = 1989-01-01|pages = 87–99|volume = 4|issue = 2|first = David G.|last = Kendall|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012582}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that the central group of Kendall's theories are the finite-dimensional Lie groups, whereas the theories of shape in Computational Anatomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-88-7642-387-1_4|publisher = Scuola Normale Superiore|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9788876423888|pages = 43–53|series = Colloquia |first = David|last = Mumford|editor-first = Umberto|editor-last = Zannier|title = Colloquium de Giorgi 2009|chapter = The geometry and curvature of shape spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |author=Laurent Younes |publisher = Springer|date = 2010-05-25|isbn = 9783642120541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spaces and Manifolds of Shapes in Computer Vision: An Overview |journal = Image Vision Comput.|date = 2012-06-01 |pages = 389–397|volume = 30|issue = 6–7|doi = 10.1016/j.imavis.2011.09.009|first = Laurent|last = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt; have focused on the diffeomorphism group, which to first order via the Jacobian can be thought of as a field–thus infinite dimensional–of low-dimensional Lie groups of scale and rotations. 
[[File:Subcortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space.png|alt=showing man sub-cortical structures|thumb|Figure showing hundreds of sub-cortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space generated from the first two eigenvectors of the empirical co-variance estimated from the population of shapes.]]
The random orbit model provides the natural setting to understand empirical shape and shape statistics within Computational anatomy since the non-linearity of the induced probability law on anatomical shapes and forms 
&lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; is induced via the reduction to the vector fields &lt;math&gt; v_0 \in V &lt;/math&gt; at the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group. The successive flow of the Euler equation induces the random space of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Performing empirical statistics on this tangent space at the identity is the natural way for inducing probability laws on the statistics of shape. Since both the vector fields and the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;Av_0&lt;/math&gt; are in a Hilbert space the natural model is one of a Gaussian random field, so that given test function &lt;math&gt;w \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then the inner-products with the test functions are Gaussian distributed with mean and covariance.

This is depicted in the accompanying figure where sub-cortical brain structures are depicted in a two-dimensional coordinate system based on inner products of their initial vector fields that generate them from the template is shown in a 2-dimensional span of the Hilbert space.

The study of shape and statistics in populations are local theories, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are bijectively mapped. Statistical shape is then the study of diffeomorphic correspondences relative to the template. A core operation is the generation of templates from populations, estimating a shape that is matched to the population. There are several important methods for generating templates including methods based on [[Frechet]] averaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas construction for computational anatomy|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 151–160|volume = 23|first = S.|last = Joshi|first2 = Brad|last2 = Davis|first3 = B.

}}The '''''Computer Underground Digest''''' (CuD) was a weekly online newsletter on early [[Internet]] cultural, social, and legal issues published by Gordon Meyer and Jim Thomas from March 1990 to March 2000.&lt;ref name="fiu"&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/cudisc.html|title = The electronic discourse of the computer underground|publisher = [[Florida International University]]|accessdate=October 5, 2009|author=Steve Mizrach |quote=Gordon Meyer, a sociologist who has since left academia but continues to be involved in the computer industry, wrote in his seminal paper The Social Organization of the Computer Underground that the "computer underground consists of actors in three roles &amp;nbsp; computer hackers, phone phreaks, and software pirates."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Meyer and Thomas were [[Criminal Justice]] professors at [[Northern Illinois University]], and intended the newsletter to cover topical social and legal issues generated during the rise of the [[telecommunications]] and the [[Internet]].  It existed primarily as an email [[mailing list]] and on [[USENET]], though its archives were later provided on a [[website]].  The newsletter came to prominence when it published legal commentary and updates concerning the "[[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] crackdowns" and federal indictments of [[Leonard Rose (hacker)|Leonard Rose]] and [[Craig Neidorf]] of [[Phrack]].

The CuD published commentary from its membership on subjects including the legal and social implications of the growing Internet (and later the [[World Wide Web|web]]), book reviews of topical publications, and many off-topic postings by its readership.  Overtaken by the growth of online forums on the web, it ceased publication in March, 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">In [[biology]], a deme in the strict sense is a group of individuals that belong to the same [[taxonomic group]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt; Gilmour, J. S., &amp; Heslop-Harrison, J. (1955). The deme terminology and the units of micro-evolutionary change. ''Genetica, 27''(1), 147-161.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when biologists, and especially zoologist, use the term ‘deme’ they usually refer to it as the definition of a gamodeme&lt;ref&gt; Winsor, M. P. (2000). Species, Demes, and the Omega Taxonomy: Gilmour and The NewSystematics. ''Biology and Philosophy, 15''(3), 349-388.&lt;/ref&gt;: a local group of individuals (from the same taxon) that interbreed with each other and share a [[gene pool]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The latter definition of a deme is only applicable to [[Sexual reproduction|sexual reproducing]] species, while the former is more neutral and also takes [[Asexual reproduction|asexual reproducing]] species into account, such as certain plant species. In the following sections the latter (and most frequently used) definition of a deme will be used.

In [[evolutionary computation]], a "deme" often refers to any isolated [[subpopulation]] subjected to [[natural selection|selection]] as a unit rather than as individuals.

== Local adaptation ==
A [[population]] of a species usually has multiple demes. Environments between these demes can differ. Demes could, therefore, become [[Local adaptation|locally adapted]] to their environment. A good example of this is the Adaptive Deme Formation (ADF) hypothesis in [[Insect|insects]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt; Zandt, P. A. V., &amp; Mopper, S. (1998). A meta-analysis of adaptive deme formation in phytophagous insect populations. ''The American Naturalist, 152''(4), 595-604.&lt;/ref&gt; The ADF hypothesis states that herbivorous insects can become adapted to specific host plants in their local environment because local plants can have unique nutrient patches to which insects may become adapted. This hypothesis predicts that less mobile insect demes are more likely to become locally adapted than more dispersive insect. However, a [[meta-analysis]], based on 17 studies on this subject, showed that dispersive insect demes were as likely to become locally adapted as less mobile insects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, this study found a small indication that feeding [[Behavior|behaviour]] might stimulate the local adaptation of demes. Endophagous insects were more likely to become locally adapted than exophagous insects. The explanation for this could be that endophagous insects come in more close and continuous contact to the plant’s mechanical, chemical and phenological [[Plant defense against herbivory|defensive mechanisms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Speciation and demes ==
[[Speciation]] could occur at the level of demes. When a deme gets geographically isolated from other demes of the same species, [[Gene flow|gene-flow]] between these demes will stop which could lead to speciation after a long time. This is called [[allopatric speciation]] and is generally a slow process.&lt;ref&gt; Carson, H. L. (1987). The genetic system, the deme, and the origin of species. ''Annual review of genetics, 21''(1), 405-423.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On the contrary, [[sympatric speciation]] can be more rapid when a species has multiple small demes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt; Bush, G. L., Case, S. M., Wilson, A. C., &amp; Patton, J. L. (1977). Rapid speciation and chromosomal evolution in mammals. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 74''(9), 3942-3946.&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid speciation is both observed in plants&lt;ref&gt; Levin, D. A., &amp; Wilson, A. C. (1976). Rates of evolution in seed plants: net increase in diversity of chromosome numbers and species numbers through time. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences, 73''(6), 2086-2090.&lt;/ref&gt; and vertebrates&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Rapid speciation is explained by the [[ecology]] and [[Mating system|social structure]] of demes. Species that behave more territorial, live in patchy environments and/or have a [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] breeding system with only one reproductive male tend to have smaller deme sizes. Interbreeding between small demes is rare due to these factors. Furthermore, [[Allele|alleles]] fixate more rapid in smaller demes. Small demes could, therefore, become genetically distinct from each other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Primate|Primates]], for example, have the second highest speciation rate among mammals, with one speciation event per lineage every 3 million years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, not all primate species have a high speciation rate and this is seen back in there deme size and social structure. Geunons (''[[Guenon|Cercopithecus]]''), for example, live together in small polygynous troops and are a quite diverse [[genus]]. On the other hand, baboons (''[[Baboon|Papio]]'') have a much lower speciation rate. Baboons have larger deme sizes because they live in polygynous multi-male troops. These baboon demes are usually allopatric but gene-flow still exists between demes with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] being common.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Examples==
Various populations of [[gorilla]]s can be understood by their geographical separation and have been assessed to determine distinct and disjointed gene pools.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Beth Taylor and Michele Lynn Goldsmith (2003) ''Gorilla Biology: A Multidisciplinary Perspective'', Cambridge University Press, 508 pages  {{ISBN|0-521-79281-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-79281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[polar bear]], ''Ursus maritimus'', is understood to have 19 identifiable demes, even though their circumpolar distribution allows some interchange among the demes.&lt;ref&gt; C. Michael Hogan (2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205716/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 ''Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

{{other uses|Elongation (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Positional astronomy.svg|thumb|350px|This diagram shows various possible elongations (ε), each of which is the [[angular distance]] between a [[planet]] and the [[Sun]] from Earth's perspective.|alt=An angle ε is drawn between two straight lines from Earth to the Sun, and from Earth to the planet. This is demonstrated for different positions along circular orbits, both for planets closer to the Sun (where the angle is always less than 90°), and for outer planets (for which the angle can range from 0° to 180°), while distinguishing east and west sides.]]

In [[astronomy]], a planet's '''elongation''' is the [[angular separation]] between the [[Sun]] and the planet, with [[Earth]] as the reference point. The greatest elongation of a given [[inferior planet]] occurs when this planet’s position, in its [[orbit]]al path around the Sun, is at [[tangent]] to the observer on Earth. Since an inferior planet is well within the area of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun, observation of its elongation should not pose that much a challenge (compared to [[deep-sky object]]s, for example). When a planet is at its greatest elongation, it appears farthest from the Sun as viewed from Earth, so its apparition is also best at that point.

When an inferior planet is visible after [[sunset]], it is near its '''greatest eastern elongation'''. When an inferior planet is visible before [[sunrise]], it is near its '''greatest western elongation'''. The angle of the maximum elongation (east or west) for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is between 18° and 28°, while that for [[Venus]] is between 45° and 47°. These values vary because the planetary orbits are [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] rather than perfectly [[circular orbit|circular]]. Another factor contributing to this [[orbital eccentricity|inconsistency]] is [[orbital inclination]], in which each planet's [[orbital plane]] is slightly tilted relative to a [[reference plane]], like the [[ecliptic]] and [[invariable plane]]s.

[[ephemeris|Astronomical tables]] and websites, such as [[Heavens-Above]], forecast when and where the planets reach their next maximum elongations.

== Elongation period ==
Greatest elongations of a planet happen periodically, with a greatest eastern elongation followed by a greatest western elongation, and ''vice versa''. The period depends on the relative [[angular velocity]] of Earth and the planet, as seen from the Sun. The time it takes to complete this period is the [[synodic period]] of the planet.

Let ''T'' be the [[period (physics)|period]] (for example the time between two greatest eastern elongations), ''ω'' be the relative [[angular velocity]], ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; Earth's [[angular velocity]] and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; the planet's [[angular velocity]]. Then

:&lt;math&gt;T = {2\pi\over \omega} = {2\pi\over \omega_\mathrm{p} - \omega_\mathrm{e}} = {2\pi\over {2\pi\over T_\mathrm{p}} - {2\pi\over T_\mathrm{e}}}
= {T_\mathrm{e} \over {T_\mathrm{e} \over T_\mathrm{p}} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; are Earth's and the planet's years (i.e. [[period (physics)|period]]s of revolution around the Sun, called [[sidereal period]]s).

For example, [[Venus]]'s year ([[sidereal period]]) is 225 days, and [[Earth]]'s is 365 days. Thus Venus's [[synodic period]], which gives the time between two subsequent eastern (or western) greatest elongations, is 584 days.

These values are approximate, because (as mentioned above) the planets do not have perfectly circular, [[coplanar]] orbits.  When a planet is closer to the Sun it moves faster than when it is further away, so exact determination of the date and time of greatest elongation requires a much more complicated analysis of orbital mechanics.

==Of superior planets==
[[Superior planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s undergo a different cycle. After [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]], such an object's elongation continues to increase until it approaches a maximum value larger than 90° (impossible with inferior planets) and typically very near 180°, which is known as ''[[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]]'' and corresponds to a [[heliocentric]] conjunction with Earth.  In other words, as seen by an observer on the superior planet at opposition, the Earth appears at conjunction with the Sun.  Technically, the exact moment of opposition is slightly different from the moment of maximum elongation.  Opposition is defined as the moment when the apparent [[ecliptic longitude]]s of the superior planet and the Sun differ by 180°, which ignores the fact that the planet is outside the plane of the Earth's orbit.  For example, [[Pluto]], whose orbit is highly inclined to the Earth's orbital plane, can have a maximum elongation significantly less than 180° at opposition.

All superior planets are most easily visible at their oppositions because they are near their closest approach to Earth and are also above the horizon all night. The variation in [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] caused by changes in elongation are greater the closer the planet's orbit is to the Earth's. [[Mars]]' magnitude in particular changes with elongation: it can be as low as +1.8 when in conjunction near aphelion but at a rare favourable opposition it is as high as &amp;minus;2.9, or seventy-five times brighter than its minimum brightness. As one moves further out, the difference in magnitude caused by the difference in elongation gradually fall. The maximum and minimum brightness of [[Jupiter]] differ by only a factor of 3.3 times, whilst those of [[Uranus]] &amp;ndash; which is the most distant Solar System body visible to the [[naked eye]] &amp;ndash; differ by a factor of 1.7 times.

Since asteroids travel in an orbit not much larger than the Earth's, their magnitude can vary greatly depending on elongation. Although more than a dozen objects in the [[asteroid belt]] can be seen with 10x50 [[binoculars]] at an average opposition, only [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] are always above the binocular limit of +9.5 at small elongations.

A [[Quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]] occurs when the position of a body (moon or planet) is such that its elongation is 90° or 270°; i.e. the body-earth-sun angle is 90°

==Of moons of other planets==

Sometimes '''elongation''' may instead refer to the angular distance of a moon of another planet from its central planet, for instance the angular distance of [[Io (moon)|Io]] from [[Jupiter]].  Here we can also talk about ''greatest eastern elongation'' and ''greatest western elongation''.  In the case of the moons of [[Uranus]], one often talks about ''greatest northern elongation'' and ''greatest southern elongation'' instead, due to the very high inclination of Uranus' axis of rotation..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">'''Environmental peacebuilding''' examines and advocates environmental protection and cooperation as a factor in peaceful relations. Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.

==Peacebuilding==

The study of [[peacebuilding]] (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. 1975.  "Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding." In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304. Copenhagen:  Christian Ejlers.&lt;/ref&gt; develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.  Lederach&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul.  Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press) 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly cited, and his work has influenced national aid and development agencies, international agencies, and the network of NGOs that have placed peacebuilding on their agendas.  

Beginning with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promoting An Agenda for Peace in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;UN Secretary-General. 1992. "An Agenda for peace: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping." UN Doc. A/47/277. June 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations adopted the language of peacebuilding and developed programs based on it.  Initiatives promoting human security and human rights share a similar concern with developing an international system that promotes the underlying conditions for the movement towards a peaceful world.

==Environmental peacebuilding==

Within the field of peacebuilding studies and practice, there is a sub-literature on environmental peacebuilding that examines the role of environmental factors in moving towards a sustainable peace.  At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carius, A. (2006). Environmental Peacebuilding: Cooperation as an Instrument of Crisis Prevention and Peacebuilding: Conditions for Success and Constraints. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle, S. (Editor). (2009). From Conflict to Peacebuilding: The Role of Natural Resources and Environment. United Nations Environment Programme. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conca and Wallace&lt;ref&gt;Conca, K., &amp; Wallace, J. (2009). Environment and Peacebuilding in War-torn Societies: Lessons from the UN Environment Programme's Experience with Postconflict Assessment. Global Governance, 15, 4, pp. 185-105.&lt;/ref&gt; note the relationship between environmental peacebuilding projects and studies of environment and conflict.  They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.  

The United Nations Environment Programme has placed environmental conflict and cooperation on its agenda,&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. (2004). Understanding Environment, Conflict, and Cooperation. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted environmental assessments of conflict zones and has recommended&lt;ref&gt;Halle, S. (Editor). (2009). From Conflict to Peacebuilding: The Role of Natural Resources and Environment. United Nations Environment Programme. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; a stronger integration of environmental issues into the work of the UN Peacebuilding Commission.   "Land and Environment" is one of the ten themes of the [http://www.peacebuildingportal.org/index.asp?pgid=3&amp;undb_orgfocus=6 United Nations Peacebuilding Portal.] The University for Peace, sponsored by the United Nations, includes [http://www.upeace.org/academic/masters/ESP.cfm “Environmental Security and Peace”] as one of its eight graduate programs. 

Governmental and civil society organizations have also explored the role of environmental issues in peacebuilding.  The EU sponsored [http://www.initiativeforpeacebuilding.eu/index.php Initiative for Peacebuilding ] has produced a series of [http://www.initiativeforpeacebuilding.eu/publications/index.php?c=2 papers on environmental peacebuilding.] The International Crisis Group includes [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/climate-change-and-conflict.aspx Climate Change and Conflict] as one of its key areas.  In conflict settings, civil society groups have promoted environmental peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Obi, Cyril I. 2005.

==Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==

The 1991 Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the USSR, brought together representatives of the governments of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation within the Jordanian delegation.  The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable 
Middle East peace.    

The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation – not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  

Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Stuart.  2010.  "Environment and Human Security in the Eastern Mediterranean: Regional Environmentalism in the Reframing of Palestinian-Israeli-Jordanian Relations" in P. H. Liotta, David Mouat, Judith Lancaster, Bill Kepner and David Smith, eds. Achieving Environmental Security: Ecosystem Services and Human Welfare. Amsterdam: IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, A. (2008). Regional Water Cooperation and Peacebuilding in the Middle East.  Adelphi Research, Initiative For Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==
===Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information===
[[Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information|IPCRI]] opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.  IPCRI established the Water and Environment division in 1992.  A 1993 edited book presented Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on water cooperation.  Three IPCRI workshops held between 1994-6 on "Our Shared Environment" were followed by three volumes of papers from the workshops.  The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International "Water for Life" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. 

Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the [[trans-boundary river|trans-boundary]] Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.  IPCRI is a partner in the "GLOWA Jordan River" study of the impact of climate change on the Jordan basin, and has undertaken, with the support of the Government of Japan, work designed to provide a model for low cost sanitation to a West Bank village.

===EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East===
[[Friends of the Earth Middle East|EcoPeace / FoEME]] was founded in 1994 as a meeting place for Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli environmental NGOs and became an affiliate of Friends of the Earth in 1998.  FOEME has a wide range of projects – organized around particular geographic areas (the Jordan River valley, the Dead Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba / Eilat), water (Good Water Neighbors, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Conduit, the mountain aquifer, "water, peace and the environment," water privatization), and environmental policy (sustainable development, climate change, "violent conflicts and the environment," trade and environment, solar power and healthy food).  FoEME has promoted protection rather than development of the Dead Sea and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, advocated the establishment of a "peace park" along the Jordan River, and vigorously questioned the proposed mega-project to channel water from the Read Sea to the Dead Sea.  

Since 2001 the FoEME Good Water Neighbors project has been working with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian communities that are mutually dependent on shared water resources.  Each community is partnered with a neighboring community.  Good Water Neighbors works with local community members on water education, awareness and development.  GWN uses dependence on shared water sources as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between partnered communities.

FoEME has published its own study of environmental peacebuilding,&lt;ref&gt;Harari, N., &amp; Roseman, J. (2008).  Environmental Peacebuilding Theory and Practice: A Case Study of the Good Water Neighbours Project and In Depth Analysis of the Wadi Fukin / Tzur Hadassah Communities. EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; and circulates a monthly "environmental peacemaking" listserv.

===Arava Institute for Environmental Studies===
The [[Arava Institute for Environmental Studies|institute]] opened in the 1996-7 academic year.  For one or two semesters students from Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt and overseas live and study together on Kibbutz Ketura (in a remote part of the Negev desert south of the West Bank and just across the valley from Jordan) and receive university credit.&lt;ref&gt;Alleson, Ilan and Stuart Schoenfeld.  2007. 	"Environmental Justice and Peacebuilding in the Middle East," Peace Review 19:371-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolment, which is capped at 45, has varied.  From 1996 to 2010, about 600 students have studied at the institute.  University credit is now received through Ben Gurion University, and the institute co-sponsors a Master's program with Ben Gurion, in which some of its alumni have studied.

The alumni division maintains active Yahoo and Facebook "groups."  Alumni involvement is supplemented by  the Arava Alumni Peace and Environment Network (AAPEN) which held its first meeting in Aqaba in 2005 and has held subsequent meetings and other activities.  The institute has also developed as a research center.  The institute participates in projects as partners with Palestinian and Jordanian researchers and research organizations.  These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.

[[Image:EWIS.jpg|thumb|right|Types of External cromatic 
 wall insulation systems (EWI Systems pictured above)]]

An '''external wall insulation''' system (or EWIS) is a thermally insulated, protective, decorative exterior [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] procedure involving the use of expanded [[polystyrene]], [[mineral wool]], polyurethane foam or phenolic foam, topped off with a reinforced cement based, mineral or synthetic finish and [[plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.maloneassociatesltd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-Risky-Business-of-Covering-Up.pdf|title = The risky business of covering up|last = Malone|first = Joe|date = 1 December 2013|journal = Construction, Research and Innovation Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thickness of thermal insulation is dependent on whatever type is required in order to create a partition with a heat [[transmission factor]] of U=0.25-0.3 W/m2K. When calculating the actual insulation requirements, consideration must be given to current Building Regulation standards. Consideration must also be given to exposure and durability, and whether the structure might be subjected to vandalism etc. In many older properties, special attention is required for concrete beams or lintels which act as [[thermal bridges]] providing poor insulation.

==Types==

External wall insulation systems generally comprise firstly an insulation layer (an element which helps to achieve the requisite thermal performance); and secondly,a protected weatherproof finish (usually a [[Stucco|render]], although brick slips, tiles, and decorative boards can also be used). Insulating render can also be an advantage in certain locations. Choice of types and sizes will depend on the substrate and design exposure requirements.

Dry finishes are usually fixed to the substrate by means of timber [[batten]]s independently fixed to the substrate.

Any system selected and installed, should be certified by a notified body.

===Traditional finishes===

A selection of traditional finishes is currently utilised within the external wall insulation industry. Dry-dash render is a traditional render application commonly used. By this method, dry dashing aggregate is thrown onto the wet render to create a natural aggregate finish. Available in a wide variety of colours, sizes and textures, the practice is relatively cheap. Manufactured aggregates such as ceramics and glass can be used for more specialised projects, but the costs will be greater than for projects using natural aggregates.

Scratch plaster render is a coloured cementitious render scratched while the surface is still workable, but after the initial setting has taken place. The surface of the render is removed by the action of the scratching tool, and approximately {{convert|2|to|3|mm}} of render are removed exposing the open matrix of the aggregate mix. The true colour of the render is exposed with a light even texture.

Rough-cast render consists of a top-coat render and aggregate mix thrown onto a backing coat in a [[slurry]] form, the aggregate being totally encapsulated within the cementitious slurry. The aggregate may be any hard stone of an equal graded size to suit the particular application and creates a “lumpy texture” finish. This method is traditionally widely used in Scotland.

An innovation is the inclusion of [[silicone]] water-proofers in pre-blended and pre-packed proprietary renders. This development increases the specification and capabilities of polymer renders, particularly for exposed or coastal areas. It is applied in the conventional manner and is now readily available in all the usual colours.

Tyrolean finishes are sprayed cementitious mixes, pre-coloured and applied by a hand-held machine. This finish is widely used throughout the UK as an economical, easily applied colourful finish for all forms of building type. It has medium-term durability under average conditions.{{vague|date=May 2011}}

Smooth/painted finishes consist of masonry paint, and are applied to a good rendered surface to give a smooth coloured effect, free of the imperfections that the more natural aggregate finishes can sometimes deliver. A very wide selection of light colours are available.

Textured coatings are applied by roller or trowel to an approximate thickness of {{convert|1.5|to|3|mm}}, and are usually [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] or silicone-based for waterproofing and long term durability. They produce an even, flat-textured, finish.

Acrylic variants are easily applied, and are considered “high performance” finishes. Some cheaper variants might result in the loss [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of surface brightness over a relatively short life span. High quality acrylics can provide a longer term durability, colour stability, and crack resistance compared to polymer cement finishes. Acrylic variants are available in a very wide range of colours.

Silicone variants are more resistant to marine environments than acrylics, as they have superior water resistance, but they can be more costly, and come in a smaller range of colours.

Brick slips are a thin facing applied over an insulant to provide a traditional “brick” wall finish. Slips can either be manufactured by [[extrusion]] or cut from real bricks. Specialist waterproof coloured pointing mortars are used to complete the effect. Commercially available brick slip systems have been developed to include support for the brick slip finish, certified by [[BBA/BRE]]. The brick slips usually have a size of about 210-240 x 50-71 x 20&amp;nbsp;mm (length x height x width).&lt;ref&gt;Klinkerriemchen / The size from Brick slips [http://www.renowall.de/klinkerriemchen.php "Klinkerriemchen / Brick slips"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulated brick renders can also be replicated in coloured polymer to a high standard. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in {{convert|3|to|4|mm}} layers onto a coloured backing. The “brick” pattern is cut into the top layer, exposing an under-layer of differing colour representing the cement joints.

Simulated stone renders are made from coloured [[polymer]]. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in {{convert|3|to|4|mm}} layers onto a specified backing. The “stone” pattern is cut into the top layer exposing an under-layer of differing colour to represent the cement joints.

[[Terracotta]] tiles are usually of clay burnt material imported from Europe. These proprietary systems are secured by a system of extruded aluminium rail systems fixed securely to the substrate with insulation material inserted within the void. Special pressed metal profiles and [[Lock (water transport)#Cill|cills]] are added to make them waterproof.

Timber boards, aluminium or [[PVC]] “sidings” can be installed over insulation to provide additional alternatives to the traditional render and applied finishes. The boards are usually of [[shiplap]] profile, and either [[cedar wood|cedar]] or treated [[softwood]]. Aluminium or PVC systems are also available as alternatives.

Traditional tile hanging finishes can be applied onto conventional timber support structures and insulated with the required type and thickness of insulation. Suitable consideration has to be given to ventilation passages to avoid [[interstitial condensation]].

==Reducing Carbon Emissions==
With the UK aiming to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by the year 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-uk-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-80-by-2050|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British government has offered up to £6,000 cashback to homeowners who install EWI at their solid wall property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Deal: energy saving for your home|url=https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/get-money-back-from-the-green-deal-home-improvement-fund|website=Department of Energy and Climate Change|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Wales, where the housing stock is in particular need of being updated to become energy efficient, has seen a surge in applications for this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dobson|first1=Ben|title=High take up of external wall insulation in Swansea|url=http://www.sbmenergyservices.co.uk/blog/high-take-up-of-external-wall-insulation-in-swansea|website=SBM Energy Services|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External wall insulation is a great and confirmed way to reduce energy usage needed to heat up the building. Installing it is a part of and [[eco home]] or [[carbon neutral home]] idea.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.kanler.com/2015/03/13/going-green-easy-on-the-planet-and-your-wallet/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Requirements==
Particular product requirements need to be met such as the external wall insulation product reaching a particular u-value in order to make the building sufficiently thermally insulated and therefore be used for a green deal project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumasc Exterior Building Products Product Datasheets|url=http://www.alumascfacades.co.uk/downloads/product-datasheets/|website=Alumasc Facades|accessdate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dampness==
The application of External Wall Insulation can help to deal with rain penetration problems through solid walls by blocking wind-driven rain. However, it can also make the problem worse if poor detailing (e.g. around eaves) allows water to pass behind the external wall insulation where it can become trapped. A high standard of design and installation should therefore be insisted upon. The dangers of not adequately designing and specifying these systems is dealt with in a research paper written by Joe Malone and published in the CIOB's Construction, Research and Innovation Journal (Volume 4, Issue 4, Dec 2013 The Risky Business of Covering Up)

External Wall Insulation should only be applied to walls that do not suffer from [[Damp (structural)|pre-existing dampness problems]]. The Energy Saving Trust give the following advice.&lt;ref name="Choosing external wall insulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Insulation/Solid-wall-insulation/Choosing-external-wall-insulation|website=energysavingtrust.org.uk|publisher=Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The main damp issue to be avoided with external wall insulation is rising damp. If you already have a problem with this, then it will have to be fixed before the insulation is fitted, otherwise you run the risk of trapping the damp inside the wall structure and so making the problem worse."''

'''GADV-protein world''' is a hypothetical stage of [[abiogenesis]]. GADV stands for the one letter codes of four [[amino acid]]s, namely, [[glycine]] (G), [[alanine]] (A), [[aspartic acid]] (D) and [[valine]] (V), the main components of GADV [[protein]]s. In the GADV-protein world hypothesis, it is argued that the prebiotic chemistry before the emergence of [[gene]]s involved a stage where GADV-proteins were able to pseudo-replicate. This hypothesis is contrary to the [[RNA world]] hypothesis, which is the most accepted theory of abiogenesis.{{sfn|Ikehara|2005}}

== Description ==
The GADV-protein world hypothesis was first proposed by Kenji Ikehara at [[Nara Women's University]]. It is supported by GNC-SNS primitive gene code hypothesis ([[GNC hypothesis]]) also formulated by him. In the GNC hypothesis, the origin of the present standard [[genetic code]] is considered to be the GNC genetic code that includes the [[codon]]s G[[Guanine|G]]C, G[[Cytosine|C]]C, G[[Adenine|A]]C, G[[Uracil|U]]C, respectively coding [[glycine]], [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], and [[valine]]; it also follows the SNS primitive genetic code that codes ten amino acids, where N denotes arbitrary four [[RNA base]]s and S denotes [[guanine]] (G) and [[cytosine]] (C).

The GADV hypothesis proposes these mechanisms:
* Analysis on present proteins and simulation using chemical factors of amino acid shows GADV-proteins that contains almost the same amount of the four amino acids can form four basic structures of protein, namely, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] structures, [[Alpha helix|α-helices]] and [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]].
* Therefore, GADV-proteins polymerized from randomly chosen amino acids from the four choices, probably becoming globular and water-soluble like some present proteins.
* Proteins generated like this have different [[Protein primary structure|primary structures]], but their simple composition leads to formation of similar spherical and water-soluble proteins that have bulky and hydrophobic valines inside and hydrophilic aspartic acids outside.
* GADV-peptides can polymerize by simple cycles of evaporation and hydration. This gives a rationale for the production of GADV-peptides in [[tide pool]]s on the primitive Earth. Moreover, GADV-peptides randomly polymerized as above have catalytic activity to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] [[peptide bonds]] in bovine [[serum albumin]] and therefore they can catalyze the formation of [[peptide bond]]s as the reverse reaction.
* GADV-proteins can multiply by pseudo-replication in the absence of genes, taking the features above into consideration.

It is related to the [[population genetics]] concept of [[gene flow]], and [[genetic rescue]], which is genetic material intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waller|first=Donald M.|date=June 2015|title=Genetic rescue: a safe or risky bet?|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|issue=11|pages=2595–2597|doi=10.1111/mec.13220|issn=1365-294X|pmid=26013990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is called genetic pollution when it negatively impacts on the fitness of a population, such as through outbreeding depression and the introduction of unwanted phenotypes which can lead to extinction.

Conservation biologists and conservationists have used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into [[wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species]], which they consider undesirable. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced [[invasive species]] that may "''hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution''". In the fields of [[agriculture]], [[agroforestry]] and [[animal husbandry]], ''genetic pollution'' is used to describe gene flows between Genetically engineered species and wild relatives. The use of the word “pollution” is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment, but because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, “pollution” may not always be the most accurate descriptor.

== Gene flow to Wild population ==
{{further|Gene flow}}Some [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] and [[conservationists]] have used genetic pollution for a number of years as a term to describe gene flow from a [[Introduced species|non-native]], [[invasive species|invasive subspecies]], [[Domestication|domestic]], or [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] population to a [[Wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species|indigenous]] population.&lt;ref name="Genetic Pollution in Italian Wolfs 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler_1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Declan|date=18 August 1994|title=Bid to protect wolves from genetic pollution|journal=Nature|volume=370|issue=6490|pages=497|doi=10.1038/370497a0|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potts BM, Barbour RC, Hingston AB, Vaillancourt RE | year = 2003 | title = Corrigendum to: TURNER REVIEW No. 6 ''Genetic pollution of native eucalypt gene pools—identifying the risks'' | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | page = 333 | doi = 10.1071/BT02035_CO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance ===
The introduction of genetic material into the gene pool of a population by human intervention can have both positive and negative effects on populations. When genetic material is intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population, this is called [[genetic rescue]]. When genetic material is unintentionally introduced to a population, this is called genetic pollution and can negatively affect the fitness of a population (primarily through [[outbreeding depression]]), introduce other unwanted phenotypes, or theoretically lead to extinction.

=== Introduced species ===
{{further|Introduced species}}An introduced species is one that is not native to a given population that is either intentionally or accidentally brought into a given ecosystem. Effects of introduction are highly variable, but if an introduced species has a major negative impact on its new environment, it can be considered an invasive species. One such example is the introduction of the Asian Longhorned beetle in North America, which was first detected in 1996 in Brooklyn, New York. It is believed that these beetles were introduced through cargo at trade ports. The beetles are highly damaging to the environment, and are estimated to cause risk to 35% of urban trees, excluding natural forests.&lt;ref&gt;Haack, Robert A., et al. Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective. vol. 55, Annual Review of Entomology, 2010, Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; These beetles cause severe damage to the wood of trees by larval funneling. Their presence in the ecosystem destabilizes community structure, having a negative influence on many species in the system. Introduced species are not always disruptive to an environment, however. Tomás Carlo and Jason Gleditch of Penn State University found that the number of invasive honeysuckle plants in the area correlated with the number and diversity of the birds in the Happy Valley Region of Pennsylvania, suggesting introduced honeysuckle plants and birds formed a mutually beneficial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''2011, Invasive Plants Can Create Positive Ecological Change.''&lt;/ref&gt; Presence of introduced honeysuckle was associated with higher diversity of the bird populations in that area, demonstrating that introduced species are not always detrimental to a given environment and it is completely context dependent.

==== Invasive species ====
Conservation biologists and conservationists have, for a number of years, used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into [[wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species]], which they consider undesirable.&lt;ref name="Genetic Pollution in Italian Wolfs 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Butler_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt;  For example, [[TRAFFIC]] is the international [[wildlife]] trade monitoring network that works to limit [[trade]] in wild plants and animals so that it is not a threat to conservationist goals. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced [[invasive species]] that may "''hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution''".&lt;ref name="TRAFFIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/wildlife/wild6.htm|title=When is wildlife trade a problem?|website=TRAFFIC.org, the wildlife trade monitoring network, a joint programme of WWF and IUCN|publisher=The World Conservation Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224231437/http://www.traffic.org/wildlife/wild6.htm|archive-date=24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]], the statutory adviser to the [[Government of United Kingdom|UK government]], has stated that invasive species "will alter the genetic pool (a process called ''genetic pollution''), which is an irreversible change."&lt;ref name="JNCC"&gt;[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1532 Effects of the introduction of invasive/non-native species] - ''Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)'', a statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation. Accessed on November 25, 2007.

: "''Occasionally non-native species can reproduce with native species and produce hybrids, which will alter the genetic pool (a process called ''genetic pollution''), which is an irreversible change.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Invasive species can invade both large and small native populations and have a profound effect. Upon invasion, invasive species interbreed with native species to form sterile or more evolutionarily fit hybrids that can outcompete the native populations. Invasive species can cause extinctions of small populations on islands that are particularly vulnerable due to their smaller amounts of genetic diversity. In these populations, local adaptations can be disrupted by the introduction of new genes that may not be as suitable for the small island environments. For example, the ''Cercocarpus traskiae'' of the Catalina Island off the coast of California has faced near extinction with only a single population remaining due to the hybridization of its offspring with ''Cercocarpus betuloides.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Donald A.|last2=Francisco-Ortega|first2=Javier|last3=Jansen|first3=Robert K. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1996-02-01|title=Hybridization and the Extinction of Rare Plant Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=10–16|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010010.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic populations ===
Increased contact between wild and [[Domestication|domesticated]] populations of organisms can lead to reproductive interactions that are detrimental to the wild population's ability to survive. A wild population is one that lives in natural areas and is not regularly looked after by humans. This contrast with domesticated populations that live in human controlled areas and are regularly, and historically, in contact with humans. [[Gene]]s from domesticated populations are added to wild populations as a result of reproduction. In many crop populations this can be the result of pollen traveling from farmed crops to neighboring wild plants of the same species. For farmed animals, this reproduction may happen as the result of escaped or released animals.

==== Aquaculture ====
[[Aquaculture]] is the practice of farming aquatic animals or plants for the purpose of consumption. This practice is becoming increasingly common for the production of [[salmon]]. This is specifically termed [[Aquaculture of salmonids|aquaculture of salmonoids]]. One of the dangers of this practice is the possibility of domesticated salmon breaking free from their containment. The occurrence of escaping incidents is becoming increasingly common as aquaculture gains popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-atlantic-salmon-20170903-story.html|title=More than 160,000 non-native Atlantic salmon escaped into Washington waters in fish farm accident|last=Anderson|first=Rick | name-list-format = vanc |website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/24/545619525/environmental-nightmare-after-thousands-of-atlantic-salmon-escape-fish-farm|title='Environmental Nightmare' After Thousands Of Atlantic Salmon Escape Fish Farm|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://beta.nydailynews.com/news/national/thousands-salmon-escaped-fish-farm-no-article-1.3439097|title=Thousands of salmon escape from fish farm, and no one knows what will happen next|last=Scotti|first=Ariel | name-list-format = vanc |work=nydailynews.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming structures may be ineffective at holding the vast number of fast growing animals they house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livingoceans.org/initiatives/salmon-farming/issues/escapes-net-pens-are-poor-containment-structures-and-escaped|title=Escapes: Net-pens are poor containment structures and escaped farmed salmon can compete with wild salmon for food and spawning habitat|date=2013-03-12|work=Living Oceans|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural disasters, high tides, and other environmental occurrences can also trigger aquatic animal escapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2017/08/24/how-did-the-eclipse-let-thousands-of-farmed-salmon-escape/#1ea0f1d8633e|title=How Did The Eclipse Let Thousands Of Farmed Salmon Escape?|last=Montanari|first=Shaena | name-list-format = vanc |work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/fish-spill-bigger-than-initial-estimates-farm-destroyed/|title=Spill of farmed Atlantic salmon near San Juan Islands much bigger than first estimates|date=2017-08-24|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason these escapes are considered dangers is the impact they pose for the wild population they reproduce with after escaping.

==== Crops ====
[[Crop]]s refer to groups of plants grown for consumption. Despite domestication over many years, these plants are not so far removed from their wild relatives that they could reproduce if brought together. Many crops are still grown in the areas they originated and gene flow between crops and wild relatives impacts the evolution of wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellstrand|first=Norman C.|last2=Prentice|first2=Honor C.|last3=Hancock|first3=James F.|date=1999|title=Gene Flow and Introgression from Domesticated Plants into Their Wild Relatives|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=30|issue=1|pages=539–563|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.30.1.539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers can avoid reproduction between the different populations by timing their planting of crops so that crops are not flowering when wild relatives would be. Domesticated crops have been changed through artificial selection and genetic engineering. The genetic make up of many crops is different than that of its wild relatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html|title=Tracking the Ancestry of Corn Back 9,000 Years|last=Carroll|first=Sean B.|date=2010-05-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the closer they grow to one another the more likely they are to share genes through pollen. Gene flow persists between crops and wild counterparts.

=== Genetically engineered organisms ===
{{see|Genetic engineering}}

Genetically engineered organisms are genetically modified in a laboratory, and therefore distinct from those that were bred through artificial selection. In the fields of [[agriculture]], [[agroforestry]] and [[animal husbandry]], ''genetic pollution'' is being used to describe gene flows between GE species and wild relatives.&lt;ref name="FAO_document1"/&gt;
An early use of the term "''genetic pollution"'' in this later sense appears in a wide-ranging review of the potential ecological effects of genetic engineering in [http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/6481/3/8?dps= The Ecologist magazine in July 1989]. It was also popularized by environmentalist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] in his 1998 book ''The Biotech Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jeremy | last = Rifkin | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | title = The Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World | publisher = J P Tarcher | isbn = 978-0-87477-909-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While intentional crossbreeding between two genetically distinct varieties is described as [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with the subsequent [[introgression]] of genes, Rifkin, who had played a leading role in the ethical debate for over a decade before, used genetic pollution to describe what he considered to be problems that might occur due the unintentional process of (modernly) [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) dispersing their genes into the natural environment by breeding with wild plants or animals.&lt;ref name="FAO_document1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-forum/conference-7/en/ | title = Gene flow from GM to non-GM populations in the crop, forestry, animal and fishery sectors | website = Background document to Conference 7: May 31 - July 6, 2002; Electronic Forum on Biotechnology in Food and Agriculture | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldWideWords_MichaelQuinion"&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Quinion | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-gen1.htm | title = Genetic Pollution | website = World Wide Words }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Amy | last = Otchet | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | url = http://www.unesco.org/courier/1998_09/uk/dires/txt1.htm | title = Jeremy Rifkin: fears of a brave new world | website = an interview hosted by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about negative consequences from gene flow between genetically engineered organisms and wild populations are valid. Most corn and soybean crops grown in the midwestern USA are genetically modified. There are corn and soybean varieties that are resistant to herbicides like glyphosate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Emily|date=2010-06|title=Glyphosate resistance threatens Roundup hegemony|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0610-537|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=28|issue=6|pages=537–538|doi=10.1038/nbt0610-537|pmid=20531318|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corn that produces [[neonicotinoid]] pesticide within all of its tissues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krupke|first=C.

Many farmed crops may be weed resistant and reproduce with wild relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jul/25/gm.food|title=GM crops created superweed, say scientists|last=Brown|first=Paul|date=2005-07-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is necessary to understand how much gene flow between genetically engineered crops and wild populations occurs, and the impacts of genetic mixing.

==== Mutated organisms ====
Mutations within organisms can be executed through the process of exposing the organism to chemicals or radiation in order to generate mutations.  This has been done in plants in order to create mutants that have a desired trait.  These mutants can then be bred with other mutants or individuals that are not mutated in order to maintain the mutant trait.  However, similar to the risks associated with introducing individuals to a certain environment, the variation created by mutated individuals could have a negative impact on native populations as well.
{{further|Mutation breeding}}

====Preventative measures====

Since 2005 there has existed a [[GM Contamination Register]], launched for [[GeneWatch]] UK and [[Greenpeace]] International that records all incidents of intentional or accidental&lt;ref name="2001may11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/geneng/2001may11.html|title=Illegal Genetically Engineered Corn from Monsanto Detected in Argentina|website=GM Contamination Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622031622/http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/geneng/2001may11.html|archive-date=2011-06-22|deadurl=yes|access-date=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmcontaminationregister.org/index.php?content=re_detail&amp;gw_id=131&amp;reg=cou.13&amp;inc=0&amp;con=0&amp;cof=0&amp;year=0&amp;handle2_page=  | title = Brazil – Illegal Roundup Ready cotton grown on 16,000 hectares | website = GM Contamination Register }}&lt;/ref&gt; release of organisms genetically modified using modern techniques.&lt;ref name="gmcontaminationregister.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcontaminationregister.org/|title=GM Contamination Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic Use Restriction Technologies|Genetic use restriction technologies]] (GURTs) were developed for the purpose of property protection, but could be beneficial in preventing the dispersal of transgenes. GeneSafe technologies introduced a method that became known as “Terminator.” This method is based on seeds that produce sterile plants. This would prevent movement of transgenes into wild populations as hybridization would not be possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sang|first=Yi|last2=Millwood|first2=Reginald J.|last3=Neal Stewart Jr|first3=C.|date=2013-06-04|title=Gene use restriction technologies for transgenic plant bioconfinement|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=649–658|doi=10.1111/pbi.12084|pmid=23730743|issn=1467-7644}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this technology has never been deployed as it disproportionately negatively affects farmers in developing countries, who save seeds to use each year (whereas in developed countries, farmers generally buy seeds from seed production companies).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Physical containment has also been utilized to prevent the escape of transgenes. Physical containment includes barriers such as filters in labs, screens in greenhouses, and isolation distances in the field. Isolation distances have not always been successful, such as transgene escape from an isolated field into the wild in herbicide-resistant bentgrass ''Agrostis stolonifera''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gressel|first=Jonathan|date=2014-08-15|title=Dealing with transgene flow of crop protection traits from crops to their relatives|journal=Pest Management Science|language=en|volume=71|issue=5|pages=658–667|doi=10.1002/ps.3850|pmid=24977384|issn=1526-498X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggested method that applies specifically to protection traits (e.g. pathogen resistance) is mitigation. Mitigation involves linking the positive trait (beneficial to fitness) to a trait that is negative (harmful to fitness) to wild but not domesticated individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this case, if the protection trait was introduced to a weed, the negative trait would also be introduced in order to decrease overall fitness of the weed and decrease possibility of the individual’s reproduction and thus propagation of the transgene.

====Risks====

Not all genetically engineered organisms cause genetic pollution.  Genetic engineering has a variety of uses and is specifically defined as a direct manipulation of the genome of an organism.  Genetic pollution can occur in response to the introduction of a species that is not native to a particular environment, and genetically engineered organisms are examples of individuals that could cause genetic pollution following introduction.  Due to these risks, studies have been done in order to assess the risks of genetic pollution associated with organisms that have been genetically engineered:
&lt;!--why do we need a list here? better as text, but doubt if it's appropriate to list studies anyway--&gt;

Not only are there risks in terms of genetic engineering, but there are risks that emerge from species hybridization In Czechoslovakia, ibex were introduced from Turkey and Sinai to help promote the ibex population there, which caused hybrids that produced offspring too early, which caused the overall population to disappear completely.&lt;ref&gt;''Genetic Rescue: a Safe or Risky Bet?''&lt;/ref&gt; The genes of each population of the ibex in Turkey and Sinai were locally adapted to their environments so when placed in a new environmental context did not flourish. Additionally, the environmental toll that may arise from the introduction of a new species may be so disruptive that the ecosystem is no longer able to sustain certain populations.

== Controversy ==

=== Environmentalist perspectives  ===
The use of the word “pollution” in the term genetic pollution has a deliberate negative connotation and is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment. However, because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, “pollution” may not be the most accurate descriptor.

=== Governmental definition  ===
From a governmental perspective, genetic pollution is defined as follows by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Uncontrolled spread of genetic information (frequently referring to transgenes) into the genomes of organisms in which such genes are not present in nature."&lt;ref name="Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture - A Revised and Augmented Edition of the Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-glossary/en/|title=Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture - A Revised and Augmented Edition of the Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering|date=26 October 2007|series=A FAO Research and Technology Paper|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-104683-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026141019/http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-glossary/en/|archive-date=30 November 2011|vauthors=Zaid A, Hughes HG, Porceddu E, Nicholas F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Scientific perspectives ===
Use of the term 'genetic pollution' and similar phrases such as ''genetic deterioration'', ''genetic swamping'', ''genetic takeover'', and ''genetic aggression'', are being debated by scientists as many do not find it scientifically appropriate. Rhymer and Simberloff argue that these types of terms: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...imply either that hybrids are less fit than the parentals, which need not be the case, or that there is an inherent value in "pure" gene pools.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-mixing-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;They recommend that gene flow from invasive species be termed '''genetic mixing''' since:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mixing" need not be value-laden, and we use it here to denote mixing of gene pools whether or not associated with a decline in fitness.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-mixing-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;Environmentalists such as [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]], an ex-member and cofounder of [[Greenpeace]], questions if the term genetic pollution is more political than scientific. The term is considered to arouse emotional feelings towards the subject matter.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-Say no to genetic pollution-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] In an interview he comments:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you take a term used quite frequently these days, the term "genetic pollution," otherwise referred to as genetic contamination, it is a propaganda term, not a technical or scientific term. Pollution and contamination are both [[value judgment]]s. By using the word "genetic" it gives the public the impression that they are talking about something scientific or technical--as if there were such a thing as genes that amount to pollution.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-heartland-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, using the term “genetic pollution” is inherently political. A scientific approach to discussing gene flow between introduced and native species would be to use terms like genetic mixing or gene flow. Such mixing can definitely have negative consequences on the fitness of native populations, so it is important not to minimize the risk. However, because genetic mixing can also lead to fitness recovery in cases that could be described as “genetic rescue”, it is important to distinguish that just mixing genes from introduced into native populations can lead to variable outcomes for the fitness of native populations.

{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}

'''Girl power''' is a [[slogan]] that encourages and celebrates [[women's empowerment]], independence, and confidence. The slogan's invention is credited to  US punk band [[Bikini Kill]], who published a [[zine]] called ''Girl Power'' in 1991.

== Early usage and origins==
[[File:Girl Power zine.jpg|thumb|left|158px|''Girl Power'' (1991), a [[zine]] that introduced the slogan to the punk lexicon.]]
[[File:01-21-2017 - Women's March on NYC (10696).jpg|thumb|Girls wearing "Girl power" sashes at the [[2017 Women's March]] in New York City]]

In 1991, US punk band [[Bikini Kill]] published a feminist [[zine]] called ''Girl Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/music/kathleen-hanna-julie-ruin-hit-reset-interview.html |title=Kathleen Hanna on ''Hit Reset'', Her Recovery and Her Feminist Path |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=July 11, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's lead singer, [[Kathleen Hanna]], said was inspired by the [[Black Power]] slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Sara|title=Girls to the Front|date=2010|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term became popular in the early and mid 90s punk culture. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' credits the zine with coining the slogan: "In their feminist fanzine Bikini Kill they articulated an agenda for young women in and outside of music; the band put those ideas to practice. (Ironically, the zine first coined the "girl power" slogan, later co-opted by England's [[bubblegum pop]] band the [[Spice Girls]].) Bikini Kill earned a reputation in the punk underground for confronting certain standards of that genre; for example, asking people to slam at the side of the stage, so that women would not get pushed out of the front, and inviting women to take the mike and talk about sexual abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography |title=Bikini Kill Bio |website=RollingStone.com |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is sometimes [[Sensational spelling|sensationally spelled]] ''grrrl power'', based on the spelling of ''[[riot grrrl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonick|first=Marnina|title=Girl Culture|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.

Some other musical artists who have used the slogan in their music are Welsh band [[Helen Love]], with it appearing in the chorus of their 1992 song “Formula One Racing Girls”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |title=Helen Love - Gabba Gabba We Accept You |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114007/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk duo [[Shampoo (band)|Shampoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/april_2001/shampoo.html |title=Shampoo - Interview by Alexander Laurence |publisher=Free Williamsburg |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who released an album and single titled ''Girl Power'' in 1995.

== Spice Girls and scholarship ==
British pop quintet [[Spice Girls]] popularized the slogan in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/from-title-ix-to-riot-gr.html  |title=From Title IX to Riot Grrrls |publisher=Harvard Magazine |date=January–February 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/38786.stm |title=Girl power &amp;#124; You've come a long way baby |publisher=BBC News |date=December 30, 1997 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarler, Carol |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-396834/Girl-Power-betrayed-us.html |title=Girl Power: how it betrayed us |publisher=Daily Mail |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2002 book ''[[Girl Heroes|Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture]]'', Professor Susan Hopkins suggests a correlation between ''girl power'', Spice Girls, and [[Action hero#Female action heroes|female action heroes]] at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Costi, Angela |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/22/power_chicks/ |title=Super Slick Power Chicks: The New Force or Elaborate Parody? |publisher=Senses of Cinema |date=October 4, 2002 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geri Halliwell]], a member of the Spice Girls, credited former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], a leading conservative, as the pioneer of their ideology of girl power.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Evans and Tara Brabazon, "I'll never be your woman: the Spice Girls and new flavours of feminism." ''Social Alternatives'' 17#2 (1998): 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/spice-girls-too-hot-to-handle-19970710 |title=Spice Girls: Too Hot to Handle |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=10 July 1997 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan has also been examined within the context of the academic field, for example [[Buffy studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm "The Third Wave's Final girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620082403/http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm |date=June 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media theorist Kathleen Rowe Karlyn in her article "Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karlyn |first=Kathleen Rowe |url=http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |title=Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother |publisher=Genders |year=2003 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612004031/http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irene Karras in "The Third Wave's [[Final girl]]: [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]" suggest a link with [[third-wave feminism]]. Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in the introduction to ''Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors'', discuss what they describe as a link between girl power and a [[List of women warriors in literature and popular culture|"new" image of women warriors]] in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riley |first=Robin |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 |title=Review of Early, Frances; Kennedy, Kathleen, eds., Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors |publisher=H-Net Reviews |date=May 2004 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Oxford English Dictionary''===
A 2001 update to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined ''girl power'' as:

{{quote|Power exercised girls; spec. a self-reliant attitude among girls and young women manifested in ambition, assertiveness, and individualism. Although also used more widely (esp. as a slogan), the term has been particularly and repeatedly associated with popular music; most notably in the early 1990s with the briefly prominent "riot grrrl" movement in the United States (cf. RIOT GIRL n.); then, in the late 1990s, with the British all-female group The Spice Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00307048?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=girl+power&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=OED:Girl power |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dictionary further offers an example of this term by quoting from "Angel Delight", an article in the March 24, 2001 issue of ''Dreamwatch'' about the television series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'':

{{quote|After the [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connors]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]s of the 1980s, the 1990s weren't so kind to the superwoman format&amp;mdash;[[Xena]] Warrior Princess excepted. But it's a new 2000 millennium now, and while ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' are kicking up a storm on movie screens, it's been down to [[James Cameron]] to bring empowered female warriors back to television screens. And tellingly, Cameron has done it by mixing the sober feminism of his ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' characters with the sexed-up girl power of a [[Britney Spears]] concert. The result is ''Dark Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml E y e s &lt;-&gt; &lt;-&gt; O n l y&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105035505/http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml |date=2008-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism===
Dr. Debbie Ging, Chair of the BA in Communications Studies in [[Dublin City University]], was critical of the "Girl power" ideals, and linked it to the sexualisation of younger children, girls in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Ging, Debbie. [http://webpages.dcu.ie/~gingd/pdf/SexualisationOfChildren.pdf "''Girl Power" doesn’t empower: why it’s time for an honest debate about the sexualisation of children in Ireland''] July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Amy McClure of [[North Carolina State University]] warns against placing too much hope on girl power as an empowering concept. She says, “An ideology based on [[consumerism]] can never be a revolutionary social movement. The fact that it appears to be a revolutionary movement is a dangerous lie that not only marketers sell to us but that we often happily sell to ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131183249/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html |date=January 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Media can sometimes present a narrow definition of what it means to be a girl today. One common example being popular toys such Mattel's [[Barbie]]. The recent “I can be” Barbie&lt;ref&gt;http://icanbe.barbie.com&lt;/ref&gt; embodies this concept of “girl power”: that little girls can be anything they want when they grow up. Arguably, Barbie's image may also present narrowed options with which girls can identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lamb | first1 = Sharon | last2 = Brown | first2 = Lyn Mikel | authorlink1 = Sharon Lamb |authorlink2=Lyn Mikel Brown| title = Packaging Girlhood: rescuing our daughters from marketers' schemes | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780312370053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Jane Parkinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the term as something "young women [that] are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality" hide behind and denounced it for including the word "girl", claiming it promoted the calling of adult women as girls.&lt;ref name="tgljaja"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/08/stop-calling-women-girls-its-either-patronising-or-sexually-suggestive | title=Stop calling women 'girls'.

'''[[Green building]]''' results in structures that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout their lifecycle – from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igreenbuild.com/cd_1967.aspx |title=GreenBuild.com |publisher=Igreenbuild.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2009 report by the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] evaluated 12 sustainably designed GSA buildings, and found they cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were more satisfied with the overall building than those in typical commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalmarketspartnership.com/UserFiles/Admin%20GSA%20June%202008%20-%20Assessing%20Green%20Building%20Performance.pdf |title=GSA Public Buildings Service Assessing Green Building Performance A Post-Occupancy Evaluation of 12 GSA Buildings |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wood products]]''' from responsible sources are a good choice for most green building projects – both new construction and renovations. Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun, is renewable, sustainable and recyclable. It is an effective insulator and uses far less energy to produce than concrete or steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx WoodWorks Sustainable Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818041504/http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx |date=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can also mitigate climate change because wood products continue to store carbon absorbed by the tree during its growing cycle, and because substituting wood for fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete result in ‘avoided’ greenhouse gas emissions. 

Wood’s natural beauty and warmth have been shown to generate improved productivity and performance in schools, offices and better patient outcomes in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694 |title=McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems |publisher=Continuingeducation.construction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle assessment==

A [[life cycle assessment]] can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing each and every impact associated with all the stages of a process from cradle-to-grave (i.e., from raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling).

A comprehensive review of scientific literature from Europe, North America and Australia pertaining to life cycle assessment of wood products &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/dcvr/ctrl?action=shwart&amp;aix=3&amp;aid=7314557 |title=Abstract Wooden building products in comparative LCA 2007 |publisher=Discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, among other things, that:
* Fossil fuel consumption, the potential contributions to the greenhouse effect and the quantities of solid waste tend to be minor for wood products compared to competing products.
* Wood products that have been installed and are used in an appropriate way tend to have a favourable environmental profile compared to functionally equivalent products out of other materials.

A study by the [[Canadian Wood Council]] compared the life cycle impacts of three {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} homes designed primarily in wood, steel and concrete over the first 20 years of their lifespans. Relative to the wood design, the steel and concrete designs released more air pollution, produced more solid wastes, used more resources, required more energy, emitted more greenhouse gases and discharged more water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN Canadian Wood Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312112233/http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN |date=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the complete life cycle is considered, including use and disposal, the great majority of the studies indicate that wood products have lower greenhouse gas emissions. In the few cases where wood products cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than their non-wood counterparts, the cause was inappropriate post-use disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools are available that enable architects to judge the relative environmental merits of building materials. They include the [[ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/impactEstimator/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute Impact Estimator for Buildings |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is capable of modeling 95% of the building stock in North America, and the ATHENA® EcoCalculator for Assemblies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html ATHENA Institute EcoCalculator for Assemblies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014164446/http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html |date=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides instant life cycle assessment results for common assemblies based on detailed assessments previously conducted using the Estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/about/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EcoCalculator is available free from the non-profit [http://www.athenasmi.org Athena Sustainable Materials Institute] in order to encourage greater use of LCA by design and building professionals.

==Wood and climate change==

As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass (wood, leaves, roots). When trees decompose or burn, much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide, and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Header/tackle-climate-change.pdf |title=Tackle Climate Change, Use Wood |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a tree is cut and the wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture, the carbon is stored for decades or longer. A typical {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in North America contains 29 metric tonnes of carbon, or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years (about 12,500 litres of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpinnovations.ca/ |title=FPInnovations Wood and Climate Change |publisher=Fpinnovations.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
 
When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"/&gt;

Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime than other major building materials. Substituting a cubic metre of blocks or brick with wood results in a significant saving of 0.75 to one tone of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/rome2007/docs/Using_wood_products_to_mitigate_climate_change.pdf |title=Using Wood Products to Mitigate Climate Change Page 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Increasing the use of wood products in construction and for other long-lived uses, plus the use of wood byproducts and wood waste as biomass replacement for fossil fuels, can contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas stabilization. The sustainable management of forests for the production of wood products is a feasible and beneficial part of an overall strategy to mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Securing the Future]], a United Kingdom government strategy for sustainable development, stated: “Forestry practices can make a significant contribution by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the national forest estate, by burning wood for fuel, and by using wood as a substitute for energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel.”

==The role of wood in carbon balances==

[[FPInnovations]], a Canadian non-profit research organization, conducted a literature review of 66 scientific peer-reviewed articles regarding the net impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases due to wood product use within a life cycle perspective. It showed several ways wood product substitution affects greenhouse gas balances, including:

* Less fossil fuel consumption in manufacturing;
* Avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions from cement manufacturing when wood products replace cement-based products;
* Carbon storage in wood products and in the forest; and
* Avoided fossil fuel emissions when wood biofuels replace fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 3 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==

As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete or steel.

A recent case study of the Eugene Kruger Building in Quebec, Canada determined that the all-wood solution adopted for this 8,000-square-metre academic building resulted in a 40% reduction in embodied energy compared to steel and concrete alternatives.

A 2002 study compared production energy values for building components (e.g. walls, floors, roofs) made predominantly of wood, steel and concrete, and found that wood construction has a range of energy use from 185 to 280 Gigajoules (GJ), concrete from 265 to 521 GJ, and steel from 457 to 649 GJ. Wood construction will generally use less energy than other materials, although the high end of the range of wood construction energy overlaps with the low end of the range of concrete construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 42 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Passive design]] uses natural processes – convection, absorption, radiation, and conduction – to minimize energy consumption and improve thermal comfort. Researchers in Europe have identified wood as a suitable material in the development of passive buildings due to its unique combination of properties, including thermal resistance, natural finish, structural integrity, light weight and weatherproof qualities. Passive design is beginning to be incorporated in small buildings in North America through the use of structural wood panels.
 
Due to its cellular structure and lots of tiny air pockets, wood is a better natural insulator in most climates – 400 times better than steel and 10 times better than concrete. More insulation is needed for steel and concrete to achieve the same thermal performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-3_Energy_Conservation.pdf |title=Naturally:wood Green Building Toolkit Module 3 Energy Conservation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2002 study prepared by the [[National Association of Home Builders]] Research Center Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/15/14083.pdf |title=NAHB Research Center Inc. Steel vs. Wood: Long-Term Thermal Performance Comparison 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared long-term energy use in two nearly identical side-by-side homes, one framed with conventional dimensional lumber and the second framed with cold-formed steel. It found the steel-framed house used 3.9% more natural gas in the winter and 10.7% more electricity in the summer.

==Health and well-being==

Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. 

Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/resources |title=Naturally:wood Green Building with Wood Toolkit |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/28644 |title=Wood in the Human Environment: Restorative Properties of Wood in the Build Indoor Environment Fell, David Robert |publisher=Circle.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the visual presence of wood in a room lowers [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) activation in occupants, further establishing the positive link between wood and human health. SNS activation is the way human bodies prepare themselves to deal with stress. It increases blood pressure and heart rate while inhibiting digestion, recovery and repair functions in order to deal with immediate threats. While necessary in the short term, prolonged periods in an SNS-activated state have a negative effect on the body’s physiological and psychological health.

The study supports wood’s value as a tool in [[evidence-based design]] (EBD) – a growing field that seeks to promote health and other positive outcomes such as increased productivity and well-being based on scientifically credible evidence. So far, EBD has focused largely on healthcare and, in particular, patient recovery.

==Reducing waste==

Green building seeks to avoid wasting energy, water and materials during construction. Design and building professionals can reduce construction waste through design optimization, using right-sized framing members, for example, or pre-manufactured and engineered components.

The wood industry reduces waste in a similar way by optimizing sawmill operations and by using wood chips and sawdust to produce paper and composite products, or as fuel for renewable bioenergy. North American wood producers use 98 percent of every tree harvested and brought to a mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/Green_Bldg.pdf |title=Wood and Green Building |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than demolishing structures at the end of their useful life, they are deconstructed to reclaim useful building materials rather than dumping them in the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html In Business magazine Green Builders Get Big Help from Deconstruction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092246/http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When used properly, wood, concrete and steel can last for decades or centuries. In North America, most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values. Designing for flexibility and adaptability secures the greatest value for the [[embodied energy]] in building materials. 

Wood is versatile and flexible, making it the easiest construction material for renovations. Wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs, whether this involves adding a new room or moving a window or door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/why-wood |title=Naturally:wood |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood structures are typically easy to adapt to new uses because the material is so light and easy to work with. Few homeowner or professional remodelers have the skill and equipment needed to alter steel-frame structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.ca/Resources/Tips/#Q18 |title=Canadian Wood Council |publisher=Cwc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural wood members can typically be reclaimed and reused for the same or similar purpose with only minor modifications or wastage, or remilled and fashioned into alternate products such as window and door frames.
To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, the CO2 Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling.

==Responsible sourcing==

Wood is a responsible environmental choice for construction as long as it comes from forests that are managed sustainably. [[Illegal logging]] and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major problem for many timber-producing countries in the developing world. It causes environmental damage, costs governments billions of dollars in lost revenue, promotes corruption, undermines the rule of law and good governance and funds armed conflict. Consumer countries can use their buying power by ensuring the wood products they buy are from known and legal sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/ |title=Illegal-Logging.info |publisher=Illegal-Logging.info |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation, which is the permanent removal of forests where the land is converted to other uses such as agriculture or housing, is also a significant problem in developing countries, and globally accounts for 17% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. 

The forests most vulnerable to destruction are in tropical regions of the world, where the rate of deforestation was estimated at {{convert|32000000|acre|km2}} a year from 1990 to 2005. According to the State of the World’s Forests Report, 2007, “the world lost about 3 percent of its forest area from 1990 to 2005; but, in North America, the total forest area remained virtually constant.” When forest land is converted for other uses, a portion of the deforestation can be offset by afforestation—such as the planting of trees on land that has been bare of trees for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcclimatechange.org/ Tackle Climate Change – Use Wood book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0773e/a0773e00.HTM |title=State of the World’s Forests, 2007 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary third-party forest certification is a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.&lt;ref name="metafore1"&gt;{{cite web|author=GreenBlue |url=http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 |title=Metafore |publisher=Metafore |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. This certification verifies that forests are well-managed – as defined by a particular standard – and ensures that certified wood and paper products come from legal and responsible sources.&lt;ref name="metafore1"/&gt;

==Green building rating systems==

A 2010 study by the [[Light House Sustainable Building Centre]] in British Columbia, Canada examined the ways in which the world’s major voluntary green building rating systems incorporate wood. It found that rating systems for single family homes in North America were the most inclusive of wood products and rating systems for commercial buildings and buildings outside of North America were the least inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
Systems studied included [[BREEAM]] (United Kingdom), Built Green (United States and Canada), CASBEE (Japan), [[Green Globes]] (United States), [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] (Australia), [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (launched in United States and used in countries such as Canada, China, India and Mexico), [[Living Building Challenge]] (United States and Canada), the [[NAHB – National Green Building Program]] (United States), and the SB Tool (Canada and UK). 

In most cases, the rating systems offer credits/point for the use of wood in the following areas: certified wood; recycled /reused /salvaged materials; and local sourcing of materials. In some cases, building techniques and skills (such as advanced framing) and waste minimalization are recognized, and most demand that all wood adhesives, resins, engineered and composite products contain no added [[urea formaldehyde]] and have strict limits on VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) content.

==LEED certified wood credit==
{{see also|Certified wood}}

In December 2010, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] failed to get enough yes votes from members for a proposed rewrite of the certified wood policy in its [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system. Since its inception, LEED has only accepted wood certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ndash; Tristan Roberts |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2010/12/7/Not-Enough-Votes-for-LEED-Certified-Wood-Benchmark/ |title=Environmental Building News |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two largest third-party forest certification standards in the United States – the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fscus.org/green_building/index.php |title=Forest Stewardship Council |publisher=Fscus.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/leed/index.php |title=Sustainable Forestry Initiative |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; – opposed the proposed benchmarks. FSC questioned their rigor and SFI claimed the process was overly detailed and complex.

A number of organizations, including the [[National Association of State Foresters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateforesters.org/node/886 |title=National Association of State Foresters Resolution 2008-6: Green Building and the Role of Wood Products |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian Institute of Forestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cif-ifc.org/uploads//Website_Assets/USGB_media_release_April_19_2010.pdf |title=Canadian Institute of Forestry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society of American Foresters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goergen |first=Michael T. |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2011509983_guest03green.html |title=Michael Goergen, Society of American Foresters Column in Seattle Times |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for LEED to recognize all credible certification programs to encourage the use of wood as a green building material.

In its 2008-2009 Forest Products Annual Review, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated that green building initiatives (GBI) can be a mixed blessing for wood products. “GBI standards giving exclusive recognition to particular
forest-certification brands may help drive demand for these brands at the expense of wider appreciation of the environmental merits of wood.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 123 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2009-2010 review, the UNECE/FAO reported growing convergence between certification systems: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 121 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IAESTE letter.png|thumb|Letter from [[United Nations]] General Secretary [[Ban Ki-moon]].]]
The '''International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience''' commonly referred to as IAESTE (pronounced i-a-es-te or ai-es-te) is an international organization exchanging students for technical work experience abroad. Students gain relevant technical [[training]] lasting from 4 weeks to 18 months. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered "associacion sans but lucratif" ([[non-profit organization]]), with the centre in [[Luxembourg]]. The current President is prof. Bernard Baeyens from [[Colombia]]. IAESTE's motto is "Work, Experience, Discover". IAESTE's aims are to connect students with employers in foreign countries, provide university students with technical experience, and culturally enrich students and their host communities.

==History==
IAESTE was founded in 1948 at [[Imperial College]], [[London]]. The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a [[Effects of World War II#A New Europe|post war]] effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures.

Since 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students. IAESTE exchanges around 7000 students annually playing an important role in giving technical undergraduates practical work experience and a global perspective.

==Organization structure==

===International organization structure===
The IAESTE Association is a confederation of National Committees representing academic, industrial, and student interests. Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion.

The Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President.

The GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the ''Exchange Sessions''. During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home.

One other notable event at the GC is the "International Party". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes.

The international work is funded by member fees based on [[GDP per capita]] and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees.

===National organization structure===
The National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests.  Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee.

Each National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system, and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff.

Every country has their own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories:
* Student driven - The National Secretary is a student, normally serving for one to two years. Often there is one employed administrative staff for paperwork and keeping contact with other national committees, but the students are making decisions, organizing trainees and even raising funds. Examples are Norway, Denmark, Austria, Slovakia or Croatia (see [[#CEC|CEC]]).
* Academically - The National Secretary is a professor or employed by a university to front IAESTE on the behalf of the university or the country. Usually, they have students to welcome trainees, but students are not involved in the decision-making. Examples are Turkey, Portugal.
* Governmental - An employee of a governmental international work exchange organization is the National Secretary. Usually the organization is responsible for several exchange programs and is quite professional. They also often employ students to welcome incoming students. Examples are Finland, Switzerland and UK.
* Other - Non-profit organizations funded by various sources (students, companies, government) but not affiliated with a single institution. Examples are China, USA.

IAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaeste.no/nyweb/modules/content/index.php?id=78 Example from Norway of the social part of being a trainee]&lt;/ref&gt; while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.

==Annual Conference (AC)==
The most important international event that connects IAESTE leaders from all over the world. Next AC will be held by IAESTE Cyprus. It will host the 72nd IAESTE Annual Conference in January 2019 (18 January to 24 January 2019 in Limassol). More information you can find [http://web.cut.ac.cy/iaeste-cy2019/ here].
73rd AC will be held by IAESTE Slovakia in January 2020.

==The IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN)==
The Friends of IAESTE Network (FoIN) was founded 1996 in Denmark as the official Alumni branch of IAESTE, with the goal of helping former IAESTE trainees and members keep in touch.

In 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities. The current holder of this position is Bruce Wicks from the [[United Kingdom]]. In 2011, IAN launched a new, online network which currently has over 10,000 members.

==IAESTE Day==
In 2005, an international IAESTE Day was created, for the purpose of global promotion of the organization as well as the celebration of its aims and goals. Starting with 6 countries, IAESTE Day was celebrated in 28 of its member countries in 2007. IAESTE Day is held on 20 October every year.

==JUMP==
Join Us to Motivate People (JUMP) is the "Motivation and Training Seminar" of IAESTE. JUMP was founded in 1995 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] on the initiative of Martin Klaus, former National Secretary of IAESTE Austria. Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland, and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland.
JUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE.

Primarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs.  The theme song for the seminar is [[Jump (For My Love)]] by the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Usually 40 - 70 participants take part in the event. Each JUMP is combined of six workshop sessions, led by experienced members, that cover the essence of IAESTE activities:
*Introduction to IAESTE
*Administration
*Company Marketing and Fundraising
*Job-Raising
*Local Committee Management
*Student Marketing and Member-Raising
Additionally all participants visit various information boots on the topics of summer reception, career fairs, career websites, etc. All together combined with IAESTE related games, international evening, sightseeing trip and company presentation to show that IAESTE is much more than the exchange of job offers. One of the other highlights are motivation speeches by invited guests.

==CEC==
The '''Central European Convention''' is a group of several [[IAESTE]] member countries in the specific geographic region. Those are all "student-run" countries, so students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries).

Those countries agree to meet twice a year and hold working and discussion groups. At the same time, they get to know the culture of the hosting country.

===Goals===

* Motivation
* Education
* Developing IAESTE
* Improve the situation of student run countries

===History===
The Central European Convention (CEC) was founded in May 1998 in [[Tuheljske Toplice]], [[Croatia]], on the initiative of Thomas Haim, former National Secretary IAESTE AUSTRIA, and Mario Kauzlaric, former National Secretary IAESTE CROATIA. Because of the great success, the CEC is held 2 times a year.

'''Kanai Yoshiko''' ('''{{lang-ja|金井淑子}}''', born 1944) is Japanese academic and feminist theorist. She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by [[gender binary|dualistic]] definitions of gender. Coining the phrase "housewife feminism", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.

==Early life==
Kanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 &lt;!-- on 5 October 1944 --&gt; in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan. She graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}}

==Career==
Kanai began her career at the newly established [[Nagaoka Women's Junior College]] in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on [[women's studies]]. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at [[Yokohama National University]] in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at [[Rissho University]], from which she retired in 2015.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}} 

Kanai was most known as a specialist in [[gender studies]] and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|p=x}}{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} She coined the phrase "housewife feminism" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying [[systemic bias]]es.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=160-161}} She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of [[identity politics]] on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them.{{sfn|Loftus|1997}} In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a [[binary gender]] model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife.{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues.{{sfn||Liddle|Nakajimo|2000|p=11}} She has noted that the failure to grasp that "…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=161}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">==Physical limits==
There are several physical and practical limits to the amount of [[computation]] or [[data storage device|data storage]] that can be performed with a given amount of mass, volume, or energy:

* The [[Bekenstein bound]] limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.
* Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice it is a stronger bound than Bekenstein bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandberg|first=Anders|title=The Physics of Information Processing Superobjects: Daily Life Among the Jupiter Brains|date=22 December 1999|url=http://transhumanist.com/volume5/Brains2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Landauer's principle]] defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: {{math|''[[Boltzmann constant|k]]T'' ln 2}} [[joule]]s consumed per irreversible state change, where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the operating temperature of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The physics of forgetting: Landauer's erasure principle and information theory|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00107510010018916|pages=25–60|issn=0010-7514|eissn=1366-5812|last=Vitelli|first=M.B.|last2=Plenio|first2=V.|date=2001|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/55905.PDF|arxiv=quant-ph/0103108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reversible computing]] is not subject to this lower bound.  ''T'' cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 [[kelvins]], the approximate temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation.
* [[Bremermann's limit]] is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.
* The [[Margolus–Levitin theorem]] sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second per [[joule]]. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amount of energy/time per one elementary computation step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Stephen P.|title=Fast quantum computation at arbitrarily low energy|journal = Phys. Rev. A | volume = 95 | pages=032305 | year=2017 |arxiv = 1701.01175|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01175.pdf | doi=10.1103/physreva.95.032305|bibcode=2017PhRvA..95c2305J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinitsyn|first=Nikolai A.|title=Is there a quantum limit on speed of computation?|year=2017|arxiv = 1701.05550|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05550.pdf|bibcode=2018PhLA..382..477S|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building devices that approach physical limits==
Several methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits:
* A cold [[degenerate star]] could conceivably be used as a giant data storage device, by carefully perturbing it to various excited states, in the same manner as an atom or [[quantum well]] used for these purposes. Such a star would have to be artificially constructed, as no natural degenerate stars will cool to this temperature for an extremely long time. It is also possible that [[nucleon]]s on the surface of [[neutron star]]s could form complex "molecules",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title=Life on neutron stars |encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |publisher= |location= |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/neutronstarlife.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; which some have suggested might be used for computing purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/essays/femtotech.html |title=Femtotech? (Sub)Nuclear Scale Engineering and Computation |accessdate=2006-10-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025030505/http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/essays/femtotech.html |archivedate=October 25, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a type of [[computronium]] based on [[femtotechnology]], which would be faster and denser than computronium based on [[nanotechnology]].
* It may be possible to use a [[black hole]] as a data storage or computing device, if a practical mechanism for extraction of contained information can be found. Such extraction may in principle be possible ([[Stephen Hawking]]'s proposed resolution to the [[black hole information paradox]]). This would achieve storage density exactly equal to the [[Bekenstein bound]]. [[Seth Lloyd]] calculated&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9908043.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the computational abilities of an "ultimate laptop" formed by compressing a kilogram of matter into a black hole of radius 1.485 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; meters, concluding that it would only last about 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; seconds before [[Hawking radiation#Black hole evaporation|evaporating]] due to [[Hawking radiation]], but that during this brief time it could compute at a rate of about 5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second, ultimately performing about 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; operations on 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; bits (~1 [[petabyte|PB]]). Lloyd notes that "Interestingly, although this hypothetical computation is performed at ultra-high densities and speeds, the total number of bits available to be processed is not far from the number available to current computers operating in more familiar surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd |first=Seth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |month= |title=Ultimate physical limits to computation |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=406 |issue=6799 |pages=1047–1054 |doi=10.1038/35023282 |url=http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/QM/lloyd_nature_406_1047_00.pdf |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10984064 |arxiv=quant-ph/9908043 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173904/http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/QM/lloyd_nature_406_1047_00.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'', Ray Kurzweil cites the calculations of Seth Lloyd that a universal-scale computer is capable of 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second. The mass of the universe can be estimated at 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms. If all matter in the universe was turned into a black hole it would have a lifetime of 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;139&lt;/sup&gt; seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation. During that lifetime such a universal-scale black hole computer would perform 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt; operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=New York: Viking|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is expected that a black hole computer cannot find exact solutions to all [[NP-completeness|NP-Complete]] problems in polynomial time since they scale as &lt;math&gt;O({2^N})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O({N!})&lt;/math&gt;. Searching for an exact solution to a [[Travelling salesman problem|Traveling Salesman Problem]] with an instance of 3000 locations would take both the standard [[Grover's algorithm]] with &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps and [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian]] [[Grover's algorithm]] with &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt[3]{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps more than 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt; operations.

==Abstract limits in computer science==
In the field of theoretical [[computer science]] the [[Computability Theory|computability]] and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computational problems are often sought-after.  Computability theory describes the degree to which problems are computable; whereas complexity theory describes the asymptotic degree of resource consumption.  Computational problems are therefore confined into [[complexity classes]].  The [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[polynomial hierarchy]] classify the degree to which problems are respectively computable and computable in polynomial time.  For instance, the level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy classifies computable, partial functions.  Moreover, this hierarchy is strict such that at any other class in the arithmetic hierarchy classifies strictly [[Uncomputable function|uncomputable]] functions.

==Loose and tight limits==
Many limits derived in terms of physical constants and abstract models of computation in Computer Science are loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markov |first=Igor |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2014 |month= |title=Limits on Fundamental Limits to Computation|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=512 |issue= |pages=147–154|doi=10.1038/nature13570 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=1408.3821 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..147M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few known limits directly obstruct leading-edge technologies, but many engineering obstacles currently cannot be explained by closed-form limits.

[[Convergent evolution]] — the repeated evolution of similar traits in multiple lineages which all ancestrally lack the trait — is rife in nature, as illustrated by the examples below. The ultimate cause of convergence is usually a similar evolutionary [[biome]], as similar environments will select for similar traits in any species occupying the same ecological niche, even if those species are only distantly related. In the case of [[cryptic species]], it can create species which are only distinguishable by analysing their genetics.  Unrelated organisms often develop [[analogous structures]] by adapting to similar environments.

==In animals==
[[File:Beutelwolf fg01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The skulls of the [[thylacine]] (left) and the grey wolf, ''[[Canis lupus]]'', are similar, although the species are only very distantly related (different [[infraclass]]es). The skull shape of the red fox, ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'', is even closer to that of the thylacine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=34|issue=2|year=1986|pages=109–117|title=Comparison of Skull Shape in Marsupial and Placental Carnivores|author= L Werdelin|doi=10.1071/ZO9860109}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Mammals ===

* Several groups of [[ungulate]]s have independently reduced or lost side digits on their feet, often leaving one or two digits for walking. That name comes from their hooves, which have evolved from claws several times. Among familiar animals, [[horse]]s have one walking digit and [[cattle|domestic bovine]]s two on each foot. Various other land vertebrates have also reduced or lost digits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donaldprothero.com/files/47440214.pdf The phylogeny of the ungulates - Donald Prothero]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, [[laurasiathere]] [[perissodactyl]]s and [[afrothere]] [[paenungulate]]s have several features in common, to the point of there being no obvious distinction among basal taxa of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gheerbrant | first1 = Emmanuel | last2 = Filippo | first2 = Andrea | last3 = Schmitt | first3 = Arnaud | year = 2016 | title = Convergence of Afrotherian and Laurasiatherian Ungulate-Like Mammals: First Morphological Evidence from the Paleocene of Morocco | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 7| page = e0157556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0157556 | pmid=27384169 | pmc=4934866| bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1157556G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pronghorn]] of [[North America]], while not a true [[antelope]] and only distantly related to them, closely resembles the true antelopes of the [[Old World]], both behaviorally and morphologically. It also fills a similar ecological niche and is found in the same [[biome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcnj.edu/~hofmann/Pronghorn.htm tcnj.edu, ANTELOPE Vs. PRONGHORN]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of the two clades [[Australosphenida]] and [[Theria]] evolved tribosphenic [[molar (tooth)|molars]] independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luo | first1 = Zhe-Xi | last2 = Cifelli | first2 = Richard L. | last3 = Kielan-Jaworowska | first3 = Zofia | year = 2001 | title = Dual origin of tribosphenic mammals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6816| pages = 53–57 | doi = 10.1038/35051023 | pmid = 11343108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[marsupial]] [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf) had many resemblances to [[placental]] [[canids]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyletaitt.scienceblog.com/2013/02/07/the-curious-evolutionary-history-of-the-marsupial-wolf/ The Curious Evolutionary History of the ‘Marsupial Wolf’ by Kyle Taitt]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several mammal groups have independently evolved prickly protrusions of the skin – [[echidna]]s ([[monotreme]]s), the insectivorous [[hedgehog]]s, some [[tenrec]]s (a diverse group of shrew-like [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] mammals), [[Old World porcupine]]s ([[rodent]]s) and [[New World porcupine]]s (another biological family of rodents). In this case, because the two groups of porcupines are closely related, they would be considered to be examples of [[parallel evolution]]; however, neither echidnas, nor hedgehogs, nor tenrecs are close relatives of the Rodentia. In fact, the last common ancestor of all of these groups was a contemporary of the [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Zoology, Page 102, by Joseph Springer, Dennis Holley, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[eutriconodont]] [[Spinolestes]] that lived in the Early Cretaceous Period represents an even earlier example of a spined mammal, unrelated to any modern mammal group.
* [[Cat|Cat-like]] sabre-toothed predators evolved in three distinct lineages of mammals – [[carnivora]]ns like the [[sabre-toothed cat]]s, and [[nimravid]]s ("false" sabre-tooths), the [[sparassodont]] family [[Thylacosmilidae]] ("marsupial" sabre-tooths), the [[gorgonopsid]]s and the [[creodont]]s also developed long [[canine teeth]], but with no other particular physical similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Convergent Evolution: Limited Forms Most Beautiful, page 158, by George R. McGhee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of mammals have developed powerful fore claws and long, sticky tongues that allow them to open the homes of social insects (e.g., [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s) and consume them (myrmecophagy).  These include the four species of [[anteater]], more than a dozen [[armadillo]]s, eight species of [[pangolin]] (plus fossil species), eight species of the [[monotreme]] (egg-laying mammals) [[echidna]] (plus fossil species), the  ''[[Fruitafossor]]'' of the Late Jurassic, the marsupial [[numbat]], the African [[aardvark]], the [[aardwolf]], and possibly also the [[sloth bear]] of South Asia, all unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/science/when-nature-discovers-the-same-design-over-and-over.html When Nature Discovers The Same Design Over and Over, By NATALIE ANGIER, Published: December 15, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[Koalas]] of [[Australia]] have evolved [[fingerprint]]s, indistinguishable from those of non-related [[primates]], such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A14608541 BBC, Koalas' Fingerprints]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Australian [[honey possum]]s acquired a long tongue for taking nectar from flowers, a structure similar to that of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies]], some moths, and hummingbirds, and used to accomplish the same task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reellifescience.com/2013/10/16/convergent-evolution-are-dolphins-and-bats-more-related-than-we-think-by-cariosa-switzer/ Convergent EVOLUTION: "Are Dolphins and Bats more related than we think?" by Cariosa Switzer, October 16, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marsupial]] [[sugar glider]] and [[squirrel glider]] of Australia are like the [[placental]] [[flying squirrel]]. Both lineages have independently developed wing-like flaps ([[patagia]]) for leaping from trees, and big eyes for foraging at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analogy: Squirrels and Sugar Gliders|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_02|work=Understanding Evolution|publisher=The University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The North American [[kangaroo rat]], Australian [[hopping mouse]], and [[North Africa]]n and Asian [[jerboa]] have developed convergent adaptations for hot desert environments; these include a small rounded body shape with large hind legs and long thin tails, a characteristic [[bipedal]] hop, and nocturnal, burrowing and seed-eating behaviours. These rodent groups fill similar niches in their respective ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desertusa.com/animals /jerboa.html desertusa.com, The Jerboa, by Jay Sharp]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Opossum]]s and their [[Phalangeriformes|Australasian cousin]]s have evolved an [[opposable thumb]], a feature which is also commonly found in the non-related [[primates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacusers.johnabbott.qc.ca/~biology/NYA/labs/NYASKELETONLAB/NYASKELETONINDEX-1.htm johnabbott.qc.ca, COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF VERTEBRATE SKELETA]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[marsupial]] [[Tasmanian devil]] has many resemblances to the [[placental]] [[hyena]] or a [[wolverine]]. Similar skull morphology, large canines and crushing carnasial molars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devilsatcradle.com/content.php?id=devil-facts devilsatcradle.com, Tasmanian Devil - Sarcophilus harrisii Taxonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Thylacoleonidae|marsupial lion]], ''[[Thylacoleo carnifex]]'', had retractable claws, the same way the placental [[Felinae|felines]] ([[cat]]s) do today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/Thylacoleo.htm nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au Thylacoleo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085747/http://www.nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/Thylacoleo.htm |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microbat]]s, [[toothed whale]]s and [[shrew]]s developed [[sonar]]-like [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] systems used for orientation, obstacle avoidance and for locating prey. Modern DNA phylogenies of bats have shown that the traditional suborder of echolocating bats (Microchiroptera) is not a true clade, and instead some echolocating bats are more related to non-echolocating Old World fruit bats than to other echolocating species. The implication is that [[Animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in at least two lineages of [[bat]]s, [[Megachiroptera]] and [[Microchiroptera]] has evolved independently or been lost in Old World fruit bats.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk.

* [[Swim bladder]]s: Buoyant bladders independently evolved in [[fish]]es, the [[tuberculate pelagic octopus]], and [[siphonophores]] such as the [[Portuguese man o' war]].&lt;ref&gt;"The illustration of the swim bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely, flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely, respiration. The swim bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or "ideally similar" in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.  According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype, which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder."  Darwin, Origin of Species.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bivalve]]s and [[brachiopod]]s independently evolved paired hinged shells for protection.

*[[Slime mold]]s are traditionally classified as fungi, but molecular-phylogeny work has revealed that most slime molds are not very close to Fungi proper and similar organisms, and that their slime-mold habit has originated several times.

Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar functions with different structure.

* The convergent orientation of the [[catalytic triad]] in the [[active site]] of [[serine protease|serine]] and [[cysteine protease]]s independently in over 20 [[enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA |title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Feb 19, 2013|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|pmid=23382230|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of an N-terminal [[threonine]] for proteolysis. 
* The existence of distinct families of [[carbonic anhydrase]] is believed to illustrate convergent evolution.
* The use of (''Z'')-7-dodecen-1-yl acetate as a [[sex pheromone]] by the [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus'') and by more than 100 species of [[Lepidoptera]].
* The biosynthesis of plant hormones such as [[gibberellin]] and [[abscisic acid]] by different biochemical pathways in plants and fungi.&lt;ref name="Tudzynski"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tudzynski B.|year= 2005|title=Gibberellin biosynthesis in fungi: genes, enzymes, evolution, and impact on biotechnology|journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol|volume=66|pages=597–611|pmid=15578178 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-004-1805-1|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siewers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siewers V, Smedsgaard J, Tudzynski P |title=The P450 monooxygenase BcABA1 is essential for abscisic acid biosynthesis in Botrytis cinerea |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=7 |pages=3868–76 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15240257 |pmc=444755 |doi=10.1128/AEM.70.7.3868-3876.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The protein [[prestin]] that drives the cochlea amplifier and confers high auditory sensitivity in mammals, shows numerous convergent amino acid replacements in [[bat]]s and dolphins, both of which have independently evolved high frequency hearing for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="Liu2010first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu2010"/&gt; This same signature of convergence has also been found in other genes expressed in the mammalian cochlea&lt;ref name="Davies2011"/&gt;
* The repeated independent evolution of [[nylonase]] in two different strains of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' and one strain of ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.
* The [[myoglobin]] from the abalone ''Sulculus diversicolor'' has a different structure from normal myoglobin but serves a similar function — binding oxygen reversibly. "The molecular weight of Sulculus myoglobin is 41kD, 2.5 times larger than other myoglobins." Moreover, its amino acid sequence has no homology with other invertebrate myoglobins or with hemoglobins, but is 35% homologous with human [[Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase|indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO)]], a vertebrate tryptophan-degrading enzyme. It does not share similar function with IDO. "The IDO-like myoglobin is unexpectedly widely distributed among ''gastropodic molluscs'', such as ''Sulculus'', ''Nordotis'', ''Battilus'', ''Omphalius'' and ''Chlorostoma''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki T, Yuasa H, Imai K |title=Convergent evolution.

* The [[hemocyanin]] from [[arthropod]]s and [[mollusca|molluscs]] evolved from different ancestors, [[tyrosinase]] and insect storage proteins, respectively. They have different molecular weight and structure. However, the proteins both use copper binding sites to transport oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Anupam N&amp;am, Jimmy Ng and Trustin Ennacheril, "The Molecular Evolution of Arthropod &amp; Molluscan Hemocyanin, Evidence for Apomorphic origin and convergent evolution in O2 hinding sites", December 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[hexokinase]], [[ribokinase]], and [[galactokinase]] families of sugar kinases have similar enzymatic functions of sugar phosphorylation, but they evolved from three distinct nonhomologous families since they all have distinct three-dimensional folding and their conserved sequence patterns are strikingly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bork P, Sander C, Valencia A |title=Convergent evolution of similar enzymatic function on different protein folds: the hexokinase, ribokinase, and galactokinase families of sugar kinases |journal=Protein Science |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |date=January 1993  |pmid=8382990 |pmc=2142297 |doi=10.1002/pro.5560020104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hemoglobins]] in jawed vertebrates and jawless fish evolved independently. The oxygen-binding hemoglobins of jawless fish evolved from an ancestor of cytoglobin which has no oxygen transport function and is expressed in fibroblast cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffmann FG, Opazo JC, Storz JF |title=Gene cooption and convergent evolution of oxygen transport hemoglobins in jawed and jawless vertebrates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=107 |issue=32 |pages=14274–9 |date=August 2010  |pmid=20660759 |pmc=2922537 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1006756107|bibcode=2010PNAS..10714274H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Toxic agent, [[serine protease]] BLTX, in the venom produced by two distinct species, the [[Northern short-tailed shrew|North American short-tailed shrew]] ''Blarina brevicauda'' and the Mexican [[beaded lizard]], undergo convergent evolution. Although their structures are similar, it turns out that they increased the enzyme activity and toxicity through different way of structure changes. These changes are not found in the other non-venomous reptiles or mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aminetzach YT, Srouji JR, Kong CY, Hoekstra HE |title=Convergent evolution of novel protein function in shrew and lizard venom |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |issue=22 |pages=1925–31 |date=December 2009  |pmid=19879144 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another toxin BgK, a K+ channel-blocking toxin from the [[sea anemone]] [[Bunodosoma|''Bunodosoma granulifera'']] and [[scorpion]]s adopt distinct scaffolds and unrelated structures, however, they have similar functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dauplais M, Lecoq A, Song J, etal |title=On the convergent evolution of animal toxins. Conservation of a diad of functional residues in potassium channel-blocking toxins with unrelated structures |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=272 |issue=7 |pages=4302–9 |date=February 1997  |pmid=9020148 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9020148 |doi=10.1074/jbc.272.7.4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Antifreeze proteins]] are a perfect example of convergent evolution. Different small proteins with a flat surface which is rich in threonine from different organisms are selected to bind to the surface of ice crystals. "These include two proteins from fish, the ocean pout and the winter flounder, and three very active proteins from insects, the yellow mealworm beetle, the spruce budworm moth, and the snow flea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Venketesh S, Dayananda C |title=Properties, potentials, and prospects of antifreeze proteins |journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=57–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18322856 |doi=10.1080/07388550801891152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[RNA-binding protein]]s which contain RNA-binding domain (RBD) and the [[cold-shock domain]] (CSD) protein family are also an example of convergent evolution. Except that they both have conserved RNP motifs, other protein sequence are totally different. However, they have a similar function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graumann P, Marahiel MA |title=A case of convergent evolution of nucleic acid binding modules |journal=BioEssays |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=309–15 |date=April 1996  |pmid=8967899 |doi=10.1002/bies.950180409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blue-light-receptive [[cryptochrome]] expressed in the [[sponge]] eyes likely evolved convergently in the absence of [[opsin]]s and nervous systems. The fully sequenced genome of ''[[Amphimedon queenslandica]]'', a demosponge larvae, lacks one vital visual component: opsin-a gene for a light-sensitive opsin pigment which is essential for vision in other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Ajna S. Rivera, Todd H. Oakley, etc. Blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is expressed in a sponge eye lacking neurons and Opsin, The Journal of Experimental Biology 215, 1278-1286&lt;/ref&gt;
* The structure of [[immunoglobulin]] G-binding bacterial proteins A and H do not contain any sequences homologous to the constant repeats of IgG antibodies, but they have similar functions. Both protein G, A, H are inhibited in the interactions with IgG antibodies (IgGFc) by a synthetic peptide corresponding to an 11-amino-acid-long sequence in the COOH-terminal region of the repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Frick IM, Wikström M, Forsén S, etal |title=Convergent evolution among immunoglobulin G-binding bacterial proteins |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=89 |issue=18 |pages=8532–6 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1528858 |pmc=49954 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.18.8532|bibcode=1992PNAS...89.8532F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural convergence ===
Here is a list of examples in which unrelated proteins have similar tertiary structures but different functions. Whole protein structural convergence is not thought to occur but some convergence of pockets and secondary structural elements have been documented.

* Some secondary structure convergence occurs due to some residues favouring being in α-helix (helical propensity) and for hydrophobic patches or pocket to be formed at the ends of the parallel sheets.&lt;ref name="Rao, S. T. 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao ST, Rossmann MG |title=Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=241–56 |date=May 1973  |pmid=4737475 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://scoppi.biotec.tu-dresden.de/abac/ ABAC] is a database of convergently evolved protein interaction interfaces. Examples comprise fibronectin/long chain cytokines, NEF/SH2, cyclophilin/capsid proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henschel A, Kim WK, Schroeder M |title=Equivalent binding sites reveal convergently evolved interaction motifs |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=550–5 |date=March 2006  |pmid=16287935 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="188713">In [[biological nomenclature]], organisms often receive [[scientific name]]s that honor a person. A [[taxon]] (e.g. [[species]] or [[genus]]; plural: taxa) named in honor of another entity is an [[eponym|eponymous taxon]], and names specifically honoring a person or persons are known as [[patronym (taxonomy)|patronyms]]. Scientific names are generally formally published in peer-reviewed journal articles or larger [[monograph]]s along with descriptions of the named taxa and ways to distinguish them from other taxa. Following rules of [[Latin grammar]], species or subspecies names derived from a man's name often end in ''-i'' or ''-ii'' if named for an individual, and ''-orum'' if named for a group of men or mixed-sex group, such as a family. Similarly, those named for a woman often end in ''-ae'', or ''-arum'' for two or more women.

This list includes organisms named after famous individuals or ensembles (including bands and comedy troupes), but excludes companies, institutions, [[people|ethnic groups or nationalities]], and populated places. It does not include organisms named for fictional entities, for biologists or other natural scientists,{{efn|[[Charles Darwin]], for instance has over [[Commemoration of Charles Darwin#Species|120 eponymous organisms]]}} nor for associates or family members of researchers who are not otherwise notable. The scientific names are given as originally described (their [[basionym]]s): subsequent research may have placed species in different genera, or rendered them [[synonym (biology)|taxonomic synonyms]] of previously described taxa. Some of these names are [[unavailable name|unavailable]] in the zoological sense or [[Nomen illegitimum|illegitimate]] in the botanical sense due to [[senior homonym]]s already having the same name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5206">'''Machine element''' refers to an elementary component of a [[machine]].  These elements consist of three basic types:
# ''[[Structural_element|structural components]]'' such as frame members, [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], [[Axle|axles]], [[Spline_(mechanical)|splines]], [[fastener]]s, [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]s, and [[lubricant]]s, 
# ''[[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]]'' that [[Motion_control|control movement]] in various ways such as [[gear train]]s, [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] or [[chain drive]]s, [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] systems, including [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es, and 
# ''[[Control_system|control components]]'' such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Norton, '''Machine Design,''' (4th Edition), Prentice-Hall, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  

While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a [[industrial design|styling and operational interface]] between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

''Machine elements'' are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most [[machine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Matthews | first = Clifford | last2 = [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] | title = ASME engineer's data book | page = 249 | publisher = ASME Press | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dPS2KU0gj-8C&amp;pg=PA249 | isbn = 978-0-7918-0229-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are [[Technical standard|standardized]] to common sizes, but customs are also common for specialized applications.&lt;ref name="bhandari"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bhandari | first = V.

Machine elements may be features of a part (such as screw threads or integral plain bearings) or they may be discrete parts in and of themselves such as wheels, axles, pulleys, [[rolling-element bearing]]s, or gears. All of the [[simple machine]]s may be described as machine elements, and many machine elements incorporate concepts of one or more simple machines.  For example, a [[leadscrew]] incorporates a [[screw thread]], which is an [[inclined plane]] wrapped around a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. 

Many mechanical design, invention, and engineering tasks involve a knowledge of various machine elements and an intelligent and creative combining of these elements into a component or assembly that fills a need (serves an application).

[[File:National Climate Assessment Annual Arctic Minimum Sea Ice Extents (1978-2012).ogv|thumb|Animation of Minimum Annual Sea Ice Extent over the Arctic from 1979 to 2012.]]
[[File:2013 Daily Arctic Sea Ice from AMSR2 - May - September 2013.ogv|thumb|In this animation, the daily Arctic sea ice and seasonal land cover change progress through time, from May 16, 2013 through September 12, 2013, when the sea ice reached its minimum area of coverage for 2013.]]

'''Measurement of sea ice''' is important for safety of [[navigation]] and for monitoring the [[Natural environment|environment]], particularly the [[climate]]. Sea ice extent interacts with large climate patterns such as the [[North Atlantic oscillation]] and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]], to name just two, and influences climate in the rest of the globe.

The amount of [[sea ice]] coverage in the arctic has been of interest for centuries, as the [[Northwest Passage]] was of high interest for trade and seafaring. There is a longstanding history of records and measurements of some effects of the sea ice extent, but comprehensive measurements were sparse till the 1950s and started with the [[satellite]] era in the late 1970s. Modern direct records include data about ice extent, ice area, concentration, thickness, and the age of the ice.  The current trends in the records show a significant decline in [[Northern hemisphere]] sea ice and a small but statistically significant increase in the ''winter'' [[Southern hemisphere]] sea ice.

Furthermore, current research comprises and establishes extensive sets of multi-century historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo-proxy sea-ice records.&lt;ref name=colo&gt;[http://instaar.colorado.edu/meetings/AW2012/abstract_details.php?abstract_id=45 Signal of Persistent Multidecadal Variability in Wintertime Sea-Ice Records: Linkages to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Miles, Martin et al., 42nd Annual International Arctic Workshop  will be held 7-9 March 2012 in Winter Park, Colorado]
&lt;/ref&gt; The arctic sea ice is a dynamic climate-system component and is linked to the Atlantic multidecadal variability and the historical climate over various decades. There are circular changes of sea ice patterns but so far no clear patterns based on modeling predictions.

== Methods of measuring sea ice ==

===Early observations===

Records assembled by [[Vikings]] showing the number of weeks per year that ice occurred along the north coast of [[Iceland]] date back to A.D. 870, but a more complete record exists since 1600. More extensive written records of Arctic sea ice date back to the mid-18th century. The earliest of those records relate to Northern Hemisphere shipping lanes, but records from that period are sparse. Air temperature records dating back to the 1880s can serve as a stand-in (proxy) for Arctic sea ice, but such temperature records were initially collected at only 11 locations. [[Russia|Russia’s]] Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute has compiled ice charts dating back to 1933. Today, scientists studying Arctic sea ice trends can rely on a fairly comprehensive record dating back to 1953, using a combination of satellite records, shipping records, and ice charts from several countries.&lt;ref name="NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SeaIce/page2.php|title=NASA Earth Observatory - Monitoring Sea Ice|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Antarctic, direct data prior to the satellite record are even more sparse. To try to extend the historical record of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent further back in time, scientists have been investigating various proxies for sea ice extent. One is records kept by Antarctic [[whaler]]s that document the location of all whales caught and relate to sea ice observations directly. There seems to be an abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records, the direct global estimates of the Antarctic sea-ice cover from satellite observations, since the 1970 provide no clear trends.&lt;ref name= Mare /&gt; Because whales tend to congregate near the sea ice edge to feed, their locations could be a proxy for the ice extent. Other proxies use the presence of [[phytoplankton|phytoplankton-derived]] organic compounds and other extremophiles traces &lt;ref&gt;Science 25 January 2002: Vol. 295  no. 5555  pp. 641-644 DOI: 10.1126/science.1063391 Antarctic Sea Ice--a Habitat for Extremophiles D. N. Thomas, G. S. Dieckmann&lt;/ref&gt; in Antarctic [[ice core]]s and sediments. Since phytoplankton grow most abundantly along the edges of the ice pack, the concentration of this [[sulfur|sulfur-containing]] organic compounds and their geochemistry provide indicators of how far the ice edge extended from the continent. There are further extensive sets of multicentury historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo proxy sea-ice records.&lt;ref name=colo /&gt;

===Satellites===

[[File:DMSP Block-5D2.jpg|thumb|[[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP satellite]]]]
Useful satellite data concerning sea ice began in December 1972 with the [[Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer]] (ESMR) instrument. However, this was not directly comparable with the later SMMR/SSMI, and so the practical record begins in late 1978 with the launch of NASA’s [[Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer]] (SMMR) satellite.,&lt;ref name="NSIDC faq"/&gt; and continues with the [[Special Sensor Microwave/Imager]] (SSMI). [[AMSR|Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer]] (AMSR) and [[Cryosat-2]].

Since 1979, satellites have provided a consistent continuous record of sea ice.&lt;ref name = "NASA - Conclusions"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SeaIce/page5.php | publisher =  NASA | title = Sea Ice - Conclusions }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Satellite images of sea ice are made from observations of [[microwave]] energy radiated from the Earth’s surface. Because ocean water emits microwaves differently from sea ice, ice "looks" different from water to the satellite sensor—see [[sea ice emissivity modelling]]. The observations are processed into digital picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel represents a square surface area on Earth. The first instruments provided approximately 25 kilometers by 25 kilometers resolution; later instruments higher. Algorithms examine the microwave emissions, and their vertical and horizontal polarisations, and estimate the ice area.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

Sea ice may be considered in terms of total volume, or in terms of areal coverage. Volume is harder, because it requires a knowledge of the ice thickness, which is hard to measure directly; efforts such as PIOMAS &lt;ref&gt;http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/&lt;/ref&gt; use a combination of observations and modelling to estimate total volume.

There are two ways to express the total polar ice cover: ice area and ice extent. To estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as "ice-covered." The common threshold is 15 percent.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

The threshold–based approach may seem less accurate, but it has the advantage of being more consistent. When scientists are analyzing satellite data, it is easier to say whether there is or isn’t at least 15 percent ice cover in a pixel than it is to say, for example, whether the ice cover is 70 percent or 75 percent. By reducing the uncertainty in the amount of ice, scientists can be more certain that changes in sea ice cover over time are real.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

A careful analysis of satellite [[Radar altimeter|radar altimetry]] echoes can distinguish between those backscattered from the open ocean, new ice or multi-year ice.  The difference between the elevation of the echoes from snow/sea ice and open water gives the elevation of the ice above the ocean; the ice thickness can be computed from this.&lt;ref name= "Radar Altimetry Tutorial"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.altimetry.info/html/appli/ice/sea_ice_en.html | title = Radar Altimetry Tutorial | publisher = J. Benveniste and N. Picot Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has a limited vertical resolution - perhaps 0.5m - and is easily confused by the presence of even small amounts of open water. Hence it has mostly been used in the Arctic, where the ice is thicker and more continuous.

===Submarines===
Starting in 1958 [[Submarines in the United States Navy|U. S. Navy submarines]] collected upward-looking [[sonar]] profiles, for navigation and defense, and converted the information into estimates of ice thickness.&lt;ref name = "NASA - Satellites and Submarines"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/seaice_skinny.html | title = Satellites and Submarines Give the Skinny on Sea Ice Thickness | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from U. S. and [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Royal Navy submarines]] available from the [[NSIDC]] includes maps showing submarine tracks. Data are provided as ice draft profiles and as statistics derived from the profile data. Statistics files include information concerning ice draft characteristics, keels, level ice, leads, undeformed and deformed ice.&lt;ref name = "NSIDC Submarine Data"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://nsidc.org/data/g01360.html | title = Submarine Upward Looking Sonar Ice Draft Profile Data and Statistics | publisher = NSIDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buoys===
Buoys are placed on the ice to measure ice properties and weather conditions by the participants of the [[International Arctic Buoy Program]] and its sister, the [[International Programme for Antarctic Buoys]].  Buoys can have sensors to measure [[air temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure]], buoy position ice growth/melt, ice temperature, [[ocean currents]], sea ice motion, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, skin temperature, surface air temperature, surface winds, and water temperature.&lt;ref name= "NSIDC - IPAB Antarctic Drifting Buoy Data"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0084.html | title = NSIDC - IPAB Antarctic Drifting Buoy Data | publisher = NSIDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "IPAB - International Programme for Antarctic Buoys"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/ | title = IPAB - International Programme for Antarctic Buoys |publisher = IPAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "IAPB - International Arctic Buoy Programme"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/ | title = IAPB - International Arctic Buoy Programme |publisher = IAPB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upward looking sonar===
{{main|Upward looking sonar}}

Upward looking sonar (ULS) devices can be deployed under polar ice over a period of months or even years, and can provide a complete profile of ice thickness for a single site.

===Auxiliary observations===
Auxiliary observations of sea ice are made from shore stations, [[ships]], and from [[aircraft]].

Although  in  recent  years  remotely  sensed  data  has  come  to  play  a major  role  in  sea  ice  analysis,  it  is  not  yet  possible  to  compile  a complete  and  accurate  picture  of  sea  ice  conditions  from  this  data source  alone.  Auxiliary  sea  ice  observations  play  a  major  role  in confirming  remotely  sensed  ice  information  or  providing  important corrections  to  the  overall  picture  of  ice  conditions.&lt;ref name = "USN Handbook"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/SeaIce/Handbook%20for%20Sea%20Ice%20Analysis%20and%20Forecasting.07.pdf | title = Handbook for Sea Ice Analysis and Forecasting | publisher = U. S. Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  most  important  auxiliary  sea  ice  observation  is  the  location  of the  ice  edge.  Its  value  reflects  both  the  importance  of  the  ice  edge location  in  general  and  the  difficulty  of  accurately  locating  the  ice edge  with  remotely  sensed  data.  It  is  also  useful  to  provide  a  description of  the  ice  edge  in  terms  of  indications  of  freezing  or  thawing,  wind-driven  advance  or  retreat,  and  compactness  or  diffuseness.  Other important  auxiliary  information  includes  the  location  of  the [[icebergs]],  floebergs,  ice  islands,  old  ice,  ridging  and  hummocking. These  ice  features  are  poorly  monitored  by  remote  sensing  techniques  but are  very  important  aspects  of  the  ice  cover.&lt;ref name="USN Handbook"/&gt;

== Types of measurements ==

===Sea ice extent===
[[Image:ArcticSeaIceExtents.jpg|thumb|Sea Ice in the Arctic Ocean fluctuates with the seasons.]] 
Sea ice extent is the area of sea with a specified amount of ice, usually 15%.  To satellite microwave sensors, surface melt appears to be open water rather than water on top of sea ice. So, while reliable for measuring area most of the year, the microwave sensors are prone to underestimating the actual ice concentration and area when the surface is melting.&lt;ref name="MeierStroeve2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=Walter N.|last2=Stroeve|first2=Julienne|last3=Fetterer|first3=Florence|title=Whither Arctic sea ice? A clear signal of decline regionally, seasonally and extending beyond the satellite record|journal=Annals of Glaciology|volume=46|issue=1|year=2007|pages=428–434|issn=0260-3055 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/46/a46a251.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.3189/172756407782871170|bibcode=2007AnGla..46..428M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea ice area===
To estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as "ice-covered." The [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], one of NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers, monitors sea ice extent using a threshold of 15 percent.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

===Sea ice concentration===
{{main|Sea ice concentration}}
Sea ice concentration is the percentage of an area that is covered with sea ice.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

===Sea ice thickness===
{{main|Sea ice thickness}}
Sea ice thickness increases over time, and increases when winds and currents push the ice together.  The European Space Agency's [[Cryosat-2]] satellite was launched in April 2010 on a quest to map the thickness and shape of the Earth's polar ice cover.  Its single instrument - a SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter is able to measure the [[sea ice freeboard]].

===Sea ice age===
The age of the ice is another key descriptor of the state of the sea ice cover, since older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient than younger ice.  Sea ice rejects salt over time and becomes [[freezing point depression|less salty resulting in a higher melting point]].&lt;ref name="NSIDC faq"&gt;[http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/faq.html#area_extent   NSIDC -Frequently Asked Questions about Arctic sea ice]&lt;/ref&gt; A simple two-stage approach classifies sea ice into first year and multiyear ice. First-year is ice that has not yet survived a summer melt season, while multi-year ice has survived at least one summer and can be several years old.&lt;ref name = "SEARCH - Study of Enviromental Artic Change"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/seaice.html | title = Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Outlook 2009: Summary Report |publisher = SEARCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[sea ice growth processes]].

===Sea ice mass balance===
[[Image:Measuring Sea Ice Mass Balance.jpg|thumb|Measuring Sea Ice Mass Balance]]
Sea ice mass balance is the balance of how much the ice grows in the winter and melts in the summer. For Arctic sea ice virtually all of the growth occurs on the bottom of the ice. Melting occurs on both the top and the bottom of the ice. In the vast majority of cases all of the snow melts during the summer, typically in just a couple of weeks. The mass balance is a powerful concept since it is the great integrator of the heat budget. If there is a net increase of heat, then the ice will thin. A net cooling will result in thicker ice.&lt;ref name = "USACE - Sea Ice Mass Balance"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://imb.crrel.usace.army.mil/massisit.htm | title = Mass Balance, what is it? |publisher = Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making direct measurements of the mass balance is simple. An array of stakes and thickness gauges is used to measure ablation and accumulation of ice and snow at the top and bottom of the ice cover. In spite of the importance of mass balance measurements and the relatively simple equipment involved in making them, there are few observational results. This is due, in large part, to the expense involved in operating a long-term field camp to serve as the base for these studies.&lt;ref name = "USACE - Sea Ice Mass Balance" /&gt;

===Sea ice volume===

{{cite web |url=http://psc.apl.washington.edu/ArcticSeaiceVolume/IceVolume.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711152422/http://psc.apl.washington.edu/ArcticSeaiceVolume/IceVolume.php |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour W. Laxon et al., CryoSat-2 estimates of Arctic sea ice thickness and volume, Geophys. Res. Lett. , DOI: 10.1002/grl.50193, 28 FEB 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are no Arctic-wide or Antarctic-wide measurements of the volume of sea ice, but the volume of the Arctic sea ice is calculated using the [[Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System]] (PIOMAS) developed at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory/Polar Science Center.  PIOMAS blends satellite-observed sea ice concentrations into model calculations to estimate sea ice thickness and volume. Comparison with submarine, mooring, and satellite observations help increase the confidence of the model results.&lt;ref name= "NSIDC - June 8, 2010 "&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/| title = National Snow and Ice Data Center - Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis | publisher = NSIDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ICESat]] was a laser altimeter equipped satellite, which could measure the freeboard of ice flows.&lt;ref&gt;B.E.Schutz et al., "Overview Of The IceSat Mission", GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 32, L21S01, doi:10.1029/2005GL024009, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/icesat-20090707.html | title = Images: New NASA Satellite Survey Reveals Dramatic Arctic Sea Ice Thinning | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its active service period was from February 2003 to October 2009. Together with a set of auxiliary data like ice density, snow cover thickness, air pressure, water salinity one can calculate the flow thickness and thus its volume. Its data have been compared with the respective PIOMAS data and a reasonably agreement has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/validation/ | title = PIOMAS Ice Volume Validation and Uncertainty | publisher = Polar Science Center, University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryosat-2]], launched in April 2010, has the ability to measure the freeboard of ice flows, just like [[ICESat]], only that it uses radar instead of laser pulses. Data is calculated with the PIOMAS model.

== Trends in the data ==
Reliable and consistent records for all seasons are only available during the satellite era, from 1979 onwards.

===Northern hemisphere===
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline}}
[[File:Seaice-1870-part-2009.png|thumb|right|1870-2000 Northern hemisphere [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|sea ice extent]] in million square kilometers. Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near-constant level extent in Autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation.]]
According to scientific measurements, both the thickness and extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic have shown a dramatic decline over the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="MeierStroeve2007"/&gt;

Records before the satellite era are sparse.

The satellite-derived Antarctic sea ice trends show pronounced increase in the central Pacific sector  by ∼4–10% per decade and a decrease in the Bellingshausen/western Weddell sector with similar percentages but lower extent. There is a close connection to the Antarctic Oscillation of the further and impacts of positive polarities of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the latter. The magnitude of the ice changes associated with the AAO and ENSO are smaller than the regional ice trends and local (or less understood large) scale processes still need to be investigated for a complete explanations.&lt;ref name=cur&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Curry | first2 = J.

===Use of 1981 to 2010 as a baseline===
Scientists use the 1981 to 2010 average because it provides a consistent baseline for year-to-year comparisons of sea ice extent. Thirty years is considered a standard baseline period for weather and climate, and the satellite record is now long enough to provide a thirty-year baseline period.&lt;ref&gt;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/faq/#1979average&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''Obligatory passage point''' ('''OPP''') was developed by sociologist [[Michel Callon]] in a seminal contribution to [[actor–network theory]]: Callon, Michel (1986), "Elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay". ''In'' [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]] (Ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?'' London, Routledge: 196-233.

Obligatory passage points are a feature of actor-networks, usually associated with the initial ([[problematization]]) phase of a translation process. An OPP can be thought of as the narrow end of a funnel, that forces the actors to converge on a certain topic, purpose or question. The OPP thereby becomes a necessary element for the formation of a network and an [[action program]]. The OPP thereby mediates all interactions between actors in a network and defines the action program. Obligatory passage points allow for local networks to set up negotiation spaces that allow them a degree of autonomy from the global network of involved actors. 

If a project is unable to impose itself as a strong OPP between the global and local networks, it has no control over global resources such as financial and political support, which can be misused or withdrawn.  Additionally, a weak OPP is unable to take credit for the successes achieved within the local network, as outside actors are able to bypass its control and influence the local network directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shaping technology/building society:  Studies in sociotechnical change|author=John Law and Michel Callon|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 9780262023382|pages=42-46|editor=Wiebe E. Bijker and John Law|chapter=The life and death of an aircraft:  A network analysis of technical change}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An action program can comprise a number of different OPP's. An OPP can also be redefined as the problematization phase is revisited.

In Callon and [[John Law (sociologist)|Law's]] '"Engineering and Sociology in a Military Aircraft Project" &lt;ref&gt;In [[Susan Leigh Star|Star, S. L.]] (1995). ''Ecologies of knowledge: Work and politics in science and technology.'' State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the project management of a project to design a new strategic jet fighter for the British Military became an obligatory passage point between representatives of government and aerospace engineers.

In recent years, the notion of the Obligatory Passage Point has taken hold in the Information Systems Security and Information Privacy disciplines and journals. Backhouse et al. (2006) &lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, J., Hsu, C. W., &amp; Silva, L. (2006). Circuits of power in creating de jure standards: Shaping an international information systems security standard. ''Management Information Systems Quarterly, 30''(3), 413–438. doi:10.2307/25148767&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated how practices and policies are standardized and institutionalized through OPP.

'''Optical lens design''' is the process of designing a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to meet a set of performance requirements and constraints, including cost and manufacturing limitations. Parameters include surface profile types ([[spherical]], [[asphere|aspheric]], [[holographic]], [[diffraction|diffractive]], etc.), as well as [[Radius of curvature (optics)|radius of curvature]], distance to the next surface, material type and optionally tilt and decenter. The process is computationally intensive, using [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] or other techniques to model how the lens affects light that passes through it.

==Design requirements==
Performance requirements can include:

#[[optics|Optical]] performance (image quality): This is quantified by various metrics, including [[encircled energy]], [[modulation transfer function]], [[Strehl ratio]], ghost reflection control, and pupil performance (size, location and aberration control); the choice of the image quality metric is application specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical System Design |edition=2nd |first1=Robert E. |last1=Fischer |first2=Biljana |last2=Tadic-Galeb |first3=Paul R. |last3=Yoder |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2008 |pages=8, 179–198 |isbn=0-07-147248-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmundoptics.com/technical-resources-center/optics/modulation-transfer-function/ |title=Modulation Transfer Function}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
#Physical requirements such as [[weight]], static [[volume]], dynamic volume, [[center of gravity]] and overall configuration requirements.
#Environmental requirements: ranges for [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[oscillation|vibration]] and [[electromagnetic shielding]].

Design constraints can include realistic lens element center and edge thicknesses, minimum and maximum air-spaces between lenses, maximum constraints on entrance and exit angles, physically realizable glass [[index of refraction]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties.

Manufacturing costs and delivery schedules are also a major part of optical design. The price of an optical glass blank of given dimensions can vary by a factor of fifty or more, depending on the size, glass type, index [[Refractive index|homogeneity]] quality, and availability, with [[BK7]] usually being the cheapest.  Costs for larger and/or thicker optical blanks of a given material, above 100–150&amp;nbsp;mm, usually increase faster than the physical volume due to increased blank [[Annealing (glass)|annealing]] time required to achieve acceptable index homogeneity and internal [[Birefringence|stress birefringence]] levels throughout the blank volume.  Availability of glass blanks is driven by how frequently a particular glass type is made by a given manufacturer, and can seriously affect manufacturing cost and schedule.

==Process==

Lenses can first be designed using [[Paraxial approximation|paraxial theory]] to position [[image]]s and [[Entrance pupil|pupils]], then real surfaces inserted and optimized.  Paraxial theory can be skipped in simpler cases and the lens directly optimized using real surfaces. Lenses are first designed using average [[index of refraction]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (see [[Abbe number]]) properties published in the glass manufacturer's catalog and though [[glass model]] calculations. However, the properties of the real glass blanks will vary from this ideal; index of refraction values can vary by as much as 0.0003 or more from catalog values, and dispersion can vary slightly. These changes in index and dispersion can sometimes be enough to affect the lens focus location and imaging performance in highly corrected systems.

The lens blank manufacturing process is as follows:

#The [[glass batch]] ingredients for a desired glass type are mixed in a powder state,
#the powder mixture is melted together in a furnace,
#the fluid is further mixed while molten to maximize batch homogeneity,
#poured into lens blanks and
#[[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] according to empirically determined time-temperature schedules.

The glass blank pedigree, or "melt data", can be determined for a given glass batch by making small precision [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] from various locations in the batch and measuring their index of refraction on a [[spectrometer]], typically at five or more [[wavelengths]].  Lens design programs have [[curve fitting]] routines that can fit the melt data to a selected [[Sellmeier equation|dispersion curve]], from which the index of refraction at any wavelength within the fitted wavelength range can be calculated.  A re-optimization, or "melt re-comp", can then be performed on the lens design using measured index of refraction data where available.  When manufactured, the resulting lens performance will more closely match the desired requirements than if average glass catalog values for index of refraction were assumed.

Delivery schedules are impacted by glass and mirror blank availability and lead times to acquire, the amount of tooling a shop must fabricate prior to starting on a project, the manufacturing tolerances on the parts (tighter tolerances mean longer fab times), the complexity of any [[optical coatings]] that must be applied to the finished parts, further complexities in mounting or bonding lens elements into cells and in the overall lens system assembly, and any post-assembly alignment and quality control testing and tooling required.  Tooling costs and delivery schedules can be reduced by using existing tooling at any given shop wherever possible, and by maximizing manufacturing tolerances to the extent possible.

==Lens optimization==
A simple two-element air-spaced lens has nine variables (four radii of curvature, two thicknesses, one airspace thickness, and two glass types).  A multi-configuration lens corrected over a wide spectral band and field of view over a range of [[focal length]]s and over a realistic temperature range can have a complex design volume having over one hundred dimensions.

Lens optimization techniques that can navigate this multi-dimensional space and proceed to local [[Maxima and minima|minima]] have been studied since the 1940s, beginning with early work by [[James G. Baker]], and later by Feder,&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Feder, "Automatic Optical Design," Appl. Opt. 2, 1209–1226 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Wynne,&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Wynne and P. Wormell, "Lens Design by Computer," Appl. Opt. 2:1223–1238 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Glatzel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html |title=Dr. Erhardt Glatzel (Biography) |accessdate=July 21, 2013 |publisher=The Zeiss Historica Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127182506/http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html |archivedate=January 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey&lt;ref&gt;Grey, D.S., "The Inclusion of Tolerance Sensitivities in the Merit Function for Lens Optimization", SPIE Vol. 147, pp. 63–65, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.  Prior to the development of [[digital computer]]s, lens optimization was a hand-calculation task using [[trigonometric]] and [[logarithm]]ic tables to plot 2-D cuts through the multi-dimensional space. Computerized ray tracing allows the performance of a lens to be modelled quickly, so that the design space can be searched rapidly. This allows design concepts to be rapidly refined. In most cases the designer must first choose a viable design for the optical system, and then numerical modelling is used to refine it.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2008), pp. 171–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The designer ensures that designs optimized by the computer meet all requirements, and makes adjustments or restarts the process when they do not.

'''Planetary science''' or, more rarely, '''planetology''', is the scientific study of [[planet]]s (including [[Earth]]), [[Natural satellite|moons]], and [[planetary system]]s (in particular those of the [[Solar System]]) and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from [[micrometeoroid]]s to [[gas giant]]s, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] field, originally growing from [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]],&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; but which now incorporates many disciplines, including [[planetary geology]] (together with [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]]), [[cosmochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], [[hydrology]], [[theoretical planetary science]], [[glaciology]], and [[exoplanetology]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;{{cite journal

|bibcode = 2004Natur.430..509T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied disciplines include [[space physics]], when concerned with the effects of the [[Sun]] on the bodies of the Solar System, and [[astrobiology]].

There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.

Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. In the case of some exclusive planetary scientists, many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter, they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks.

==History==
The history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying &lt;blockquote&gt;The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.&lt;ref name="Philosophumena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&amp;printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation "that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface" suggested that it and other worlds might appear "just like the face of the Earth itself".&lt;ref name="Taylor1994b"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/369196a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].

The Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,&lt;ref name="SternPlanetarySoc09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.

==Disciplines==

===Planetary astronomy===
This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

Theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

=== Planetary geology ===
{{main|Planetary geology}}
{{see also|Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Icy moon}}

The best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the Earth: the [[Moon]], and the two neighbouring planets: [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Of these, the Moon was studied first, using methods developed earlier on the Earth.

==== Geomorphology ====
{{main|Geomorphology}}

Geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation, inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface. Planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features:
* Impact features (multi-ringed basins, craters)
* Volcanic and tectonic features (lava flows, fissures, [[rille]]s)
* [[Space weathering]] - erosional effects generated by the harsh environment of space (continuous micro meteorite bombardment, high-energy particle rain, [[impact gardening]]). For example, the thin dust cover on the surface of the [[moon|lunar]] [[regolith]] is a result of micro meteorite bombardment.
* Hydrological features: the liquid involved can range from water to [[hydrocarbon]] and [[ammonia]], depending on the location within the Solar System.

The history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.
{{further|Geology of the Moon}}

====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====
{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}

One of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.

The different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].

The comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.

During the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years –&lt;ref&gt;{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}&lt;/ref&gt; as of
April 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.
Eleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese
Antarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to
50&amp;nbsp;kg.

====Geophysics====
{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}
Space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.

Geophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].

{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}&lt;!-- used by incoming redirect --&gt;
Planetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.

===Atmospheric science===
{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}
[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]
The [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&amp;nbsp;— too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

The effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.

==Comparative planetary science==

{{main|Comparative planetary science}}

Planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.

The main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27970">'''Renewable heat''' is an application of [[renewable energy]] and it refers to the renewable generation of heat, rather than electrical power (e.g. replacing a fossil fuel boiler using [[concentrating solar thermal]] to feed radiators). Renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels, solar heating, geothermal heating, heat pumps and heat exchangers to recover lost heat. Significant attention is also applied to insulation.

Many colder countries consume more energy for heating than electrical power. For example, in 2005 the United Kingdom consumed 354&amp;nbsp;TWh&lt;ref&gt;Department of Trade and Industry report [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf UK Energy in Brief July 2007, Page 25] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233923/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39881.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; of electric power, but had a heat requirement of 907&amp;nbsp;TWh, the majority of which (81%) was met using gas. The residential sector alone consumed a massive 550&amp;nbsp;TWh of energy for heating, mainly in the form of gas. Almost half of the final energy consumed in the UK (49%) was in the form of heat, of which 70% was used by households and in commercial and public buildings. Households used heat mainly for space heating (69%) and heating water.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government Call for Evidence on Heat, Office of Climate Change, Jan 2008 [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf 'Heat Call for Evidence', Paragraphs 11 and 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233914/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43609.pdf |date=May 27, 2008 }} (URL accessed May, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation's approach to energy and environment policy. Few renewable technologies (whether for heat, electricity or transport) are competitive with fossil fuels without some form of carbon valuation or subsidy. In those countries, such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, where [[government intervention]] has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation (i.e. carbon and [[energy tax]]es), renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption. In those countries, such as Germany, Spain, the USA, and the UK, where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies, uses and scales, the  contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support, and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption.

== Leading renewable heat technologies ==

=== Solar heating ===
[[Solar heating]] is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure. The heat can be used for both [[space heating]] (see [[solar air heat]]) and [[water heating]] (see [[solar hot water]]). Solar heating design is divided into two groups:
* [[Passive solar]] heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect heat. [[Passive solar building design]] must also consider the storage and distribution of heat, which may be accomplished passively, or use air ducting to draw heat actively to the foundation of the building for storage. One such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to {{convert|24|C|F}} on a partially sunny winter day (-7&amp;nbsp;°C or 19&amp;nbsp;°F), and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building's heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarhouseproject.com/index.html |title=Solar House, Solar Home, Solar Homes, Solar Houses |publisher=Solarhouseproject.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home cost $125 per square foot (or 370&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at $1,351/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), similar to the cost of a traditional new home.
* [[Active solar]] heating uses [[pump]]s to move air or a liquid from the [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] into the building or storage area. Applications such as [[solar air heat]]ing and [[solar water heating]] typically capture solar heat in panels which can then be used for applications such as space heating and supplementation of residential water heaters. In contrast to [[photovoltaic panels]], which are used to generate electricity, solar heating panels are less expensive and capture a much higher proportion of the sun's energy.
Solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system, either conventional or renewable.

=== Geothermal heating ===
[[File:Hot Spring.jpg|thumb|right|Hot Springs located in Nevada.]]
[[Geothermal energy]] is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil. Geothermal energy is an enormous, underused heat and power resource that is clean (emits little or no greenhouse gases), reliable (average system availability of 95%), and homegrown (making populations less dependent on oil).&lt;ref name="EERE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|title=Geothermal Basics Overview|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html|archivedate=2008-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth absorbs the sun's energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground. The ground temperature remains constant at a point of {{convert|42|to|100|F|C}} all year round depending on where you live on earth. A geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the Earth's surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings. The system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground, connected to pipes in a building. A pump circulates liquid through the circuit. In the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building. In the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |title=What is Geothermal? - Geothermal Resources Council |publisher=Geothermal.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004048/http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat pumps===
[[Heat pump]]s use work to move heat from one place to another, and can be used for both heating and air conditioning. Though capital intensive, heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity. Two common types of heat pump are [[air-source heat pump]]s (ASHP) and [[ground-source heat pump]]s (GSHP), depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground.  Air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about -15&amp;nbsp;°C, while ground-source heat pumps are not affected. The efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the [[coefficient of performance]] (CoP): For every unit of electricity used to pump the heat, an air source heat pump generates 2.5 to 3 units of heat (i.e. it has a CoP of 2.5 to 3), whereas a GSHP generates 3 to 3.5 units of heat. Based on current fuel prices for the United Kingdom, assuming a CoP of 3-4, a GSHP is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric, oil, and solid fuel heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps Ground Source Heat Pumps: Costs, savings and financial support] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202165420/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewable-energy/heat/ground-source-heat-pumps |date=December 2, 2016 }} Retrieved 2016-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps can be linked to an inter[[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (hot or cold), doubling the CoP from 4 to 8 by extracting heat from warmer ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/gshp.html |title=GSHP &amp;#124; Ground Source Heat Pumps &amp;#124; GSHPs &amp;#124; Ground Source Heating &amp;#124; Coefficient of Performance CoP &amp;#124; Ground source heat pump efficiency &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interseasonal heat transfer====
{{Main|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
A heat pump with Interseasonal Heat Transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html |title=Thermal Banks store heat between seasons &amp;#124; Seasonal Heat Storage &amp;#124; ThermalBanks from ICAX save carbon emissions &amp;#124; Thermal Energy Storage using Inter seasonal Heat Stores &amp;#124; Underground Thermal Energy Storage UTES &amp;#124; Reusable Heat |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter. This reduces the "Lift" needed and doubles the CoP of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground.

====CoP and lift====
A heat pump CoP increases as the temperature difference, or "Lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The CoP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g., underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g., the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional radiators require high water temperatures, affecting the choice of heat pump technology. Low temperature radiators provide an alternative to conventional radiators.

===Resistive electrical heating===
Renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and by burning biomass. In a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive, [[Electric heating|resistance heating]] is common. In countries like Denmark where electricity is expensive, it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/DEA_Heat_supply_in_denmark.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity, [[storage heater]]s consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day.

=== Wood-pellet heating ===
[[File:Lincoln stove.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Stove.]][[File:Pellets hand.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Pellets.]]
[[Wood-pellet heating]] and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid, typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal. Solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space, and the specialized heating systems can be expensive (though grant schemes are available in many European countries to offset this capital cost.) Low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in Europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than 3 to 5 years.  Because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios, or for premises connected to the gas grid (though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive.) There is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat, especially the fine particulates.

=== Wood-stove heating ===
Burning [[wood fuel]] in an open fire is both extremely inefficient (0-20%) and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion. In the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing, an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building.

Modern wood [[stove]] designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction. In the United States, new wood stoves are certified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and burn cleaner and more efficiently (the overall efficiency is 60-80%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/bns/reports/stakejun2008/B%28a%29P/WoodstoveFacsheet_08.pdf|title=Burn clean: Hot tips for a better fire|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- originally at 
http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf, and archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20090510060711/http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/pdfs/epa_bcflyer_press_rev4.pdf should this link ever become stale --&gt; and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building.

"Cleaner" should not, however, be confused with clean. An Australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current Australian standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/atmosphere/airquality/publications/emission-factor.html |title=Measurement of real-world PM10 emission factors and emission profiles from woodheaters by in situ source monitoring and atmospheric verification methods |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that particle emissions averaged 9.4&amp;nbsp;g/kg wood burned (range 2.6 to 21.7).  A heater with average wood consumption of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6&amp;nbsp;kg of PM2.5, i.e. particles less than 2.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]]. This can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current [[European emission standards|Euro 5 standards]] (introduced September 2009) of 0.005&amp;nbsp;g/km. So one new wood heater emits as much PM2.5 per year as 367 passenger cars each driving 20,000&amp;nbsp;km a year. A recent European study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |title=Assessment of the health impacts of exposure to PM2.5 at a European levelETC/ACC Technical Paper 2009/1 |publisher=Air-climate.eionet.europa.eu |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722210417/http://air-climate.eionet.europa.eu/reports/ETCACC_TP_2009_1_European_PM2.5_HIA |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified PM2.5 as the most health-hazardous air pollutant, causing an estimated 492,000 premature deaths.  The next worst pollutant, ozone, is responsible for 21,000 premature deaths.

Because of the problems with pollution, the Australian Lung Foundation recommends using alternative means for climate control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lungfoundation.com.au/consultation-looks-at-reducing-emissions-from-wood-heaters/]{date=2014-06-01}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Lung Association "strongly recommends using cleaner, less toxic sources of heat. Converting a wood-burning fireplace or stove to use either natural gas or propane will eliminate exposure to the dangerous toxins wood burning generates including dioxin, arsenic and formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lungusa.org/press-room/press-releases/cleaner-alternatives-for-winter-heat.html |title=American Lung Association Cautions Against Wood-burning and Urges Cleaner Alternatives for Winter Heat - American Lung Association |publisher=Lungusa.org |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Renewable" should not be confused with "greenhouse neutral".  A recent peer-reviewed paper found that, even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply, [[methane emissions]] from a typical Australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global warming than heating the same house with gas.  However, because a large proportion of firewood sold in Australia is not from sustainable supplies, Australian households that use wood heating often cause more global warming than heating three similar homes with gas.&lt;ref&gt;"Australian wood heaters currently increase global warming and health costs", Dorothy L. Robinson, Atmospheric Poolution Research, Article in Press, {{doi|10.5094/APR.2011.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High efficiency stoves should meet the following design criteria:
* Well sealed and precisely calibrated to draw a low yet sufficient volume of air. Air-flow restriction is critical; a lower inflow of cold air cools the furnace less (a higher temperature is thus achieved). It also allows greater time for extraction of heat from the [[exhaust gas]], and draws less heat from the building.
* The furnace must be well insulated to increase combustion temperature, and thus completeness.
* A well insulated furnace radiates little heat. Thus heat must be extracted instead from the exhaust gas duct. Heat absorption efficiencies are higher when the heat-exchange duct is longer, and when the flow of exhaust gas is slower.
* In many designs, the heat-exchange duct is built of a very large mass of heat-absorbing brick or stone. This design causes the absorbed heat to be emitted over a longer period - typically a day.

===Renewable natural gas===
[[Renewable natural gas]] is defined as gas obtained from [[biomass]] which is upgraded to a quality similar to [[natural gas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgc.dk/publikationer/konference/jkj_sustain_gas.pdf|publisher=Dgc.dk|title='Sustainable Gas Enters the European Gas Distribution System'|accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Energy research Centre of the Netherlands, renewable natural gas is 'cheaper than alternatives where biomass is used in a combined heat and power plant or local combustion plant'.&lt;ref&gt;Energy research Centre of the Netherlands [http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2005/rx05187.pdf 'Heat from Biomass via Synthetic Natural Gas'] . Retrieved March 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy unit costs are lowered through 'favourable scale and operating hours', and end-user capital costs eliminated through distribution via the existing gas grid.

==Energy efficiency==
Renewable heat goes hand in hand with energy efficiency. Indeed, renewable heating projects depend heavily for their success on energy efficiency; in the case of solar heating to cut reliance on the requirement supplementary heating, in the case of wood fuel heating to cut the cost of wood purchased and volume stored, and in the case of heat pumps to reduce the size and investment in heat pump, heat sink and electricity costs.

Two main types of improvement can be made to a building's energy efficiency:

===Insulation===
Improvements to insulation can cut energy consumption greatly, making a space cheaper to heat and to cool. However existing housing can often be difficult or expensive to improve. Newer buildings can benefit from many of the techniques of [[superinsulation]]. Older buildings can benefit from several kinds of improvement:

* '''Solid wall insulation''': A building with solid walls can benefit from internal or external insulation. External wall insulation involves adding decorative weather-proof insulating panels or other treatment to the outside of the wall. Alternatively, internal wall insulation can be applied using ready-made insulation/plaster board laminates, or other methods. Thicknesses of internal or external insulation typically range between 50 and 100&amp;nbsp;mm.
* '''Cavity wall insulation''': A building with cavity walls can benefit from insulation pumped into the cavity. This form of insulation is very cost effective{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.
* '''[[Programmable thermostat]]s''' allow heating and cooling of a room to be switched off depending the time, day of the week, and temperature. A bedroom, for example, does not need to be heated during the day, but a living room does not need to be heated during the night.
* '''Roof insulation'''
* '''Insulated windows and doors'''
* '''Draught proofing'''

=== Underfloor heating ===
[[Underfloor heating]] may sometimes be more energy efficient than traditional methods of heating:

* Water circulates within the system at low temperatures (35&amp;nbsp;°C - 50&amp;nbsp;°C) making gas boilers, wood fired boilers, and heat pumps significantly more efficient.
* Rooms with underfloor heating are cooler near the ceiling, where heat is not required, but warmer underfoot, where comfort is most required.
* Traditional radiators are frequently positioned underneath poorly insulated windows, heating them unnecessarily.

=== Waste-water heat recovery ===
[[File:Hot water heat recycling unit.jpg|thumb|right|Recycling heat.]]
It is possible to recover significant amounts of heat from waste hot water via [[hot water heat recycling]]. Major consumption of hot water is sinks, showers, baths, dishwashers, and clothes washers. On average 30% of a property's domestic hot water is used for showering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47685.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming fresh water is typically of a far lower temperature than the waste water from a shower. An inexpensive heat exchanger recovers up on average 40% of the heat that would normally be wasted, by warming incoming cold fresh water with heat from outgoing waste water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">The '''Rossiter–McLaughlin effect''' is a [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] phenomenon observed when either an [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary's]] secondary star or an [[extrasolar planet]] is seen to [[astronomical transit|transit]] across the face of the primary or parent star. As the main star rotates on its axis, one quadrant of its [[photosphere]] will be seen to be coming towards the viewer, and the other visible quadrant to be moving away. These motions produce [[blueshift]]s and [[redshift]]s, respectively, in the star's [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]], usually observed as a broadening of the [[spectral line]]s. When the secondary star or planet transits the primary, it blocks part of the latter's disc, preventing some of the shifted light from reaching the observer. This causes the observed mean redshift of the primary star as a whole to vary from its normal value. As the transiting object moves across to the other side of the star's disc, the redshift anomaly will switch from being negative to being positive, or vice versa.  This effect has been used to show that as many as 25% of [[hot jupiter|hot Jupiters]] are orbiting in a retrograde direction with respect to their parent stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triaud |first=A. H. M. J. |display-authors=etal |year=2010 |title=Spin-orbit angle measurements for six southern transiting planets: New insights into the dynamical origins of hot Jupiters |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=524 |issue= |pages=A25 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201014525 |arxiv=1008.2353 |bibcode = 2010A&amp;A...524A..25T }}&lt;/ref&gt; strongly suggesting that dynamical interactions rather than [[planetary migration]] produce these objects.

[[Image:Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.svg|frame|center|Illustration showing the effect. The viewer is situated at the bottom. Light from the anticlockwise-rotating star is blue-shifted on the approaching side, and red-shifted on the receding side. As the planet passes in front of the star it sequentially blocks blue- and red-shifted light, causing the star's apparent radial velocity to change when it in fact does not.]]

== History ==
J. R. Holt in 1893 proposed a method to measure the [[stellar rotation]] of stars using [[radial velocity]] measurements, he predicted that when one star of an eclipsing binary eclipsed the other it would first cover the advancing blueshifted half and then the receding redshifted half. This motion would create a [[redshift]] of the eclipsed star’s spectrum followed by a [[blueshift]], thus appearing as a change in the radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsed star.&lt;ref name="Triaud2013"/&gt;

The effect is named after [[Richard Alfred Rossiter]] and [[Dean Benjamin McLaughlin]].

In [[software engineering]], '''software configuration management''' ('''SCM''' or '''S/W CM''')&lt;ref&gt;Atria (later [[Rational Software]], now a part of [[International Business Machines|IBM]])&lt;/ref&gt; is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of [[configuration management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach | edition = 7th International | author = Roger S. Pressman | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCM practices include [[revision control]] and the establishment of [[baseline (configuration management)|baselines]].  If something goes wrong, SCM can determine what was changed and who changed it.  If a configuration is working well, SCM can determine how to replicate it across many hosts.

The acronym "SCM" is also expanded as '''source configuration management process''' and '''software change and configuration management'''.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner and Forrester Research&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "configuration" is generally understood to cover changes typically made by a [[system administrator]].

==Purposes==
{{Prose|section|date=June 2014}}
The goals of SCM are generally:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

*Configuration identification - Identifying configurations, [[configuration item]]s and [[baseline (configuration management)|baselines]].
*Configuration control - Implementing a [[change control|controlled change]] process. This is usually achieved by setting up a [[change control board]] whose primary function is to approve or reject all change requests that are sent against any baseline.
*Configuration status accounting - Recording and reporting all the necessary information on the status of the development process.
*Configuration auditing - Ensuring that configurations contain all their intended parts and are sound with respect to their specifying documents, including requirements, architectural specifications and user manuals.
*[[Build management]] - Managing the process and tools used for builds.
*[[Process management]] - Ensuring adherence to the organization's development process.
*Environment management - Managing the software and hardware that host the system.
*[[Teamwork]] - Facilitate team interactions related to the process.
*Defect tracking - Making sure every defect has traceability back to the source.

With the introduction of [[cloud computing]] the purposes of SCM tools have become merged in some cases.  The SCM tools themselves have become virtual appliances that can be instantiated as virtual machines and saved with state and version.  The tools can model and manage cloud-based virtual resources, including virtual appliances, storage units, and software bundles.  The roles and responsibilities of the actors have become merged as well with developers now being able to dynamically instantiate virtual servers and related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amies | first=A |author2=Peddle S |author3=Pan T M |author4=Zou P X | title = Develop cloud applications with Rational tools | journal = IBM developerWorks | publisher = IBM | date = June 5, 2012 | url = https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/iaas_cloud/entry/develop_cloud_applications_with_rational_tools3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of software configuration management (SCM) in computing can be traced back as early as the 1950s, when CM (for Configuration Management), originally for hardware development and production control, was being applied to software development. Early software had a physical footprint, such as [[Punched card|cards]], [[Punched tape|tapes]], and other media. The first software configuration management was a manual operation. With the advances in language and complexity, [[software engineering]], involving configuration management and other methods, became a major concern due to issues like schedule, budget, and quality. Practical lessons, over the years, had led to the definition, and establishment, of procedures and tools. Eventually, the tools became systems to manage software changes.&lt;ref&gt;"1988 "A Guide to Understanding Configuration Management in Trusted Systems" National Computer Security System (via [https://books.google.com/books?id=CScMNjwwK8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=configuration+management+systems&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bADiUcmJFs3FqQGG4oCYDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA Google])&lt;/ref&gt; Industry-wide practices were offered as solutions, either in an open or proprietary manner (such as [[Revision Control System]]). With the growing use of computers, systems emerged that handled a broader scope, including [[requirements management]], design alternatives, quality control, and more; later tools followed the guidelines of organizations, such as the [[Capability Maturity Model]] of the [[Software Engineering Institute]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">[[Image:Survivorship Curves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|An illustration of the three idealized types of curve (logarithmic scale)]]
A '''survivorship curve''' is a [[chart|graph]] showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving to each age for a given species or group (e.g. males or females). Survivorship curves can be constructed for a given [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (a group of individuals of roughly the same age) based on a [[life table]].

There are three generalized types of survivorship curves:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712136178|title=Campbell biology|last=B.|first=Reece, Jane|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pearson Australia|isbn=9781442531765|oclc=712136178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Type I'' or convex curves are characterized by high age-specific survival probability in early and middle life, followed by a rapid decline in survival in later life. They are typical of species that produce few offspring but care for them well, including [[human]]s and many other large mammals.
* ''Type II'' or diagonal curves are an intermediate between Types I and III, where roughly constant [[mortality rate]]/survival probability is experienced regardless of age. Some [[bird]]s and some [[lizard]]s follow this pattern.
* ''Type III'' or concave curves have the greatest mortality (lowest age-specific survival) early in life, with relatively low rates of death (high probability of survival) for those surviving this bottleneck. This type of curve is characteristic of species that produce a large number of offspring (see [[r/K selection theory]]).  This includes most marine invertebrates.  For example, [[oyster]]s produce millions of eggs, but most larvae die from predation or other causes; those that survive long enough to produce a hard shell live relatively long.
The number or proportion of organisms surviving to any age is plotted on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|y-axis]] (generally with a [[logarithmic scale]] starting with 1000 individuals), while their age (often as a proportion of [[maximum life span]]) is plotted on the x-axis.

In mathematical statistics, the [[survival function]] is one specific form of survivorship curve and plays a basic part in [[survival analysis]].

There are various reasons that a species exhibits their particular survivorship curve, but one contributor can be environmental factors that decrease survival. For example, an outside element that is nondiscriminatory in the ages that it affects (of a particular species) is likely to yield a Type II survivorship curve, in which the young and old are equally likely to be affected. On the other hand, an outside element that preferentially reduces the survival of young individuals is likely to yield a Type III curve. Finally, if an outside element only reduces the survival of organisms later in life, this is likely to yield a Type I curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demetrius|first=Lloyd|date=1978-09-21|title=Adaptive value, entropy and survivorship curves|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v275/n5677/abs/275213a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=275|issue=5677|pages=213–214|doi=10.1038/275213a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Japanese-occupied Taiwan in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/nwac/body.html|title=New World Art Center|publisher=13soho.com|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a young boy, he memorized every worn page of the fifty art books that a Taiwanese dentist had smuggled in from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708095638/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HMU/is_7_34/ai_n27333360/] &lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, Chen began to study painting at a private artist studio in Taiwan. After graduating, Chen was exempted from the national admissions test and accepted by the renowned National Taiwan University where he studied English literature. Later on, Chen earned a scholarship from the French Government, and with one suitcase and $100 borrowed from a friend, he flew to Paris and spent 12 years there, becoming the first Asian to obtain a Ph.D. in Art History from the University of Paris ([[La Sorbonne]]), as well as an M.A. in French Contemporary Literature. At the same time, he studied painting for seven years at the  L’École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux -arts in Paris, researched and wrote critiques of Paris art shows.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} During this time he supported himself by washing dishes in a Chinese restaurant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Career==
In an interview with Chen stated that in 1969,while still attending La Sorbonne he established his “Five-Dimensional Universal Culture” theory and initiated his “Neo-Iconography” art style. Since then he has created over 3,000 art works in his signature style, conducted more than 200 one-man shows, and published 26 books on his art and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.artron.net/news/news.php?newid=94815&amp;column_id=63|title=Interviews of Dr. T.F. Chen's  Olympics Series Works--News-Artron.net|publisher=En.artron.net|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His artworks
have been featured in more than 300 textbooks, magazines, newspapers and other
media worldwide (such as in the widely used, university-level art history textbook
Arts &amp; Ideas).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1980, Dr. Chen gave a lecture on his “Five-Dimensional Universal Culture” theory
at the International Science Conference. In 1998 and 2000, Dr. Chen presented his thesis and exhibited his artworks at the
State of the World Forum. In 2001, the Friends of the United Nations honored Dr.
Chen with the “Global Tolerance Award,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qart.com/Chen-T.--F.-bio|title=Qart - Fine Art Gallery and Auctions|publisher=Qart.com|accessdate=4 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015005/https://www.qart.com/Chen-T.--F.-bio|archivedate=9 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed him a Cultural Ambassador of
Tolerance and Peace and invited him to organize the “Arts for Humanity World Tour”
to advance art education and a Global Culture of Peace.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==New World Art Center==
In 1996, Dr. Chen co-founded the New World Art Center and the T.F. Chen
Cultural Center a non-profit organization in SoHo, NYC – which sponsors and
conducts artistic, educational and multicultural exchange events. In 2005, in
partnership with the Friends of the United Nations, Dr. Chen then founded the
Art for Humanity Foundation to sponsor and organize the “Arts for Humanity
World Tour 2005-2010” to further advance his vision of a Global Culture of
Peace through the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/nwac/body.html|title=New World Art Center|publisher=123soho.com|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic notoriety==
Chen was considered one of the pioneers of Post-Modern Art in the 1970s and
has also been recognized as “one of the 20 most influential artists in the world today”
by Dr. [[Thomas McEvilley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123soho.com/artgroup/nwac/article1.htm#1|title=Post-Modern Art|publisher=123soho.com|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art critic.

Dr. Jan Hulsker, an expert on [[Vincent van Gogh]], called Dr. Chen “the
Reborn Van Gogh!” when he viewed Chen’s “Post – Van Gogh Series” that he had
created in celebration of the Van Gogh Centennial.

Together with [[Telecom SudParis]], IMT Business School share the [[Institut Mines-Télécom|IMT]] campus in [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]]. Almost all students are accommodated on campus.

Students from [[Telecom SudParis]] and '''Institut Mines-Télécom Business School''' share most the student life aspects during their life on campus : shared apartments, shared student associations, shared classes and pedagogical programmes such as the famous Challenge Projets d'Entreprendre, a one-week competition which has, since its first edition in 2000, inspired many other business schools to build their own "startup creation challenges" programmes.

'''Tin-glazed pottery'''&lt;ref&gt;''Maiolica'', [[C. Drury E. Fortnum]], 1875, p.12“&lt;/ref&gt; is [[earthenware]] covered in [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] containing [[tin oxide]] which is white, shiny and opaque (see [[tin-glazing]] for the chemistry); usually this provides a background for brightly painted decoration.  It has been important in [[Islamic pottery|Islamic]] and European [[pottery]], but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff-colored [[earthenware]] and the white glaze imitated [[Chinese porcelain]].  The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the unfired glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly [[cobalt oxide]], [[copper (II) oxide|copper oxide]], [[iron oxide]], [[manganese dioxide]] and [[antimony]] oxide.  The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late [[Renaissance]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, the oldest fragments having been excavated during the [[First World War]] from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=Caiger1973&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-glazed Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'' (Faber and Faber, 1973) {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in the [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.

The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as [[creamware]] by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], and icreasingly cheap [[Porcelain#European porcelain|European porcelain]] and [[Chinese export porcelain]], reduced the demand for tin-glaze [[Delftware]], [[faience]] and [[majolica]].

The rise in the cost of tin oxide during the First World War led to its partial substitution by [[zirconium]] compounds in the glaze.

==Names==
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Tin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names.  The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as ''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called ''[[maiolica]]'', sometimes pronounced and spelt ''majolica'' by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as ''[[delftware]]'' as much of it was made in the town of [[Delft]]. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as ''[[English Delftware|English delftware]]'' or ''galleyware''. In France it was known as ''[[faience]]''.

The word ''maiolica'' is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for [[Majorca]], an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish ''obra de Mallequa'', the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term ''maiolica'' was adopted for Italian-made [[lusterware|luster pottery]] copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among  the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation ''majolica''. The [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] pottery copied it and applied the term ''majolica ware'' to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful [[lead-glazed earthenware]] which they called ''[[Palissy ware]]'', soon also to become known as ''majolica''. So now we have two distinct products with the same name. "In the 1870s, the curators of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/  Victoria and Albert Museum, "Ceramics - M is for Maiolica/majolica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the article about 19th century lead-glazed earthenware, see [[Victorian majolica]]''

W.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], 1938–1950) wrote of ''maiolica'' that, "By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition … the name faïence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition."&lt;ref name=Honey&gt;Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''maiolica'' is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The New Maiolica'' by Matthias Osterman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hispano-Moresque ware==
{{main|Hispano-Moresque ware}}

[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|A Hispano-Moresque dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram "IHS", decorated in cobalt blue and gold luster.  Valencia, c. 1430–1500.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]
The [[Moors]] introduced tin-glazed pottery to Spain after the conquest of 711.

Hispano-Moresque ware is generally distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration,&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; though as the dish illustrated shows, it was also made for the Christian market.

Hispano-Moresque shapes of the 15th century included the ''[[albarello]]'' (a tall jar), luster dishes with [[Coat of Arms|coats of arms]], made for wealthy Italians and Spaniards, jugs, some on high feet (the ''citra'' and the ''grealet''), a deep-sided dish (the ''lebrillo de alo'') and the eared bowl (''cuenco de oreja'').

With the Spanish conquest of [[Mexico]], tin-glazed pottery came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of the ceramics imported from [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Lister&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Moors were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century, the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia.  Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster.

==Maiolica==
{{main|Maiolica}}

[[File:albarello.JPG|thumb|right|An albarello (drug jar) from Venice or Castel Durante, 16th century.  Approx 30cm high.  Decorated in cobalt blue, copper green, antimony yellow and yellow ochre.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]The 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Such archaic wares&lt;ref&gt;Blake&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes dubbed ''proto-maiolica''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;  During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. ''Sgraffito'' wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.

Refined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the ''contada'' of [[Florence]].  The city itself declined in importance in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local [[deforestation]]. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.  Production scattered among small communes&lt;ref&gt;Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]], none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; and, after the mid-15th century, at [[Faenza]], [[Arezzo]] and [[Siena]]. Faenza, which gave its name to [[faience]], was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite p.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bologna]] produced lead-glazed wares for export.  [[Orvieto]] and [[Deruta]] both produced ''maioliche'' in the 15th century.  In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at [[Castel Durante]], [[Urbino]], [[Gubbio]] and [[Pesaro]].  Some maiolica was produced as far north as [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Turin]] and as far south as [[Palermo]] and [[Caltagirone]] in Sicily.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Savona]] began to be a prominent place of manufacture.

Some of the principal centers of production (e.g. [[Deruta]] and [[Montelupo Fiorentino|Montelupo]]) still produce maiolica, which is sold in quantity in Italian tourist areas.

==Delftware==
{{main|Delftware}}

Delftware was made in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;  Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

The [[Guild of St. Luke]], to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

From about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to [[cobalt]] blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor [[Wan-Li]] in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

Delftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with [[windmills]] and [[fishing]] [[boat]]s, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Delftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.

By the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.

There are good collections of old Delftware in the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

==English delftware==

{{main|English Delftware}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ajvdelft.jpg|thumb|English delftware drug jar circa 1720-40 (copyright ajv private collection)|{{puic|1=Ajvdelft.jpg|log=2009 February 28}}]] --&gt;English delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century.  The main centers of production were [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]] with smaller centers at [[Wincanton]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Dublin]].

[[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in [[Norwich]], where they made "Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; In 1579 Jansen applied to [[Queen Elizabeth I]] for the sole right to practice "galleypotting" in London and soon set up a workshop at [[Aldgate]] to the east of the city.  There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in [[Southwark]] recorded in 1571 as "painters of pottes".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

English delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: "...&amp;nbsp;there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.51. Caiger-Smith describes its mood as "ingenuous, direct, sometimes eccentric", and Garner talks of its "quite distinctive character".&lt;/ref&gt; Its methods and techniques were less sophisticated than those of its continental counterparts.

The earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the London Museum. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, "THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers. Blue-dash chargers, usually between about 25 and 35&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter with abstract, floral, religious, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/cbr5.html patriotic] or [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps337952.jpg&amp;retpage=20594 topographical]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} motifs, were produced in quantity by London and Bristol potters until the early 18th century.  As they were kept for decoration on walls, dressers and side-tables, many have survived and they are well represented in museum collections.

Smaller and more everyday wares were also made: paving tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/keg.html posset pots], salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups,&lt;ref&gt;Ale mugs joined in groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker.&lt;/ref&gt; puzzle jugs,&lt;ref&gt;Similar to fuddling cups,&lt;/ref&gt; barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, [[porringer]]s, and [http://www.antiquedelft.com/mrw.html flower bricks].

Towards the end of the 17th century, changing taste led to the replacement of apothecary pots, paving tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, [[punch (drink)|punch bowls]], teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots.

There are good examples of English delftware in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

==Faience==
{{main|Faience}}
[[File:Faience-luneville-saint-clement.jpg|thumb|right|Faience of [[Lunéville]]]]
In France, the first well-known painter of faïence was [[Masseot Abaquesne]], established in Rouen in the 1530s. Other centres of faience manufacturing developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] in Brittany [https://web.archive.org/web/20050413214248/http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html], which today possesses a museum devoted to faience, and followed by [[Nevers]], [[Moustiers-Sainte-Marie|Moustiers]] and [[Marseille]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lunéville]].

The products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], and the style of decoration, ''faïence blanche'' being left in its undecorated fired white slip. ''Faïence parlante'' bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. [[Apothecary]] wares, including ''[[albarello|albarelli]]'', can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the ''faïence patriotique'' that was a specialty of the years of the [[French Revolution]].

Popular and folk forms have continued in many countries, including the Mexican [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]].

In the 20th century there were changes in the formulation of tin-glaze and several artist potters began to work in the medium of tin-glazed pottery.

The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1918-1918 war and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology'', J.R. Taylor &amp; A.C. Bull, The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more "clinical" than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers'', K. Shaw, A.H. &amp; A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; with up to 6% used in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanitaryware'', D. Fortuna, Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a., Florence, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramic Glazes'', F. Singer &amp; W.L. German, Borax Consolidated Limited, London, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

In England at the end of the nineteenth century, [[William de Morgan]] re-discovered the technique of firing luster on tin-glaze "to an extraordinarily high standard".&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cremona, J. and Andreis, T., ''Buongiorno Italia!'', London: BBC Books, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Roger Fry]], [[Vanessa Bell]]  and [[Duncan Grant]] decorated tin-glazed pottery for the [[Omega Workshops]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at [[Vallauris]] in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]], London, [[Dora Billington]] encouraged her students, including [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]] and [[Alan Caiger-Smith]], to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, [[Nicholas Vergette]] and others including the [[Rye Pottery]] made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards [[stoneware]]. Subsequently, Caiger-Smith experimented with the technique of reduced lustre on tin glaze, which had been practiced in Italy until 1700 and Spain until 1800 and had then been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World''(Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caiger-Smith trained several potters at his Aldermaston Pottery and published ''Tin-glaze Pottery'' which gives a history of maiolica, delftware and faience in Europe and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;'Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware.' A. Caiger-Smith. ''Faber and Faber,'' London. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A selection of tin glaze pottery by contemporary Studio potters is given ''Tin-glazed Earthenware'' by Daphne Carnegy.&lt;ref&gt;'Tin-glazed Earthenware.'

'''Trial and error''' is a fundamental method of [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary Epistemology, Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge p94 p108&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary p1489&lt;/ref&gt; or until the agent stops trying.

According to [[W.H. Thorpe]], the term was [[neologism|devised]] by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] (1852–1936) after trying out similar phrases "trial and failure" and "trial and practice".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe W.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London &amp; Praeger, New York. p26. {{ISBN|978-0-03-053251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Morgan's Canon]], [[ethology|animal behaviour]] should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial-and-error learning. An example is the skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

[[Edward Thorndike]] showed how to manage a trial-and-error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the [[law of effect]] in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1898. Animal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in animals. ''Psychological Monographs'' #8.&lt;/ref&gt; He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[operant conditioning]].

Trial and error is also a [[heuristic]] method of problem solving, [[repair]], tuning, or obtaining [[knowledge]]. In the field of [[computer science]], the method is called '''generate and test'''. In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is '''"guess and check"'''.

This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem solving, contrasted with an approach using [[insight]] and [[theory]]. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as ''guided empiricism''.

==Methodology==
This approach is far more successful with simple problems and in games, and is often resorted to when no apparent rule applies. This does not mean that the approach need be careless, for an individual can be methodical in manipulating the variables in an attempt to sort through possibilities that may result in success. Nevertheless, this method is often used by people who have little knowledge in the problem area. The trial-and-error approach has been studied from its natural computational point of view &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1183v2 X. Bei, N. Chen, S. Zhang, On the Complexity of Trial and Error, STOC 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplest applications===
[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1960, section 11/5) offers three simple strategies for dealing with the same basic exercise-problem; and they have very different efficiencies:
Suppose there are 1000 on/off switches which have to be set to a particular combination by random-based testing, each test to take one second. [This is also discussed in Traill (1978/2006, section C1.2]. The strategies are:
*the perfectionist all-or-nothing method, with no attempt at holding partial successes. This would be expected to take more than 10^301 seconds, [i.e. 2^1000 seconds, or 3·5×(10^291) centuries!];
*a serial-test of switches, holding on to the partial successes (assuming that these are manifest) would take 500 seconds on average; while
*a parallel-but-individual testing of all switches simultaneously would take only one second.

Note the tacit assumption here that no intelligence or insight is brought to bear on the problem. However, the existence of different available strategies allows us to consider a separate ("superior") domain of processing — a ''"meta-level"'' above the mechanics of switch handling — where the various available strategies can be randomly chosen. Once again this is "trial and error", but of a different type. This leads us to:

===Hierarchies===
Ashby's book develops this "meta-level" idea, and extends it into a whole [[recursion|recursive]] sequence of levels, successively above each other in a systematic hierarchy. On this basis he argues that human intelligence emerges from such organization: relying heavily on trial-and-error (at least initially at each new stage), but emerging with what we would call "intelligence" at the end of it all. Thus presumably the topmost level of the hierarchy (at any stage) will still depend on simple trial-and-error.

Traill (1978/2006) suggests that this Ashby-hierarchy probably coincides with [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s well-known theory of developmental stages. [This work also discusses Ashby's 1000-switch example; see §C1.2]. After all, it is part of Piagetian doctrine that children learn by first ''actively doing'' in a more-or-less random way, and then hopefully learn from the consequences — which all has a certain to Ashby's random "trial-and-error".

===Application===
Traill (2008, ''espec. Table "S" on p.31'') follows [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Jerne]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in seeing this strategy as probably underlying ''all'' knowledge-gathering systems — ''at least in their initial phase''.

Four such systems are identified:
*[[Natural selection]] which "educates" the [[DNA]] of the species,
*The brain of the individual (just discussed);
*The "brain" of society-as-such (including the publicly held body of science); and
*The [[adaptive immune system]].

===Intention===
In the Ashby-and-[[Cybernetics]] tradition, the word "trial" usually implies ''random-or-arbitrary'', without any ''deliberate'' choice.

However amongst non-cyberneticians, "trial" will often imply a deliberate subjective act by some adult human agent; (e.g. in a court-room, or laboratory). So that has sometimes led to confusion.

Of course the situation becomes even more confusing if one accepts Ashby's hierarchical explanation of intelligence, and its implied ability to be deliberate and to creatively [[design]] — all based ultimately on ''non-deliberate'' actions. The lesson here seems to be that one must simply be careful to clarify the meaning of one's own words, and indeed the words of others. [Incidentally it seems that ''consciousness'' is not an essential ingredient for ''intelligence'' as discussed                  
 
One of the greatest inventor with 1093 patents was Thomas Alva Edison (TAE). One of his most famous sayings was that "Genius was 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration".  Edison and his assistants would tried 500 ways to invent something and when not succeesful, they would try another 500 ways. When an experiment was not successful, he was happy to admit that he now knew the things that did not work. Trial and error was Edison's most successful means of invention. Most today believe Edison did not follow a scientific theory to invent but invented by: Trial And Error (TAE). 

Today, the approach of [[voodoo programming]] is an usage where code is composed with trial and error until something which produces the desired output is found.

==Features==
Trial and error has a number of features:
*solution-oriented: trial and error makes no attempt to discover ''why'' a solution works, merely that it ''is'' a solution.
*problem-specific: trial and error makes no attempt to generalize a solution to other problems.
*non-optimal: trial and error is generally an attempt to find ''a'' solution, not ''all'' solutions, and not the ''best'' solution.
*needs little knowledge: trials and error can proceed where there is little or no knowledge of the subject.

It is possible to use trial and error to find all solutions or the best solution, when a testably finite number of possible solutions exist. To find all solutions, one simply makes a note and continues, rather than ending the process, when a solution is found, until all solutions have been tried. To find the best solution, one finds all solutions by the method just described and then comparatively evaluates them based upon some predefined set of criteria, the existence of which is a condition for the possibility of finding a best solution. (Also, when only one solution can exist, as in assembling a jigsaw puzzle, then any solution found is the only solution and so is necessarily the best.)

==Examples==
Trial and error has traditionally been the main method of finding new drugs, such as [[antibiotics]]. [[Chemist]]s simply try chemicals at random until they find one with the desired effect. In a more sophisticated version, chemists select a narrow range of chemicals it is thought may have some effect using a technique called [[structure-activity relationship]]. (The latter case can be alternatively considered as a changing of the problem rather than of the solution strategy: instead of "What chemical will work well as an antibiotic?" the problem in the sophisticated approach is "Which, if any, of the chemicals in this narrow range will work well as an antibiotic?") The method is used widely in many disciplines, such as [[polymer technology]] to find new polymer types or families.

Trial and error is also commonly seen in player responses to [[Video game|video games]] - when faced with an obstacle or [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], players often form a number of strategies to surpass the obstacle or defeat the boss, with each strategy being carried out before the player either succeeds or quits the game.  

[[Sports team|Sports teams]] also make use of trial and error to qualify for and/or progress through the [[playoffs]] and win the [[championship]], attempting different strategies, plays, lineups and formations in hopes of defeating each and every opponent along the way to victory.  This is especially crucial in [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|playoff series in which multiple wins are required to advance]], where a team that loses a game will have the opportunity to try new tactics to find a way to win, if they are not eliminated yet.

The [[scientific method]] can be regarded as containing an element of trial and error in its formulation and testing of hypotheses. Also compare [[genetic algorithm]]s, [[simulated annealing]] and [[reinforcement learning]] – all varieties for search which apply the basic idea of trial and error.

[[Evolution|Biological evolution]] can be considered as a form of trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Serwall|title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution|journal=Proceedings of the sixth international congress on genetics|date=1932|volume=Number 6|series=Volume 1|page=365|url=http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Random mutations and sexual genetic variations can be viewed as trials and poor reproductive fitness, or lack of improved fitness, as the error. Thus after a long time 'knowledge' of well-adapted genomes accumulates simply by virtue of them being ''able'' to reproduce.

[[Bogosort]], a conceptual sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), can be viewed as a trial and error approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of trial and error. Trial and error is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10207">'''Virgin boy eggs''' are a traditional dish of [[Dongyang, Zhejiang]], [[China]] in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten. Named "tong zi dan" ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 童子蛋; [[pinyin]]: ''Tóngzǐdàn''), the dish translates literally to "boy egg" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's "local [[intangible cultural heritage]]".&lt;ref name="tofu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministryoftofu.com/2011/03/boy-urine-soaked-eggs-listed-as-local-specialty-intangible-cultural-heritage/ |title=Boys’ urine-soaked eggs listed as local specialty, intangible cultural heritage &amp;#124; Ministry of Tofu 豆腐部 |publisher=Ministryoftofu.com |date=March 11, 2011 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dish is a long-standing tradition of Dongyang and its practices date back centuries. In general, China has had a long history of food preservation methods. [[Tea eggs]] were originally developed to preserve the food for long periods of time. While the boy eggs may not have necessarily had the same origin, their development comes from a similar cultural background.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; There is no good explanation for why it must be boys' urine, specifically. It has simply been so for centuries.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/virgin-boy-eggs_n_1387312.html |title=‘Virgin Boy Eggs’ Cooked In Urine Are Spring Delicacy In Dongyang, China |last1=Chan |first1=Royston |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is historically believed in the region that urine has various health benefits and was commonly ingested in ancient times.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/29/10922289-urine-soaked-virgin-boy-eggs-are-a-springtime-taste-treat-in-china |title=Urine-soaked 'virgin boy eggs' are a springtime taste treat in China |last1=Song |first1=Aly |date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=nbcnews |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; In such times, eggs were one of the only nutritional food items available to peasants and farmers. Due to Zhejiang's hilly and riverside landscapes, agriculture has been a staple in the region's culture for centuries. Although rice was the most widely grown crop, most peasants raised their own pigs and poultry on their land as well.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/117333 |title=Zhejiang |last1=Fu Hung |first1=Frederick |last2=Falkenheim |first2=Victor C. |date=March 27, 2013 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the eggs' availability to the common person and, with the supposedly added benefit of urine at the time, the virgin boy eggs grew in popularity. The dish's traditional nature stems from the historical tendency of [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food culture]] to place more care on the detailed history of a specific food. Virgin boy eggs are one example of how Chinese food culture attaches more importance to the anecdotes relating to food, such as its time of invention or the significant historical figures related to the food's invention.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1346774351|title=Functionalism Theory Applied in C-E Translation of Chinese Food Culture Text |last1=Yue |first1=Siwei |publisher=ACADEMY PUBLISHER |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs historically from the western food culture which places more importance on a dish's ingredients and the skills necessary for its preparation. Although the exact history is somewhat obscure to most official sources, the long-standing trend of Chinese food explains the people of Dongyang's loyalty to a traditional dish to which many others find an aversion.

==Preparation==
The dish is prepared by first soaking the eggs in the urine of young boys. The urine is sourced locally by each vendor. Then, the mixture is heated over a stove. After boiling, the egg shells are cracked around the entire surface of the egg. Afterwards, the eggs are placed back into the urine. The used urine is then replaced with fresh urine and the process is repeated. The soaking process allows the eggs to  become [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in the urine as they are left to simmer. The entire process is generally a day-long endeavor.&lt;ref name="tofu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; According to some recipes, different herbs may also be added to the marinade. When finished, the eggs whites have a pale golden hue and the yolks turn green.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/world/what-in-the-world/china-dongyang-eggs-urine.html?partner=bloomberg |title=Recipe for a Chinese Ritual Dish: Eggs, Time and Plenty of Urine |last1=Levin |first1=Dan |date=July 22, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin boy eggs are similar to [[century eggs]] in their curing process and historical roots, although century eggs have become much more popularly widespread and do not use urine.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Modern culture==
Virgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, "The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it. It stinks.”&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; In general, virgin boy eggs remain highly acclaimed by the people of Dongyang for both its taste and even its "fragrant" smell.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

==Health effects and folk medicine==
[[Urophagia]] has been a significant part of Chinese medicine for much of its history. In ancient times, urine was used as a means of enhancing the effects of medicine, although today, the practice is widely viewed as unsanitary by many. It is widely speculated, however, that when urine dries it crystallizes resulting in a substance similar to the Chinese medicine, [[ren zhong bai]]. The crystallized urine sediment is said to aid in the mitigation of inflammation and inflammatory diseases as well as [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] of the skin and mouth.&lt;ref name="thrush"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le-ping |first=Wang |date=1994 |title="The Treatment of 75 Cases of Pediatric Oral Thrush with the Sweet, Cold, Protecting Yin Method" |journal=Shang Hai Zhong Yi Yao Za Zhi (The Shanghai Journal of Chinese Medicine &amp; Medicinals) |issue=5 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that the ingestion of the urine-soaked eggs can treat [[yin deficiency]], decrease one's internal body heat, and promote blood circulation.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; Locals claim, based on anecdotal evidence, that the eggs also prevent [[heat stroke]].&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; Although not the only one, it was widely believed in ancient China that eggs cured in one's own urine for seven days and consumed for a course of three months was a cure for chronic [[asthma]]. Among other uses for urine in Chinese medicine, a young boy's first urine of the day is very powerful and may be combined with herbs to make a [[Herbal tonic|tonic]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutsch |first1=Jonathan |last2=Murakhver |first2=Natalya |date=January 1, 2012 |title=They Eat That?

Skepticism comes from the fact that urination is a bodily mechanism for excreting waste. Evidence-based modern medicine has determined that urine "is waste expelled from the human body and basically contains no substance conducive to human health." Eating the eggs is therefore discouraged by many medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;

'''Yagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; c. 1795&amp;nbsp;– 11 July 1833) was an [[Indigenous Australian]] warrior from the [[Noongar]] people. He played a key part in [[Indigenous Australian resistance|early resistance]] to [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British colonial settlement]] and rule in the area surrounding what is now [[Perth, Western Australia]]. Yagan was pursued by the local authorities after he killed Erin Entwhistle, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler. It was an act of retaliation after Thomas Smedley, another of Butler's servants, shot at a group of Noongar people stealing potatoes and fowls, killing one of them.&lt;ref&gt;N. Green, ''Broken Spears: Aborigines and Europeans in the southwest of Australia'', Perth p. 79. Also Hallam and Tilbrook, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Depositions: Taken Before the Lieutenant Governor and Executive Council at Perth|date = 25 May 1833|work = The Perth Gazette|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government offered a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for Yagan's capture, dead or alive, and a young settler, William Keats, subsequently shot and killed him. Yagan's execution figures in Australian history as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers. He is considered a hero by the Noongar.&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noongar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noongarculture.org.au/yagan/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419144410/http://www.noongarculture.org.au/yagan/|archivedate=19 April 2013|title=Yagan |publisher=[[Land council|South West Aboriginal Land &amp; Sea Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his shooting, settlers removed Yagan's head to claim the bounty. Later, an official sent it to London, where it was exhibited as an "[[anthropology|anthropological]] curiosity" and eventually given to a museum in [[Liverpool]]. It held the head in storage for more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in Liverpool in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2010/07/12/aboriginal-warrior-yagan-is-finally-laid-to-rest-after-170-years-100252-26834867/ Aboriginal warrior Yagan is finally laid to rest after 170 years], ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', 12 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Noongar asked for repatriation of the head, both for religious reasons and because of Yagan's traditional stature. The burial site was identified in 1993; officials [[exhumation of Yagan's head|exhumed the head]] four years later and [[Repatriation|repatriated]] it to Australia. After years of debate within the Noongar community on the appropriate final resting place, Yagan's head was buried in a traditional ceremony in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] in July 2010, 177 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm/|title=Warrior reburied 170 years after death|publisher=[[Australian Geographic]]|date=12 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623230023/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/warrior-reburied-170-years-after-death.htm|archivedate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
A member of the [[Whadjuk]] Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a [[tribe]] of around 60 people whose name, according to [[Robert Lyon (Australian settler)|Robert Lyon]], was ''[[Beeliar (tribe)|Beeliar]]''. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup (or [[clan]]) of a larger tribe whom [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] called ''Beelgar''.&lt;ref name="Bourke 1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourke, Michael|year=1987|chapter=Chapter 3: Yagan 'The Patriot' and 'Governor' Weeip|title=On the Swan|location=Nedlands, Western Australia|publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan]] and [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning]] rivers, as far south as [[Mangles Bay, Western Australia|Mangles Bay]].{{sfn|Green|1984|p=50}} The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as [[Lake Monger, Western Australia|Lake Monger]] and northeast to the [[Helena River]]. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.&lt;ref name="Hallam 1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hallam, Sylvia J.  |author2=Tilbrook, Lois |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990|title = Aborigines of the Southwest Region, 1829–1840 (The Bicentennial Dictionary of Western Australians, Volume VIII)|location= Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122053747/http://nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/|archivedate=22 November 2011 |title=National Museum of Australia – Yagan's story |publisher=Nma.gov.au |date=2 September 1997 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Midgegooroo]], an [[elder (administrative title)|elder]] of the Beeliar people;{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=229}} his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was probably a ''Ballaroke'' in the [[Noongar classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/after-160-years-its-time-for-yagan-to-go-home-1260837.html |title=After 160 years, it's time for Yagan to go home – News |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=11 May 1997 |archivedate=24 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224050019/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/after-160-years-its-time-for-yagan-to-go-home-1260837.html  | first1=Graham | last1=Nown | first2=Andrew | last2=Rosthorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
According to the historian Neville Green, Yagan had a wife and two children.&lt;ref name="Green 1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Neville|year=1981|chapter=Aborigines and White Settlers in the Nineteenth Century|pages=72–123|editor=Stannage, Tom|title=A New History of Western Australia|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} A report in the ''[[Perth Gazette]]'' in 1833 gives the names of his children as "Naral", age 9, and "Willim", age 11;&lt;ref name="Gazette1June1833-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=[[:File:PerthGazette 1833 06 01 2.jpg|The Native's again!!]]  |work=[[Perth Gazette]] |location=Perth |id= |page=87 |date=1 June 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most other sources state that the warrior was unmarried and childless. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder, which identified him as "a man of high degree in tribal law."&lt;ref name="Green 1981"/&gt;{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe.{{sfn|Green|1979|p=2}}

===Relations with settlers===
Yagan would have been about 35 years old in 1829 when [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] settlers landed in the area and established the [[Swan River Colony]].{{sfn|Green|1984|p=39}} For the first two years of the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as ''Djanga'',{{sfn|Green|1984|p=53}} the returned spirits of their dead.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=53}} Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}} As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}} The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=73}}

As the colonists fenced off more land, the Noongar were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=35}} In addition, the Noongar practice of [[firestick farming]]: [[bushfire|firing]] [[the bush]] to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.{{sfn|Green|1984|pp=74–75}}

In December 1831 Yagan and his father led the first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=79}} A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began to break through the mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees to be part of the settlers' groups.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=77}} Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law.&lt;ref name="Hallam 1990"/&gt; Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}}

In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]]. One of the men, John Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimberly|first=W.B.|title=History of West Australia|year=1897|pages=78–79|archivedate=16 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316195308/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia/Chapter_9|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_West_Australia/Chapter_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the [[Round House (Western Australia)|Round House]] at [[Fremantle]]. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler [[Robert Lyon (Australian settler)|Robert Lyon]]. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan should not be considered a criminal but a [[prisoner of war]] and suggested he should be treated as such.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}} At the recommendation of [[John Septimus Roe]], the [[Surveyor-General of Western Australia]], Yagan and his men were exiled on [[Carnac Island]] under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=80}}{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=36}}

Lyon thought he could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his cooperation and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=81}} After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended [[dinghy]] and rowing to [[Woodman Point, Western Australia|Woodman Point]] on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=81}}{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|pp=38–39}}

In January 1833 two Noongar, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from [[King George Sound]],{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=229}} where relations between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard [Robert?] Dale and George Smythe, arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=40}}{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} The men exchanged weapons and held a ''[[corroboree]]'', though the groups did not appear to share a language. Yagan and Gyallipert competed at spear throwing.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} As an example of his prowess, Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of 25&amp;nbsp;metres.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=40}}

Gyallipert and Manyat remained in Perth for some time. On 3 March, Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree, this time in the Post Office garden in Perth. The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk, chalked their bodies, and performed a number of dances including a [[kangaroo]] hunt dance. ''[[The Perth Gazette]]'' wrote that Yagan "was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article642172 |title=Native Corrobory at Perth |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=16 March 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=42 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}}

During February and March, Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken [[handkerchief]]s. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear.&lt;ref name="perthgazMar21833"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article642195 |title=The Soldier Speared at Clarence |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=2 March 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=34 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted ''The Perth Gazette'' to remark on "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee&amp;nbsp;... For the most trivial offence&amp;nbsp; ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief."&lt;ref name="perthgazMar21833"/&gt;

===Wanted dead or alive===
On the night of 29 April, a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} and they were shot at by the caretaker Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to [[Preston Point, Western Australia|Preston Point]], where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at [[Bull Creek, Western Australia|Bull Creek]], where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}} Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen.{{sfn|Green|1979|p=3}}{{sfn|Green|1984|p=84}} [[Alexandra Hasluck]] has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack,{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=41}} but this has been refuted elsewhere.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=82}}

For the killing of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor [[Frederick Irwin]] declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture, dead or alive.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} Munday successfully appealed against his proscription.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=84}} Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley.{{sfn|Green|1984|pp=84–85}} On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]. Yagan remained at large for over two months.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}}{{sfn|Green|1984|p=86}}

Late in May, [[George Fletcher Moore]] reported seeing Yagan on his property and talking with him in [[pidgin]] English. Moore wrote in the ''Perth Gazette'':
{{quote|Yagan stepped forward and leaning with his left hand on my shoulder while he gesticulated with the right, delivered a sort of recitation, looking earnestly in my face. I regret I could not understand it, I thought from the tone and manner that the purport was this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You came to our country&amp;nbsp;— you have driven us from our haunts, and disturbed us in our occupations. As we walk in our own country we are fired upon by the white men; why should the white men treat us so?"&lt;ref name="Gazette1June1833-2"&gt;{{cite news |title=From a correspondent |first=George Fletcher |last=Moore |authorlink=George Fletcher Moore |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:PerthGazette_1833_06_01_2.jpg |work=[[Perth Gazette]] |location=[[Perth, Western Australia]] |id= |page=87 |date=1 June 1833 |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Since Moore had little knowledge of Yagan's native language, the historian Hasluck suggests that this account is probably more indicative of "a feeling of conscience on the part of the white men" than an accurate rendering of Yagan's state of mind.{{sfn|Hasluck|1961|p=44}}}}

Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three."&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moore, George Fletcher|year=1884|title=[[Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia|Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia, and also a Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines]]| pages=191–192 |location=London | publisher=M.

He later wrote, "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor&amp;nbsp;... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire."&lt;ref name="Moore 1884"/&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:Yagan-Belhus.png|thumb|Map of skirmish area showing gravesite and Henry Bull's mill]]
On 11 July 1833, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of [[Guildford, Western Australia|Guildford]] when a group of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from [[Henry Bull (settler)|Henry Bull]]'s house.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} While he was staying with them during the morning, the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=230}} When the natives were ready to depart, the Keateses took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act of throwing his spear. The brothers ran away, but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death. James escaped by swimming the river. Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.{{sfn|Green|1984|p=87}}{{sfn|Green|1979|p=4}}

When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} Heegan "was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces."{{sfn|Green|1984|p=87}} The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}}

James Keates claimed the reward, but his conduct was widely criticised.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} ''The Perth Gazette'' referred to Yagan's killing as "a wild and treacherous act&amp;nbsp;... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed."&lt;ref name="Perth Gazette 18330713"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article641981 |title=THE NATIVES. |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |date=20 July 1833 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |page=114 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] understood that "he was killed in self-defence by the young lad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38887581 |title=Aboriginal Perth |author=Daisy M.

==Yagan's head==

===Exhibition and burial===
[[Image:Yagan's head from Moore's diary.png|thumb|A portion of [[George Fletcher Moore]]'s handwritten diary, showing sketches of Yagan's head{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=232}}]]
Yagan's head was initially taken to Henry Bull's house. Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished, handwritten diary, commenting that "possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home."{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=231}} The head was preserved by smoking.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=232}}

In September 1833, [[Frederick Irwin|Governor Irwin]] sailed for London, partly to give his own account of the events leading up to the killing. This was an unusual measure, especially given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin's administration of the colony.&lt;ref name="Cook 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cook | first = Karen Severud | year = 2003 | title = The Secret Agenda of Western Australian Explorer, Robert Dale (1809–1853) | journal=The Globe | issue = 54 | pages = 23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelling with Irwin was Ensign [[Robert Dale]], who had somehow acquired Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an "anthropological curiosity".&lt;ref name="Turnbull 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Turnbull | first = Paul | year = 1998 | title = "Outlawed Subjects": The Procurement and Scientific Uses of Australian Aboriginal Heads, ca. 1803–1835 | journal=Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 22|issue = 1|pages = 156–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of [[anatomy|anatomists]] and [[phrenology|phrenologists]]. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with [[Thomas Pettigrew]] for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and [[autopsy|autopsied]] [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=An interview with Egyptologist Salima Ikram |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mummy/ikram.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; The Mummy Who Would Be King &amp;#124; The Afterlife |publisher=PBS |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He displayed the head on a table in front of a [[Panoramic View of King George's Sound, Part of the Colony of Swan River|panoramic view of King George Sound]] reproduced from Dale's sketches.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the [[red-tailed black cockatoo]].

[[Image:Yagan.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Yagan'' by [[George Cruikshank]].&lt;br /&gt;This portrait was painted from observations of Yagan's severed head, which had shrunk substantially during preservation by smoking. [[George Fletcher Moore]] said it bore little resemblance to the living Yagan, whose face was "plump, with a burly-headed look about it".&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1884, [https://archive.org/stream/diarytenyearsev00moorgoog#page/n310/mode/2up p. 289]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pettigrew had the head examined by a phrenologist. Examination was considered difficult because of the large [[Bone fracture|fracture]] across the back of the head caused by the gunshot. His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name="Turnbull 1998"/&gt; Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled ''[[Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country]]'',&lt;ref name="Dale 1834"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale, Robert|year=1834|title=Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &amp;amp;c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country|location=London|publisher=J. Cross &amp; R. Havell|authorlink=Robert Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a [[souvenir]] of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured [[aquatint]] print of Yagan's head by the artist [[George Cruikshank]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}}

Early in October 1835, Yagan's head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale, then living in [[Liverpool]]. On 12 October he presented them to the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]],{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the [[Liverpool Museum]]; it is thought not to have been put on display there.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=233}} By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a [[Peru]]vian mummy and a [[Māori people|Māori]] head. They were buried in [[Everton Cemetery]]'s General Section 16, grave number 296.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=233–234}} In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 [[stillbirth|stillborn]] babies and two infants who died soon after birth.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}}

===Lobbying for repatriation===
For many years beginning in the early 1980s,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan's head to Australia.
{{quote|It is Aboriginal belief that because Yagan's skeletal remains are incomplete, his spirit is earthbound. The uniting of his head and torso will immediately set his spirit free to continue its eternal journey.&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt;}}

At the time, there was no historical trail for the head after Pettigrew passed it on. Tribal elders entrusted the Aboriginal leader [[Ken Colbung]] with the search.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} In the early 1990s, Colbung enlisted the aid of [[University of London]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Peter Ucko]]. One of Ucko's researchers, Cressida Fforde, &lt;!--was funded by the [[Government of Australia]] to--&gt; conducted a literature search for information on the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/now_showing/first_australians/resistance/yagan/repatriation/ |title=National Museum of Australia – Repatriation |publisher=Nma.gov.au |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitech-fbi-tools-to-retrieve-aborigine-chiefs-head-1253531.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107123910/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitech-fbi-tools-to-retrieve-aborigine-chiefs-head-1253531.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|title=Hi-tech FBI tools to retrieve aborigine chief's head – News |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=1 June 1997 |accessdate=10 July 2010  | first=Ian | last=Burrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fforde successfully traced the head in December 1993.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=42, 235}} The following April, Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the [[Burial Act 1857]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}} [[Home Office]] regulations required [[next of kin]] consent before disturbing the remains of the 22 infants. Colbung's solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan's living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=235}}

Meanwhile, divisions in the Noongar community in Perth began to develop. Some elders questioned Colbung's role and one Noongar registered a complaint with the [[Liverpool City Council]] over his involvement. Media reports indicated acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|pp=235–236}} The academic Hannah McGlade claims that these divisions were largely manufactured by the media, particularly ''[[The West Australian]]'', which "aimed to and successfully represented the Nyungar community in terms of disharmony and dissent". She alleges that one ''West'' reporter contacted Noongar who were known to be in disagreement, and quoted one to the other, so as to elicit provocative responses. The disputes were "trumpeted" by ''The West'', allowing it to "preach" against the infighting.&lt;ref name="McGlade 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 1998 | title = The repatriation of Yagan: A story of manufacturing dissent | journal=Law Text Culture | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 245–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July a public meeting was held in Perth. All parties agreed to put aside their differences and co-operate to ensure that the repatriation was a "national success".{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung's application was allowed to proceed.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}}  In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation. It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, and received unconditional consent from only one. Accordingly, on 30 June 1995, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}}

Meeting on 21 September, the Yagan Steering Committee decided to lobby Australian and British politicians for support. In 1997 Colbung was invited to visit the United Kingdom at the British government's expense{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} and he arrived on 20 May. His visit attracted substantial media coverage,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=236}} and increased the political pressure on the British Government. He secured the support of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], after [[gatecrasher (person)|gate crashing]] the Prime Minister's June visit to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}}

===Exhumation===
{{Main article|Exhumation of Yagan's head}}
[[Image:Yagan's grave surface EM data.png|thumb|300px|A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site, showing an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature caused by metal artefacts buried with Yagan's head]]
While Colbung was in the United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a [[geophysics|geophysical]] survey of the grave site. Using [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[ground penetrating radar]] techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.&lt;ref name="Bates 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Geophysics: Yagan's Head|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sgg/personal/crblink/web/arch/yagan.htm|accessdate=14 December 2005|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050312073041/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sgg/personal/crblink/web/arch/yagan.htm |archivedate = 12 March 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}} In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=237}}

Colbung continued to press for the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} His request was not met, and on the anniversary of Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}}

The [[exhumation of Yagan's head]] eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} by excavating six feet down the side of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a [[forensics|forensic]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] from the [[University of Bradford]] positively identified the [[human skull|skull]] as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report.&lt;ref name="Bates 2005"/&gt;{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}}

===Repatriation===
On 27 August 1997, a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, [[Robert Bropho]], Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation was to have been larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=238}} On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.&lt;ref name="McGlade 1998"/&gt;

Yagan's skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at [[Liverpool Town Hall]] on 31 August 1997.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], earlier that day:{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} &lt;blockquote&gt;That is how nature goes&amp;nbsp;... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Maeder, Jay: [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/newsreel-article-1.783688 The Newsreel: The Long And Winding Road], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 4 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}}

Throughout the repatriation process, many sections of the international media treated the story as a joke. For example, the ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' ran a story under the headline ''Raiders of the Lost Conk'', in which Yagan's head was referred to as a "pickled curio", and Colbung's actions were treated as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="Shoemaker 2000"/&gt;

===Preparations for reburial===
On its return to Perth, Yagan's head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a "Committee for the Reburial of Yagan's Kaat", headed by Richard Wilkes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, Richard [http://www.dia.wa.gov.au/Documents/News/Yagan%20Memorial%20Park/YMP_Newsletter_Feb24.pdf A Message from the Chairperson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216230719/http://dia.wa.gov.au/Documents/News/Yagan%20Memorial%20Park/YMP_Newsletter_Feb24.pdf |date=16 February 2011 }} Yagan Memorial Park Newsletter, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location, mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body.

A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of [[Belhus, Western Australia|Belhus]].&lt;ref name="DIA 2009"&gt;{{cite news | title = Yagan Memorial Park | date = November 2009 | newspaper = DIA Newsletter | issue = 1 | publisher = Department of Indigenous Affairs, Government of Western Australia | page = 4 | url = http://purl.slwa.wa.gov.au/download/slwa_b2920804_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[remote sensing]] survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that [[Dreamtime]] spirits can reunite the remains.&lt;ref name="Lampathakis 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lampathakis|first=Paul|title=Hunt for Yagan narrows|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=6 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs]] jointly published a document entitled ''Yagan's Gravesite Master Plan'', which discussed "matters of ownership, management, development and future use" of the property on which Yagan's remains are believed to be buried. Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an Indigenous burial site, to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board.

Yagan's head spent some time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state [[morgue|mortuary]]. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups.&lt;ref name="Philip 2006"&gt;Philip, Martin (2006). "Yagan waits for final resting place." ''The West Australian'', 26 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan's head would be reburied in November, and a [[Yagan Memorial Park]] created as a projected cost of A$996,000;&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Lindsay (2008). "Head of Nyoongar warrior Yagan will be finally laid to rest in Swan Valley]". ''The West Australian'', 4 September 2008, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPhee|first=Lindsay|date=19 November 2008|title=Reburial of Yagan head is delayed|newspaper=The West Australian|page=15|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, it was announced that the [[Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs|Department of Indigenous Affairs]] had given the [[City of Swan]] more than A$500,000 to develop the park.&lt;ref name="ABC March 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title = Memorial park for Noongar warrior | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/05/2508739.htm | work=ABC News | accessdate =6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reburial===

==Legacy==
The repatriation of Yagan's head increased the Aboriginal leader's notability. He is considered a famous historical figure throughout Australia,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}} with material about him appearing in such publications as the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'',&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last = Hasluck | first = Alexandra | authorlink = Alexandra Hasluck |year= 1967|title =Yagan ( – 1833)| id = A020578b.htm | accessdate =6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Western Australia's school [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="CCoWA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Aboriginal and intercultural studies | url = http://newwace.curriculum.wa.edu.au/docs/COS_docs/171791_7_1.pdf |format=PDF| publisher=[[Curriculum Council of Western Australia]] | accessdate =6 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080411053559/http://newwace.curriculum.wa.edu.au/docs/COS_docs/171791_7_1.pdf |archivedate = 11 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of greatest significance, however, to the Noongar people,{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=234}} for whom he is "a revered, cherished and heroic individual&amp;nbsp;... patriot and visionary hero of WA's South-West".&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colbung, Ken|year=1996|title=Yagan: The Swan River "Settlement"|publisher=Australia Council for the Arts|authorlink=Ken Colbung}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return of his head was likened by some Indigenous Australians to the November 1993 ceremonial repatriation from [[Gallipoli]] of Australia's [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unknown soldier]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 2001"&gt;[[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] (2001).

[[Image:Alas Poor Yagan (2 panels).jpg|thumb|400px|The final two frames of [[Dean Alston]]'s 1997 cartoon ''[[Alas Poor Yagan]]'']]
On 6 September 1997 ''[[The West Australian]]'' published a [[Dean Alston]] [[cartoon]] entitled ''[[Alas Poor Yagan]]'',&lt;ref name="Alston 1997"&gt;[[Dean Alston|Alston, Dean]] (1997). [[Alas Poor Yagan]]. ''[[The West Australian]]'', 6 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity.&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage.&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"/&gt; The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]] because it was "an artistic work" that was published "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt.&lt;ref name="Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 2001"/&gt; This ruling was upheld on appeal by the [[Federal Court of Australia]],&lt;ref name="Federal Court of Australia 2004"&gt;[[Federal Court of Australia]] (2004).

===Statue===
From the mid-1970s, members of the Noongar community lobbied for the erection of a [[statue]] of Yagan as part of the [[WAY 1979]] sesquicentennial celebrations. Their requests were refused, however, after then [[Premier of Western Australia]] [[Charles Court|Sir Charles Court]] was advised by one prominent historian that Yagan was not important enough to warrant a statue.&lt;ref name="Inglis 1998"&gt;{{cite book | first = K. S. | last = Inglis | year = 1998 | title = Sacred Places | publisher=Melbourne University Press | isbn = 0-522-84976-8 | page = 448 | quote = [Hasluck] advised the states anti-Labor government not to agree. University historians pleaded Yagan's cause in vain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbung claims "Court was more interested in spending tax payers' money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|Captain James Stirling]], WA's first governor."&lt;ref name="Colbung 1996"/&gt; Despite this setback, the Noongar community persisted, establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund-raising drives. Eventually, sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor [[Robert Hitchcock]] to create a statue. The result was a life-size statue in [[bronze]], depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders. Hitchcock's statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on 11 September 1984. It stands on [[Heirisson Island]] in the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] near Perth.

In 1997, within a week of the return of Yagan's head to Perth, vandals beheaded the statue using an [[angle grinder]]. Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen. Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a "British loyalist" as an act of retaliation for Colbung's comments about [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].{{sfn|Fforde|2002|p=239}} The [[Western Australia Police]] did not succeed in identifying the vandals, nor in recovering the heads, and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard.&lt;ref name="Phillips 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Western Australia: July to December 1977 | journal=[[Australian Journal of Politics &amp; History]] | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 270–285 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00018 | author=[[Harry C. J. Phillips|Phillips, Harry]] |author2=Black, David |authorlink2=David Black (historian) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One column in ''The West Australia'' found humour in them, referring to the head as a "bonce" and a "noggin", and finished with a pun on "skullduggery".&lt;ref name="Muecke 2004"/&gt; Stephen Muecke calls this the "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns";&lt;ref name="Muecke 2004"&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Muecke | year = 2004 |pages=39–42 |title = Ancient and Modern: Time, Culture and Indigenous Philosophy | publisher=UNSW Press | isbn = 0-86840-786-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Adam Shoemaker writes "This is the stuff of light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence&amp;nbsp;... [T]he piece has a definite authorising function".&lt;ref name="Shoemaker 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Adam | last = Shoemaker | year = 2000 | title = The Headless State | journal=Griffith Law Review | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 358–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own."&lt;ref name="Martin 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | first = David | last = Martin | year = 2007 | title = Of monuments and masks: historiography in the time of curiosity's ruin | journal=Postcolonial studies | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–320 | doi = 10.1080/13688790701488197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]] [[Janet Woollard]] called for the statue's [[intimate part|genitalia]] to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again called for the statue's groin to be covered, on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.&lt;ref name="Kent 2005"&gt;Kent, Melissa (2005).
