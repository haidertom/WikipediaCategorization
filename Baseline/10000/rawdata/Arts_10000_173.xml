'''''99% Invisible''''' is an independently produced radio show created by [[Roman Mars]] that focuses on design and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; 99% Invisible |publisher=99percentinvisible.org |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212211134/http://99percentinvisible.org/about/ |archivedate=2014-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a collaborative project between San Francisco [[public radio]] station [[KALW]] and the [[American Institute of Architects]] in San Francisco. Versions of the show are distributed by [[Public Radio Exchange|PRX]] for broadcast by a number of radio stations, and as a [[podcast]] as part of the [[Radiotopia]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.prx.org/PRXRadiotopia_release_FINAL.pdf |title=PRX launches Radiotopia, new podcast network of story-driven public radio shows |publisher=Media.prx.org |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221174630/http://media.prx.org/PRXRadiotopia_release_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The show's name is taken from a quote by [[Buckminster Fuller]]: "Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designenvy.aiga.org/99-invisible-roman-mars/ |title=Design Envy · 99% Invisible: Roman Mars |publisher=Designenvy.aiga.org |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221222141/http://designenvy.aiga.org/99-invisible-roman-mars/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to expose the unseen and overlooked aspects of design, architecture, and activity in the world. Each episode generally focuses on a single topic or specific example of design, often including interviews with architects, experts, or people who have been influenced by the design.

In 2014, ''99% Invisible'' began its fourth season, the first in which it had a weekly release schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/news/kickstart-season-4-weekly/ |title=Kickstart Season 4- Weekly! &amp;#124; 99% Invisible |publisher=99percentinvisible.org |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011425/http://99percentinvisible.org/news/kickstart-season-4-weekly/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2018 staff include episode producers Avery Trufelman, Katie Mingle, Delany Hall, Emmet FitzGerald, technical producer Sharif Yousseff, administrative assistant Taryn Mazza, musical composer Sean Real, and digital director Kurt Kohlstedt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/about/the-staff/|title=About &amp;#124; 99% Invisible|last=|first=|date=2015-12-05|website=|publisher=99percentinvisible.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074107/https://99percentinvisible.org/about/the-staff/|archivedate=2018-03-10|dead-url=no|accessdate=March 9, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

==Life==

===Early years===
Abd ar-Rahman was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], the grandson of [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]], seventh independent [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] emir of [[al-Andalus]]. His parents were Abdullah's son Muhammad and Muzna (or Muzayna), a Christian concubine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/abd-al-rahman-iii/ Abd al-Rahman, III Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta [[Onneca Fortúnez]], daughter of the captive king [[Fortún Garcés of Pamplona]]. Abd ar-Rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen [[Toda of Pamplona]]. He is described as having "white skin, blue eyes and attractive face; good looking, although somewhat sturdy and stout. His legs were short, to the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it. When mounted, he looked tall, but on his feet he was quite short. He dyed his beard black.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Idhari]], ''Kitab al-Bayan''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father Abdallah. Al-Mutarrif had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], and Muhammad had been imprisoned. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammad's fall, as well as Al-Mutarrif's death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem. Al-Mutarrif's sister, known as ''al-Sayyida'' ("the Lady"), was entrusted with his education. She made sure that Abd ar-Rahman's education was conducted with some rigor.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hazm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accession to throne===
Emir Abdallah died at the age of 72. Despite the fact that four of his sons (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad) were alive at the time of his death, all of them were passed over for succession. Abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III (the son of his first son). This came as no surprise, since Abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions. Most importantly Abdallah gave Abd al-Rahman his ring, the symbol of power, when Abdallah fell ill prior to his death. Abd al-Rahman succeeded Abdallah the day after his death, 16 October 912.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Historiographers of the time, such as ''[[Al-Bayan al-Mughrib]]'' and the ''Crónica anónima de Abd al-Rahman III'', state that his succession was "without incident".  At the time, Abd al-Rahman was about 21 or 22 years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of Córdoba.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; To the north, the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was continuing its program of ''[[Reconquista]]'' in the [[Douro]] valley. To the south in [[Ifriqiya]], the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the Muslim population, who had suffered under the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented [[Muladi]] families (Muslims of Iberian origin) represented a constant danger for the Córdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], controlled much of eastern Al-Andalus.

From the very early stages of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of al-Andalus, consolidate centralized power, and reestablish internal order within the emirate. Within 10 days of taking the throne, he exhibited the head of a rebel leader in Cordoba.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; From this point on he led annual expeditions against the northern and southern tribes to maintain control over them. To accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the ''[[saqaliba]]h'', slaves of East European origin. The ''saqalibah'' represented a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his subjects of Muslim [[Arabs|Arab]] heritage, and those of Muslim [[Berbers|Berber]] heritage.

[[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], a Jewish courtier of the king's court who served as financier to the king, wrote of the king's revenues on this wise:
{{quote|The revenue of the king [Abd ar-Rahman] amounts annually to 100,000 florins, this arising only from the income derived from the numerous merchants who come hither from various countries and isles. All their commerce and affairs must be subjected to my guidance, praised be the Almighty, who bestows his mercy upon me! The kings of the world no sooner perceive of the greatness of my monarch, than they hasten to convey to him presents in abundance. It is myself who am appointed to receive such presents, and at the same time to return rewards awarded to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahberet Menahem'' (ed. Herschell Filipowski), London &amp; Edinburgh 1854 (reprinted: Jerusalem 1987), in: ''Biography of the Author (the Celebrated Rabbi Menahem ben Saruk)'', p. 7; cf. Elkan Nathan Adler, ''Jewish Travellers'', Routledge:London 1931, pp. 22–36 [''vide'' Cambridge University Library, Taylor-Schecter Collection (T-S Misc.35.38)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early rule===
During the first 20 years of his rule, Abd ar-Rahman avoided military action against the northern Christian kingdoms, Asturias and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy.&lt;ref name=wikisource&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abd-ar-Rahman|display=Abd-ar-Rahman s.v Abd-ar-Rahman III|volume=1|pages=31-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians.

[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]].]]
He first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of [[Écija]], at some {{convert|50|km}} from the capital. All the city's fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the ''coras'' (provinces) of [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]] and [[Province of Granada|Granada]], while a cavalry detachment was sent to free [[Málaga]] from ibn Hafsun's siege. He also obtained the capitulation of [[Fiñana]] (in the modern [[province of Almería]]), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently, he moved against the castle of [[Juviles]] in the [[Alpujarras]]. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his [[siege engine]]s could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to Córdoba, in order to secure their continued submission.

In the first year of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the [[Banu Hayyay]] lords of [[Seville]] and [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]] to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps (''hasam'') under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of Écija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. He next went after the forts in the provinces of Elvira, [[Province of Granada|Granada]], and [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaen]], all of which were either directly or indirectly controlled by Hafsun.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of [[vizier]]. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death.

The region of [[Valencia]] submitted peacefully in 915.

===Ibn Hafsun and other rebels===

Abd ar-Rahman's next objective was to quash the longstanding rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun.

His troops left Córdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped before the walls of Balda (identified with today's [[Cuevas de San Marcos]]). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of [[Algarinejo]], which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.

The Umayyad army then moved to the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahman's troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of Olías and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of Málaga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near [[Benahavís]], Suhayl ([[Fuengirola]]) and another castle called ''Turrus ''or ''Turrus Jusayn'' (identified by [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] as [[Ojén]]). He finally arrived at [[Algeciras]] on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun from the [[Maghreb]]. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.

Abd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years.

In 921 the Banu Muhallab of [[Guadix]] submitted, followed by those of [[Jerez de la Frontera]] and [[Cádiz]], as well as the trading republic of [[Pechina]] (922). In 927, Abd ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel [[Banu Qasi]], but was forced to break it off by the intervention of [[Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona]].

The last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who commanded his powerful fortress of Umar ibn Hafsun. Surrounded by Abd ar-Rahman's vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; until he surrendered in 928 and had his life spared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Schreiber|title=Gli Arabi in Spagna|page=142|publisher=Garzanti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Levente and Algarve rebels===
The continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a weak position, such as the governor of [[Évora]], who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of León), [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]], who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners and massacring many Muslims.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahman's authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack from Ordoño, but also acted in complete independence from Córdoba. To avoid the fall of Évora into the hands of the Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving its control to his ally Masud ibn Sa' dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a muladí coalition led by Sa'id ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], and the lords of [[Faro, Portugal|Ocsónoba]], Yahya ibn Bakr, and of [[Taifa of Niebla|Niebla]], Ibn Ufayr. [[Alcácer do Sal]] and [[Lisbon]] were under control of the [[Banu Dānis]].

The absence of royal authority enabled Ordoño II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective being the city of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], in the summer of 915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber ''jefes'' offered some resistance which was ineffective.

In the next year, despite having defeated only some of the rebels,  Abd ar-Rahman III considered himself powerful enough to declare himself [[Caliph of Córdoba]] (16 January 929), effectively breaking his allegiance to, and ties with, the [[Fatimid]] and [[Abbasid]] caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/abd-ar-rahman-iii.htm Abd-ar-Rahman III] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217165547/http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/abd-ar-rahman-iii.htm |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The caliphate was thought only to belong to the Emperor who ruled over the sacred cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and his ancestors had until then been content with the title of emir. But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd ar-Rahman's prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.

Abd ar-Rahman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jewish subjects. The symbols of his new caliphate power were a scepter (''jayzuran'') and the throne (''sarir''). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to mint gold dinars&lt;ref&gt;No gold Islamic coins had been found in Spain preceding Abd ar-Rahman III's reign. See Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and silver dirhams, replacing the "al-Andalus" title with his name.

In his new role of caliph, he achieved the surrender of [[Ibn Marwan]] of Badajoz in 930 as well as the surrender of the Banu Dānis of Alcácer do Sal. On the southern front, to counter the increasing Fatimid power in North Africa, abd ar-Rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in [[Almeria]]. The caliph helped the [[Maghrawa]] Berbers conquer [[Melilla]] (927), [[Ceuta]] (931)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and [[Tangiers]] (951), which accepted his suzerainty. However, he was unable to defeat [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] of the [[Fatamid]]s.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of León, [[Ordoño III of León|Ordoño III]], in order to have a free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were harassing the caliphate ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman's force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through paying a huge sum.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end he was able to create a protectorate covering the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the [[Idrisid]] dynasty; the caliphate influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.

===War with the Christian kingdoms of the north===
Even before al-Andalus was firmly under his rule, he had restarted the war against King [[Ordoño II of León]], who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against León, but this force was destroyed at the [[Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz (917)|Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz]] in September of that year.

Recognizing he had underestimated the power of Ordoño II, in 920 Abd ar-Rahman mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. He captured the forts of [[Osma]] and [[San Esteban de Gormaz]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; After defeating King [[Sancho Garcés I of Navarre]] and the king of [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] at [[Battle of Valdejunquera|Valdejunquera]] on 26 July,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; he penetrated into Navarre, overcoming Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of [[Pamplona]], which was sacked and its cathedral church demolished.

In 924 Abd ar-Rahman felt obliged to avenge the massacre of Viguera castle perpetrated by King Sancho Ordóñez of Navarre one year earlier. he launched counter offensive against Sancho in which Abd ar-Rahman devastated a large area of Basque territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qVYT4Kraym0C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=Abd-ar-Rahman++III+zaragoza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aNLLVJW5O82qaaaZgbAB&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Abd-ar-Rahman%20%20III%20zaragoza&amp;f=false Al Maqqari, Nafh at-Tih, I, page 363]&lt;/ref&gt;

The succession crisis which struck León after Ordoño II's death in the same year caused hostilities to cease until [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]] obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt by him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king capturing [[Madrid]] and scoring a victory at [[Osma]].

In 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and [[Álava]], Abd ar-Rahmad forced Ramiro to retreat to [[Burgos]], and forced the Navarrese queen [[Toda of Navarre|Toda]], his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son [[García Sánchez I of Pamplona|García Sánchez I]]. In 937 Abd ar-Rahmad conquered some thirty castles in León. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of [[Zaragoza]], who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.

Despite early defeats, Ramiro and García were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the [[Battle of Simancas]], and almost kill Abd ar-Rahman,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; due, most likely, to treason by Arab elements in the caliph's army. After this defeat, Abd ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was helped, however, by [[Fernán González of Castile]], one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiro's successor, [[Ordoño III of León]], in 956. However they did not press this advantage as civil war broke out in the Christian territories.

[[File:Dirham abd al rahman iii 17493.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Abd ar-Rahman III, minted in Medina Azahara in 959/960 AD]] 
In 950 Abd ar-Rahman received in Córdoba an embassy from count [[Borrell II of Barcelona]], by which the northern county recognized caliphate supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support. In 958, [[Sancho I of León|Sancho]], the exiled king of [[Kingdom of León|Leon]], [[García Sánchez I|Garcia Sanchez]], King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Toda of Navarre|Queen Toda]] all paid homage to Abd ar-Rahman in [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Cordoba]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Until 961, the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife characterizing the Christian kingdom during the period. Ordoño III's half-brother and successor, [[Sancho I of León|Sancho the Fat]], had been deposed by his cousin [[Ordoño IV of León|Ordoño IV]]. Together with his grandmother Toda of Navarre, Sancho sought an alliance with Córdoba. In exchange for some castles, Abd ar-Rahman helped them to take back [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] (959) and [[Oviedo]] (960) and to overthrow Ordoño IV.

===Later years===
Abd ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the [[harem]].&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; He is known to have openly kept a male as well as a female harem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia'', ed. Michael Gerli (New York: Routledge, 2003), 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt; This likely influenced the polemical story of his falling in love with a 13-year-old boy (later enshrined as a Christian martyr and canonised as [[Pelagius of Cordova|Saint Pelagius of Córdoba]]) who refused the Caliph's advances. The love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, however, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus contributing to the Christian perception of Muslim brutality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpaklı, ''The Age of Beloveds'', Duke University Press, 2005; p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology'', Chicago, 1997; pp.10–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside Córdoba. He died in October 961 and was succeeded by his son [[al-Hakam II]].

==Legacy==
Abd ar-Rahman was a great [[humanist]] and patron of arts, especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded, and a third was spent on buildings.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the [[Medina Azahara]], built some five kilometers north of Córdoba.  The Medina Azahara was modeled after the old Umayyad palace in [[Damascus]] and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors. It was said that Cordoba contained 3000 mosques and 100,000 shops and homes during his reign.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Under his reign, Córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the city's library, which would be further enriched by his successors.

{{quote|text=I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to Fourteen: - O man! place not thy confidence in this present world!}}

He also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in [[Mediterranean Europe]]. Iberian raiders moved up to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Asturias, and North Africa. The colonizers of [[Fraxinetum]] came from al-Andalus as well.

Due to his consolidation of power, Muslim Iberia became a power for a few centuries. It also brought prosperity, and with this he created mints where pure gold and silver coins were created. He renovated and added to the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

He was very wary of losing control and kept tight reins in his family. In 949, he executed one of his sons for conspiring against him. He was tolerant of non-Muslims, Jews and Christians who were treated fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reviewing Imperial Conflicts|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Baptista|first2=Cristina|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=|location=|pages=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; European nations sent emissaries such as from [[Otto I]] of Germany, and the [[Byzantine]] emperor.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

{{Other uses|Acquired Taste (disambiguation)}}

An '''acquired taste''' is an appreciation for something unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it. In the case of food and drink, this may be due to a strong [[odor]] (such as certain types of [[cheese]], [[durian]], [[hákarl]], [[Kala Namak|black salt]], [[nattō]], [[asafoetida]], [[surströmming]], or [[stinky tofu]]), [[taste]] ([[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[Vegemite]] or [[Marmite]], bitter [[tea]]s, [[salty liquorice]], [[malt bread]], [[Types of chocolate#Classification|unsweetened chocolate]], [[sushi]], [[garnatálg]]), mouthfeel (such as [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] featuring uncooked seafood), appearance, or association (such as [[Entomophagy|eating insects]] or organ meat).

== Acquiring the taste ==
===General acquisition of tastes===
The process of acquiring a taste can involve developmental maturation, genetics (of both taste sensitivity and personality), family example, and biochemical reward properties of foods.  Infants are born preferring sweet foods and rejecting sour and bitter tastes, and they develop a preference for salt at approximately 4 months.  [[Neophobia]] (fear of novelty) tends to vary with age in predictable, but not linear, ways.  Babies just beginning to eat solid foods generally accept a wide variety of foods, toddlers and young children are relatively neophobic towards food, and older children, adults, and the elderly are often adventurous eaters with wide-ranging tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=L. L.|title=Development of food preferences|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=41–62|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general personality trait of novelty-seeking does not necessarily correlate highly with willingness to try new foods.  Level of food adventurousness may explain much of the variability of food preferences observed in "[[supertasters]]".  Supertasters are highly sensitive to bitter, spicy, and pungent flavours, and some avoid them and like to eat only mild, plain foods, but many supertasters who have high food adventurousness enjoy these intense flavors and seek them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullrich|first1=N. V.|last2=Touger-Decker|first2=R.|last3=O’Sullivan-Maillet|first3=J.|last4=Tepper|first4=B. J.|title=PROP taster status and self-perceived food adventurousness influence food preferences|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=2004|volume=104|issue=4|pages=543–549|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some chemicals or combinations of chemicals in foods provide both flavor and beneficial or enjoyable effects on the body and mind and may be reinforcing, leading to an acquired taste.  A study that investigated the effect of adding caffeine and theobromine (active compounds in chocolate) vs. a placebo to identically-flavored drinks that participants tasted several times, yielded the development of a strong preference for the drink with the compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smit|first1=H. J.|last2=Blackburn|first2=R. J.|title=Reinforcing effects of caffeine and theobromine as found in chocolate|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2005|volume=181|issue=1|pages=101–106|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-2209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional acquisition of tastes===
Intentionally changing one's preferences can be hard to accomplish. It usually requires a deliberate effort, acting as if one likes something in order to have the responses and feelings that will produce the desired taste. The challenge becomes one of distinguishing authentic or legitimate acquired tastes as a result of deeply considered preference changes from inauthentic ones motivated by status or [[conformity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=Sour Grapes and Character Planning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1992|volume=89|issue=2|pages=57–78|doi=10.2307/2027152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=The Intentional Acquisition of Mental States|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1995|volume=55|issue=4|pages=821–840|doi=10.2307/2108334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Athens School of Fine Arts''' ('''ASFA'''; {{lang-el|Ανωτάτη Σχολή Καλών Τεχνών, ΑΣΚΤ}}, literally: Highest School of Fine Arts), is [[Greece]]'s premier [[Art school]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} whose main objective is to develop the artistic talents of its students.

==History==
The Athens School of Fine Arts was established on 12 January 1837, known as the ''School for the Arts''. In the beginning the School of Arts included three departments: the Crafts' School (part-time school), Industrial Crafts' School (full-time school) and Fine Arts School (full-time higher education).

The third department was the real ancestor of today’s School of Fine Arts and began to function as a daily school in 1840.  In this department subjects like [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[lithography]], [[woodcut]], [[geometry]] and [[cartography]] were taught. The same year [[Duchess of Plaisance]] who lived in Greece contributed in upgrading the school. She enriched the school's program with new types of painting lessons and called the French painter Bonirote (one of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]'s students) in order to teach oil painting courses. Bonirote was a teacher there until 1843.

In 1843 with royal decree School of Fine Arts was promoted in a five-year study Higher Education School. Director of the School was the famous architect [[Lissandros Kautantzoglou]]. 
During the period 1844–1862 the studies' program was influenced by Europe's Academies of Fine Arts which taught [[neoclassicism]]. 
Some of the great students of this period finally became teachers in the school. Some of them are [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] and [[Nicholaos Gysis]]. 
In 1872, after a donation of [[George Averoff]], a new building in [[Patission Avenue]] road was constructed that was later named [[National Technical University of Athens]].

In 1910 the faculty acquired the independence from the named National Technical University. The same year the first four women were accepted to the School of Fine Arts.

In 1923, the new Director, [[Nikolaos Lytras]] (Nikiphoros' son), reorganized the workshops to give them more independence and promoted newer styles of painting.

In 1930, Education Minister [[Georgios Papandreou]] completely revamped and upgraded the old school, and gave it its current name (Ανώτατη Σχολή Καλών Τεχνών).

In 1929 [[Konstantinos Parthenis]] started teaching in the school. His lessons were mostly about the analysis of [[visual perception]] and the plastic transformation of the incoming visual information. Many other famous artists were occupied in Athens School of Fine Arts: the sculptor [[Costas Dimitriadis]], the engraver [[Yannis Kefallinos]], the writer and historian [[Pantelis Prebelakis]]. Since 1947 [[Yiannis Moralis]], [[Georgios Mauroidis]], [[Constantinos Grammatopoulos]] and [[Spyros Papaloukas]], [[Panayiotis Tetsis]], [[Nikos Kessanlis]], [[Dimitris Mytaras]], [[Georgios Nikolaidis]], [[Ilias Dekoylakos]] and the architect [[Savvas Kontaratos]] taught the principles of [[Modern Greek art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Banhua''' (Chinese: [[wikt:版|版]][[wikt:画|画]]) is the Chinese umbrella term for any [[printmaking|printed]] art objects, and especially for those made by [[woodblock printing]], the term used for [[woodcut]]s from Asia.

==History==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]]

[[Image:LieNuZhuan.jpg|thumb|200px|11th century print of [[Lienü zhuan]]]]

[[Image:Xin quanxiang Sanguo zhipinghua030.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century print of Sanguozhi Pinghua]]

The direct translation of 'Banhua' is 'printed picture', it is a general term for original prints or printmaking as an art form. 'Banhua' is composed of two characters: 'ban' (Chinese: 版) meaning 'block' and 'hua' (Chinese: 画)meaning 'picture'. Banhua's meaning does not limited in prints in Chinese style.

As [[printing]] first appeared in 3rd century China, artists started to use [[woodblock printing]] or other methods to spread their works. Buddhist classics, novel illustrations, and the [[banknote]] were among the first public works to be printed in China.

From the 17th century, prints of [[New Year picture]]s became popular.

''[[Newsweek]]'' noted the film's attempt to market to [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]], [[anti-establishment]] audiences, calling it "a [[Libertarianism in the United Kingdom|libertarian's]] wet dream of [[Ayn Rand|Randian]] proportions", and criticising alleged inconsistencies in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Lowe|first=Josh|date=12 May 2016|title=Brexit: The Movie is a Libertarian's Wet Dream|url=http://www.newsweek.com/brexit-movie-review-nigel-farage-michael-gove-douglas-carswell-eu-referendum-459234|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' criticised the film, stating it relied on [[ethnic stereotypes]] and omitted certain perspectives.

'''''Cadence''''' (also known as Stockade) is a 1990 film directed by (and starring) [[Martin Sheen]], in which [[Charlie Sheen]] plays an [[inmate]] in a [[United States Army]] [[military prison]] in [[West Germany]] during the 1960s.  Sheen plays alongside his father [[Martin Sheen]] and brother [[Ramon Estevez]]. The film is based on a novel by [[Gordon Weaver]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
Franklin Bean (Charlie Sheen) is shown in flashback with his father, a [[postal worker]] at his high school. His poor performance is attributed to a lack of discipline which a school officials assures the elder Bean can be fixed with a stint in the Army. Then, in present day, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Bean is attending his father's funeral before returning to his duty station in Germany. In his state of grief he gets [[drunk]], punches an [[Military police|MP]] and breaks through a plate-glass window in a local bar. Bean's army lawyer secures a plea deal, struck by his attorney Captain Ramon Garcia (Abraham), in lieu of a court martial which involves him removing unauthorized tattoos from his hands (obtained during his drunken rampage), paying for a broken window and serving 90 days in the camp [[stockade]]. He is met at the gates by a decorated Korean War veteran Master Sergeant named Otis McKinney (Martin Sheen). 

McKinney explains that the stockade is fairly small and, as a result, he is in complete charge of the compound while being supported by two guards; Corporals Harold Lamar and Gerald Gessner. Bean finds a sympathetic ear in stockade guard Corporal Lamar after learning he is just as afraid of McKinney and only "serving his own time." Gessner is a somewhat spineless lackey to McKinney whom he clearly admires and respects. 

Bean is introduced to his fellow prisoners, all of them black and led by section leader Roosevelt Stokes (Fishburne). Stokes is serving an unspecified sentence for larceny and, despite his conviction, apparently retains his rank of [[Corporal]]. Bean resists McKinney by refusing to refer to him as [[sergeant]] and refusing most military customs and courtesies. The prisoner detail is regularly trucked to a nearby farm where they perform manual labor such as digging ditches and building fences. While there, Bean becomes obsessed with a nonfunctional and off-limits [[windmill]]. He requests permission to repair the windmill from MSgt McKinney through Corporal Lamar but his request is denied. Bean submits a written request to the commanding officer, secretly bypassing McKinney by passing his request through Lamar, who grants him permission to work on the windmill only during meal breaks. 

Bean challenges fellow inmate Webb, a Harlem born boxer, to a pickup game of basketball after suffering a humiliating loss to him in a fist fight which was initiated after Bean accused Webb of stealing his gold [[zippo]] lighter. Bean agrees to pay Webb $10 if he loses and Webb agrees to help Bean with his windmill project if Bean wins. Bean wins the game and begins building trust and credibility among the other prisoners. Bean begins to connect with the others and learns of some of their crimes. He soon shares a bunk with Bryce (Mankuma), who was convicted of murder despite his pleas to the contrary. Bryce advises that he expects his appeal to fail and to eventually be shipped out of the stockade to be hanged. Lawrence (Toles-Bey), a fellow prisoner who harbors sympathetic views toward the Nation of Islam, reveals that he was convicted of rape and sentenced to seven years though he denies his crime. Among the prisoners is also the largely silent Harry "Sweetbread" Crane (Stewart) who is an inspiring vocalist who sings at church services and leads the prisoners' soulful marching cadence.

In the meantime, McKinney becomes increasingly irritated with Bean's refusal to submit to his authority. It is revealed that he is estranged from his son, whom he states is roughly Bean's age. When McKinney calls his (presumed) ex-wife on his birthday hoping to speak to his son he is told that his son is unavailable, sending McKinney into a drunken bender in the enlisted club. In the middle of the night he tries to break into the prisoner compound to confront Bean while yelling challenges to him. The noise rouses both Lamar and Gessner. Lamar threatens to arrest McKinney and refuses to comply with his order to open the gates. Gessner, however, makes a move to comply but is stopped by Lamar. A fellow sergeant and friend of McKinney arrives on the scene and is warned by Lamar that he will arrest McKinney unless he takes him away immediately and gets him to bed. During a Sunday visit with a friend from his unit, Bean is informed that they are being sent to Vietnam and that he will likely join them there after he is released from the stockade.

McKinney decides to try to use tact with Bean and invites him to his office to talk through their differences while plying him with chocolates, which Bean refuses. Bean states that McKinney is a bully and he hates everything he stands for. McKinney dismisses him and is visibly angry. The next day, while Bean and Webb are nearly finished with the windmill repair, McKinney arrives on the scene with a written order from a Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers to cease all work on the windmill and placing it off limits for all personnel. When McKinney isn't present Webb and Bean return to the windmill to activate it despite the loud protestations from Gessner. 

In the middle of a rainy night, McKinney arrives at the prisoner barracks in rain gear and a combat helmet while holding a rifle. He orders the prisoners into the yard and summons Gessner. He writes up all of the prisoners, and Gessner, for appearing in formation out of uniform as they are all still in their underwear. He orders the men into the back of a [[deuce-and-a-half]] and orders Gessner to drive them to the farm where they normally work. Upon arrival he dismisses Gessner and orders him back to his quarters. When Gessner questions the order, McKinney strikes him sending him face down into the mud. He departs and McKinney begins to march the prisoners in the deep mud, quickly finding that he is unable to keep up with the younger men in the harsh conditions. He orders the prisoners into formation, throws the ammunition clip from his rifle behind him, and tells the men they should run to escape. He then draws his service pistol and begins firing toward the men while shouting incoherently. "Sweetbread" Crane begins wandering toward the windmill and climbing it. McKinney scrambles for his clip, murmuring "help me" as he tries to load his rifle. All the while the prisoners plead with Sweetbread to return and explain to McKinney that he has a tendency to wander off and isn't trying to escape. Sweetbread climbs down from the windmill and begins moving toward McKinney. Bean leaps toward him to try to protect him from McKinney's rifle fire but Sweetbread is struck in the head. Bean removes his shirt to try to stop the bleeding as the other prisoners subdue McKinney, but the wound is fatal. 

It is revealed that the remainder of Bean's sentence has been commuted by the commanding officer. McKinney is court-martialed for the shooting of Crane and is represented by Captain Garcia. Stokes testifies against McKinney and whispers to Bean, as he leaves the witness stand, that they have McKinney "on the gallows." Garcia elicits from Bean the testimony that McKinney said "help me" as he was loading his weapon. He argues that it couldn't possibly have been a muttering to himself as Bean would not have heard it from his distance and that this was actually a call for the prisoners to assist him with Crane. This, he argues, constitutes a "warning shot" and that the killing was lawful. McKinney is presumably cleared, though it is never explicitly stated. Garcia confronts Bean after the proceedings smiling as he tells Bean that he had no choice but to tell the truth otherwise he would have committed perjury. He then assures Bean that he knows how he feels. Bean replies "No sir, you don't" before saluting and attempting to visit the prisoners. Lamar informs him that they don't want to meet with him though he leaves gifts which Lamar promises to convey.

Bean visits McKinney, who despite his acquittal is committed to the base psychiatric unit. McKinney sits motionless in his room in a state of undress and refuses to speak to Bean. When Bean attempts to initiate conversation, McKinney slowly turns in his chair to face away from him. 

As Bean prepares to leave camp to ship to Vietnam to join his unit, he makes peace with Gessner and receives best wishes from Lamar as they march the prisoners. Webb breaks ranks and tosses the stolen lighter to Bean advising him to stick close to the brothers in Vietnam and they'll keep him safe. The prisoners then call the [[chain gang]] cadence that Sweetbread used to call, turning to face Bean in an apparent reconciliation. Bean tearfully joins in the movements and cadence while observing the formation before saluting the men and departing for Vietnam.

{{use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}

A '''cameo role''' or '''cameo appearance''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|i|oʊ}}; often shortened to just '''cameo''') is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the [[performing arts]]. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake) or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[film director]]s, [[politician]]s, [[athlete]]s or [[musician]]s are common. A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|frequently performed cameos]].

==Concept==
Originally "cameo role" meant "a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] connects this with the meaning "a short literary sketch or portrait", which is based on the literal meaning of "[[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]", a miniature carving on a gemstone.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, "Cameo".&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, "cameo" has come to refer to any short appearances, as a character, such as the examples below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cameo in Film topic |url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/Film-topic/cameo |publisher=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English |accessdate=9 January 2017 |quote=a short appearance in a film or play by a well-known actor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity's stature and the film or television series in which they are appearing. Many are [[publicity stunt]]s. Others are acknowledgments of an actor's contribution to an earlier work, as in the case of many [[film adaptation]]s of television series, or of [[remake]]s of earlier films. Others honour artists or celebrities known for work in a particular field.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Possibly the best-known series of cameos was by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who made [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|very brief appearances in most of his films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dirks |first1=Tim |title=Alfred Hitchcock's Film Cameo Appearances in His Own Films |url=http://www.filmsite.org/hitchcockcameos.html |website=Filmsite |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameos also occur in [[novel]]s and other literary works. “Literary cameos” usually involve an established character from another work who makes a brief appearance to establish a [[shared universe]] setting, to make a point, or to offer [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. [[Balzac]] often employed this practice, as in his ''[[La Comédie humaine|Comédie humaine]]''. Sometimes a cameo features a historical person who "drops in" on fictional characters in a [[historical novel]], as when [[Benjamin Franklin]] shares a [[beer]] with Phillipe Charboneau in ''[[The Bastard (novel)|The Bastard]]'' by [[John Jakes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A cameo appearance can be made by the author of a work to put a sort of personal "signature" on a story. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] often put himself in his novels; for instance, the very minor character Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of the author's name) in ''[[Lolita]]''.&lt;ref name="Straumann2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Straumann|first=Barbara|title=Figurations of Exile in Hitchcock and Nabokov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AqrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|year=2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3647-1|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film directors===
{{further|List of directors who appear in their own films}}

[[Quentin Tarantino]] provides cameos or [[Bit part|small roles]] in at least 10 of his movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Alice|last2=Saunders|first2=Tristram Fane|title=Quentin Tarantino: his 10 best cameo roles|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/hateful-eight/quentin-tarantino-best-cameo-roles/|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Peter Jackson]] has made brief cameos in all of his movies, except for his first feature-length film ''[[Bad Taste]]'' in which he plays a main character, as well as ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', though a portrait of him appears in the film. For example, he plays a peasant eating a carrot in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''; a Rohan warrior in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and a Corsair of Umbar boatswain in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''. All four were non-speaking "blink and you miss him" appearances, although in the Extended Release of ''The Return of the King'', his character was given more screen time and his reprise of the carrot eating peasant in The Desolation of Smaug was featured in the foreground in reference to The Fellowship of the Ring - last seen twelve years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sumra|first1=Husain|title=Did you know that Peter Jackson made cameos in the Lord of the Rings films?|url=http://www.swiftfilm.com/did-you-know-that-peter-jackson-made-cameos-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-films/|publisher=Swiftfilm|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Martin Scorsese]] appears in the background of his films as a bystander or an [[unseen character]]. In ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'' (1967), he appears as one of the gangsters; he is a lighting crewman in ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985) and a passenger in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). He opens up his film ''[[The Color of Money]]'' (1986) with a monologue on the art of playing pool. In addition, he appears with his wife and daughter as wealthy New Yorkers in ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', and he appears as a theatre-goer and is heard as a movie projectionist in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In a same way, [[Roman Polanski]] appears as a hired hoodlum in his film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), slitting Jack Nicholson's nose with the blade of his clasp knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Roger|title=Story of the scene: 'Chinatown' Roman Polanski (1974)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/story-of-the-scene-chinatown-roman-polanski-1974-819366.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actors and writers===
Directors sometimes cast well-known lead actors with whom they have worked in the past in other films. [[Mike Todd]]'s film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956) was filled with cameo roles: [[John Gielgud]] as an English butler, [[Frank Sinatra]] playing piano in a saloon, and others. The stars in cameo roles were pictured in oval insets in posters for the film, and gave the term wide circulation outside the theatrical profession.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), an "epic comedy", also features cameos from nearly every popular American comedian alive at the time, including [[The Three Stooges]], [[Jerry Lewis]], a silent appearance by [[Buster Keaton]] and a voice-only cameo by [[Selma Diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sobczynski|first1=Peter|title="It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" Gets the Deluxe Treatment from Criterion|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/its-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world-gets-the-deluxe-treatment-from-criterion|publisher=Roger Ebert|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolific [[writer]] [[Aaron Sorkin]] also have cameos in some films which he scribes. Like as a bar customer speaking about law in his debut film screenplay ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992). As an advertising executive in the [[Fincher]] helmed [[The Social Network]] or as à guest at the inauguration of President [[Matt Santos]] in final episode "Tomorrow" of his created television series ''[[The West Wing]]''.

[[Franco Nero]], the actor who portrayed the Django character in the original [[Django (1966 film)|1966]] film appears in a bar scene of the Tarantino film ''[[Django Unchained]]''; where he asked Django (immaculately played by [[Jamie Foxx]]) to spell his name, which births the famous promotional tagline for the film - "The 'D' is silent"

Among the many cameos featured in ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (1994), (directed by [[Richard Donner]]), [[Danny Glover]] ([[Mel Gibson]]'s co-star in the ''[[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'' [[Media franchise|franchise]] of films also directed by Donner) appears as the lead [[bank robber]]. He and Maverick (Gibson) share a scene where they look as if they knew each other, but then shake it off. As Glover makes his escape with the [[money]], he mutters "I'm too old for this shit", his character's [[catchphrase]] in the ''Lethal Weapon'' film series. In addition, a strain of the main [[Theme (music)|theme]] from ''Lethal Weapon'' plays in the [[Film score|score]] when Glover is revealed. Actress [[Margot Kidder]] made a cameo appearance in the same film as a [[Robbery|robbed]] villager, and the actress previously starred as [[Lois Lane]] in one of Donner's earlier films ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name=RevEbert&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert| first=Roger | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940520/REVIEWS/405200302 |  title=Maverick | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] | date=20 May 1994 |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Stiller]], [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Luke Wilson]] and [[Will Ferrell]] have made appearances in so many of the same films (whether as lead characters or cameos) ''[[USA Today]]'' coined the term  the "[[Frat Pack]]" to name the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |title=Wilson and Vaughn: Leaders of the 'Frat Pack' |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-15-frat-pack_x.htm |date=15 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Adam Sandler]] is also known for frequently casting fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performers (including [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]]) in various roles in his films (as well as making cameo appearances of his own in theirs, most of which he co-produces). [[Sam Raimi]] frequently uses his brother [[Ted Raimi|Ted]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] in his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsters-movies.com/sam_raimi.htm|title=Monsters-Movies.com|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/workedwith|title=Sam Raimi - Credited with|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American singer/actress [[Cher]] has done a couple of cameos over the years. She did two cameos in ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' and she even did a few in the 1990s.

Actor [[Edward Norton]] appears as himself in the satirical film ''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'' which stars [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

An extended cameo of ace actor [[Al Pacino]] is seen in the [[Adam Sandler]] starring film ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'' where [Pacino] plays a fictionalised version of himself.

The mangaka [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] made many cameos in his [[Kamen Rider]] series&lt;ref&gt;https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori#Cameo_in_Kamen_Rider_Series&lt;/ref&gt;.

The animated series ''[[Adventures of Tintin]]'' featured its author [[Hergé]] in all the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talbot|first1=John|last2=Adams|first2=Edmund|last3=Winkels|first3=Rob|last4=Mar|first4=Irene|title=Hergé's Cameo Appearances|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/guides/lists/hergecameos.html|website=Tintinologist|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10.14.11StanLeeByLuigiNovi9.jpg|thumb|[[Stan Lee]] was well known for his cameo appearances throughout most of the [[List of films based on Marvel Comics|Marvel films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/every-stan-lee-cameo-2016-2|title=Stan Lee has made 28 cameos in Marvel movies and shows — here they are|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]'', a drama about how the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' began, features many [[An Adventure in Space and Time#Cast|actors from the show's past]], including two past companions in a party scene, another as a mother calling her children in for dinner and a fourth in a car park at the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Dan |title=Doctor Who: 17 things for Who fans to spot in An Adventure in Space and Time by Mark Gatiss |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/21/doctor-who-17-things-for-who-fans-to-spot-in-an-adventure-in-space-and-time-by-mark-gatiss-4191651/ |publisher=Metro|accessdate=15 September 2016 |date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: Please do not add examples here, unless they illustrate something new; everything must be cited --&gt;

===Real-life people===
Films based on actual events occasionally include cameo [[guest appearance]]s by the people portrayed in them. In ''[[The Pursuit of Happyness]]'', [[Chris Gardner]] makes a cameo at the end. ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', a film about [[Tony Wilson]], has a cameo by the real Tony Wilson and many other notable people. In the film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] (the real commander of that flight) and his wife Marilyn appear next to the actors playing them ([[Tom Hanks]] and [[Kathleen Quinlan]] respectively).

===Chinese View Art Association (1986-1989)===
[[File:Chinese_View_Art_Festival_'86_programme,_front.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Programme for the Chinese View '86 festival organised by the CVAA in 1986]]
&lt;p&gt;The '''Chinese View Art Association''' (CVAA) was established in 1986 by a group of Manchester based artist of Chinese descent to foster a positive understanding of Chinese identity and culture within the local Chinese community and the general British public.&lt;ref name= 'Aesthetica 2015'&gt;{{Citation

===Chinese Art Centre, Edge Street, (1997-2003)===
&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1990s, the ethos of the Chinese Art Centre was reviewed after its funding from the North West Arts Board was almost halved.&lt;ref name="1997 accounts"&gt;{{cite web

Champion, appointed Director of the Centre in November 1997, oversaw the Centre's move to new premises at Edge Street in Manchester’s Northern Quarter in January 1997 and the Centre's transition to a contemporary arts venue.&lt;ref name= 'Kennedy 2015'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important time in the development of the Centre; the Hong Kong handover saw much focus on Chinese culture in the British media. This dramatic increase in mainstream recognition of all things Chinese encouraged the centre to change direction and, rather than just exhibiting work, proactively support the careers of artists of Chinese descent. In addition, 1997 marked the year that the organisation extended its remit to become a national charity and started to work internationally, rather than just with British Chinese artists.
In 1999 Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art produced ''Representing the People'' - its first major touring exhibition. Touring to four key national venues and seen by 250,000 people, Representing the People was the first independent exhibition to show artists from Mainland China in the UK.&lt;ref name= 'Aesthetica 2015'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In 2010, Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art organised a Liberation Exhibition - an [[exhibition]] growing out of an ongoing discussion with [[Carol Yinghua Lu]] and [[Liu Ding]] following the blocked use of a selection of [[social networking]] and [[self-publishing]] websites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfcca.org.uk/http:/www.cfcca.org.uk/main-gallery/liberation/|publisher=chinese-arts-centre.org|title=Liberation Exhibition|accessdate=2010-09-08|author=Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This exhibition takes the form of a [[visual art]] exhibition as well as a series of events, a debate, and a [[blog]] discussion among the curators of the exhibition and invited guests. Speakers at the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art discussed a range of perspectives on the online media and the power of [[social networking]] sites. Guest speakers include exhibiting artist [[Brendan Fan]], [[FaceRook]] artist [[Candy Chen Shuhui]], [[Laurence Kaye]] from [[Pirate Party UK]], [[Matthew Trump]] from the [[Northern Cybercrime Forensics Group]], and [[Tom Kinniburgh]], Associate Producer of the [[Application software|Application]] Company [[Chillingo]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liberationtalk.eventbrite.com/|publisher=eventbrite.com|title=Liberation Talk|accessdate=2010-09-08|author=Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It proposes a close look into the openness and potential of the Internet world as well as its susceptibility to power and political manipulation and ideological controls.

'''''Dance of Death''''' is the thirteenth studio album by English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], released first in Japan on 2 September and then 8 September 2003 in the rest of the world excluding North America (where it was released a day later). The album was recorded on magnetic (analogue) tape.&lt;ref name="dotr"/&gt;

Their second studio release since the return of vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the album features the band's first-ever fully acoustic track, "Journeyman", as well as "New Frontier", their only song co-written by drummer [[Nicko McBrain]]. As with ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'', its predecessor in 2000, the record was produced by [[Kevin Shirley]], who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.&lt;!-- as of when? --&gt;

==Background==
The band first confirmed that they would be working on a follow-up to 2000's ''Brave New World'' with producer [[Kevin Shirley]] on 27 November 2002, announced alongside a small set of European tour dates for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-announce-european-dates/ |title=Iron Maiden announce 2003 European dates |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=28 November 2002 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2003, Shirley confirmed via his website that the band would begin recording that month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/producer-iron-maiden-to-begin-recording-this-month/ |title=Iron Maiden To Begin Recording This Month |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=6 January 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the announcement that the basic tracks had been completed on 5 February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-complete-basic-tracks-for-new-cd/ |title=Iron Maiden Complete Basic Tracks for New CD |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=5 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the release was to be mixed in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-begin-mixing-in-april/ |title=Iron Maiden to Begin Mixing in April |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=21 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May, the band announced that the album, recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]], would be entitled ''Dance of Death'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-new-album-details-unveiled/ |title=Iron Maiden: New Album Details Unveiled |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the release date was issued on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-tour-europe-in-the-fall/ |title=Iron Maiden Announce European Tour and Release Date |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=29 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band undertook the [[Dance of Death World Tour]] in support of the album, which included many theatrical elements inspired by the record's songs. During "Dance of Death", Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the [[Grim Reaper]] for the final chorus.&lt;ref name="Wall380"/&gt; During "Paschendale", Dickinson would wear a traditional British Infantryman trench coat and helmet (although he revealed in the ''Death on the Road'' documentary that it was actually Hungarian),&lt;ref name="dotr"&gt;{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Documentary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as worn during World War I, and the set would be decorated with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="Wall380"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=380 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour led to a live album and DVD, entitled ''[[Death on the Road]]'', released in 2005 and 2006.

The [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated]] cover art was provided by David Patchett,&lt;ref name= "patchett"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Iron Maiden  |authorlink1=Iron Maiden| title = [[From Fear to Eternity (album)|From Fear to Eternity]] Booklet | chapter = Album List: ''Dance of Death'' | publisher = [[EMI]]| date = 6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who allegedly asked for his name to be removed from the album's credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Porter |first=Tom |title=Iron Maiden: a gruesome history of graphic artwork |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/iron-maiden-a-gruesome-history-of-graphic-artwork-248809/61 |publisher=[[MusicRadar]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was received negatively.&lt;ref name= "SputnikMusic"/&gt; Dickinson later called the cover "embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006818916|title=What does this button do? : Bruce Dickinson : an autobiography.|last=1958-|first=Dickinson, Bruce,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780008172435|location=London|pages=301|oclc=1006818916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released as a [[DVD-Audio]] disc in 2004, including 5.1 mixes of each song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmaiden.com/iron-maiden-release-special-souvenir-ep.html |title=Iron Maiden release special souvenir EP | date=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
[[File:Nicko McBrain 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] made his song writing debut on ''Dance of Death''.]]
''Dance of Death'' is the only Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] has a songwriting credit, having co-written "New Frontier".&lt;ref name="Wall374"/&gt; As a born-again Christian, the track expresses his concerns with human cloning, stating, "I personally believe that God created man and it's only God's right to create a human being because only He can give you a soul. When man attempts to make man then it's a monster in a test tube."&lt;ref name="Wall374"/&gt; This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a songwriting credit.

"Montségur" was based on the fall of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] stronghold [[Montségur|of the same name]], which fell in the aftermath of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in 1244.&lt;ref name="Wall373"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=373 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson, who wrote the song's lyrics, states, "There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history that you can make parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter."&lt;ref name="Wall373"/&gt;

"Paschendale" is about the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] which took place during the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was written by [[Adrian Smith]], who usually contributes to the band's shorter, more commercial-sounding songs, but decided to write what he describes as "a traditional Maiden epic".&lt;ref name="Wall375"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=375 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features strong [[progressive rock]] elements, including its length, detailed structure, and multiple tempo changes throughout the song. Dickinson comments, "the beauty of 'Paschendale' isn't in the epic-ness of the song – although you have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail."&lt;ref name="Wall375"/&gt; In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from [[Wilfred Owen]]'s "[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]".&lt;ref name="Wall380"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Iain|title=From Achilles to Alexander: The Classical World and the World of Metal|journal=Heavy Metal Music in Britain|date=March 2009|page=118|editor1-first=Gerd|editor1-last=Bayer|location=London|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iron Maiden Newcastle, July 23rd 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Iron Maiden performing "Dance of Death" in 2011]]

According to guitarist [[Janick Gers]], the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', at the end of which "these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death".&lt;ref name="Wall373" /&gt; Gers wrote most of the music and explained the concept to [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], who wrote the lyrics and most of the melodies.&lt;ref name="Wall374"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=374 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Face in the Sand" is based on the media coverage surrounding the [[Iraq War]], taking place as the album was being recorded.&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; Dickinson explains, "I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, the best thing you can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand."&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a [[Double bass drumming#Double bass drum|double bass pedal]].&lt;ref name="Wall375" /&gt;

The final track, "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's first and only fully [[acoustic music|acoustic]] song. According to Dickinson on the ''Death on the Road'' live album, it is about "the whole process of writing and being a musician",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Journeyman |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Mick Wall]] describes it as "a wistful tale of ''[[carpe diem]]''".&lt;ref name="Wall376"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=376 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field."&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; The original version appears on the ''[[No More Lies (EP)|No More Lies]]'' EP.

Reviews for the album were generally positive with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' describing it as "stupendous stuff and concrete proof that Maiden are as electrifying and important as they have been in a long time".&lt;ref name= "Kerrang!"/&gt; [[Sputnikmusic]] were also positive about the album, giving special mention to "Paschendale", described as "quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece".&lt;ref name= "SputnikMusic"/&gt; Although deeming the first three songs "refreshing yet unremarkable", [[AllMusic]] describes ''Dance of Death'' as "a triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends."&lt;ref name= "AM"/&gt;

Although criticising the album for its length and for not "matching the quality" of its predecessor, ''Brave New World'', [[PopMatters]] praised the band for being able to "still easily outclass most of the younger nu-metal bands today".&lt;ref name= "PopMatters"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1201">'''Decadentism''' (also called '''Decadentismo''') was an Italian artistic style based mainly on the [[Decadent movement]] in the arts in France and England around the end of the 19th century.  The main authors associated with decadentism were [[Antonio Fogazzaro]], [[Italo Svevo]], [[Giovanni Pascoli]] and [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].  Although differing stylistically, they championed idiosyncrasy and irrationality against scientific rationalism.  A later critic, [[Walter Binni]], analyzed the style favorably in his 1936 book ''La poetica del decadentismo'' and distinguished between moral and aesthetic decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Drake | first = Richard | year = 1982 | title = Decadence, Decadentism, and Decadent Romanticism in Italy: Toward a Theory of ''Décadence'' | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 17 | pages = 69–92 | doi = 10.1177/002200948201700104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another scholar of decadentism was [[Norberto Bobbio]], noted especially for his 1945 book, ''La filosofia del decadentismo''.

The '''Garraffo Fountain''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Fontana del Garraffo''') is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] fountain of [[Palermo]]. It is located in [[Piazza Marina]], down the [[Cassaro, Palermo|Cassaro]] street, within the historic centre of Palermo.

The name of the fountain comes from the [[Arabic]] word "''Gharraf''", meaning the abundance of water. It was sculpted by [[Gioacchino Vitagliano]] in 1698, although the design was previously realized by the architect [[Paolo Amato]]. The sculpture represents an abundance goddess riding an eagle fighting against a [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]].

The location of the Garraffo fountain was in the market of the [[Vucciria]], in front of the monument called [[Genio del Garraffo]], until 1862, when it was shifted to Piazza Marina.

== Features ==
There are several methodologies for indexing:&lt;ref name="software"/&gt;
* [[Index (publishing)#Embedded indexing|Embedded indexing]] includes the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.
* '''Tagging''' allow indexing codes to be embedded in the text after the indexing is complete. The indexer inserts numbered dummy tags in the files, and then builds the index separately
* Most [[Word processor]]s have integrated automated indexing functions. These tools build a concordance or word lists from processed files. They have often limited usage.

The '''International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam''' (IABR) is a bi-annual international event bringing together international knowledge and experience in various design disciplines (architecture, urban planning and landscape architecture), and presenting this knowledge and experience to a broader audience.

Unlike other events such as the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]], the IABR is a thematically designed research biennal; each edition addresses a pressing issue, from the perspective of current (Dutch) practices within an international context, and always with a focus on the future of the city. 

The IABR implements its agenda by means of international research projects, exhibitions, master classes, workshops, conferences, lectures, debates, essays, a website, blogs, a catalogue, book, brochures, film, DVD, etc. Since the fourth edition, in 2009, the IABR has increasingly combined its research projects with concrete urban planning assignments. Particularly in the cities of Rotterdam, Istanbul and São Paulo, the biennale is actively  involved in the actual development of the city.

The 7th edition of the IABR, THE NEXT ECONOMY–, opens in April 2016.

==Biennale Editions==
* 2003 - Mobility: A Room with a View, curator [[Francine Houben]] (Mecanoo)

[[File:Rete ferroviaria Libia Italiana.png|thumb|right|The five railways in Italian Libya.]]

'''Italian Libya Railways''' was a group of small railways built in the [[History of Libya as Italian colony|Italian colony of Libya]] between the two World Wars.

==History==
The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] built in [[Italian Libya]] nearly 400&amp;nbsp;km of railways with {{track gauge|950mm|lk=on|al=on}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orsomax.com/OEA/OEAvillaggi3.htm |title=Orsomax OEA villaggi |publisher=Orsomax.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Italian authorities decided to give priority to the construction of [[road]]s in Libya when [[Benito Mussolini]] took control of the Italian colonies. After 1926 no more railways were made in Libya, but during [[World War II]] the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with [[History of Egypt under the British|British Egypt]] changed this approach.

In spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway between Tripoli and [[Benghazi]], but by the end of 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa: only 18&amp;nbsp;km were done in Cirenaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf Le ferrovie coloniali italiane in Libia (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063813/http://www.gips.unisi.it/files/wp18.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
In Libya the first locomotives were the [[steam locomotives]] R.401 and R.301, but the most successful were the R.302 produced in [[northern Italy]].

==Railways==
There were only five small railways:

1) Tripoli-Zuara (118&amp;nbsp;km):

== Plot ==
The film's opening explains that in 1994 a [[web series]] called ''Murder'', which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, ''Murder'' was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible [[new media]] has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can."

* '''Bludgeoning:''' A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's [[webcam]].
* '''The Heist:''' A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back.
* '''The Cheat:''' In front of a stationary camera a man, Greg reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an ax before cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him.
* '''S&amp;G:''' A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman.
* '''Broadway Rob:''' The distorted home movie of a pedophile, Broadway Rob who forces two gagged boys, Shawn and Ben clad in only their socks and underwear to dance with him. Shawn tackles Rob, fatally strangling and stabbing him. Shawn and Ben flee, leaving Rob's dead body behind.
* '''Execution:''' A muffled black and white [[camcorder]] video of a hooded and masked group (possibly a [[cult]] or a gang) executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, whom they taunt with the severed head before shooting her.
* '''ATM:''' A man is mugged and killed at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].
* '''Autopsy:''' Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, with the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually kicks the cameraman out due to his unprofessional antics and inattentiveness.
* '''Bullied:''' A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out into the woods under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man and, during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The trio panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a fight breaks out over whether they should go for help.
* '''Homecoming:''' A building security camera records two figures [[Garrote|garroting]] a man.
* '''Ransom:''' A deteriorated series of [[ransom]] videos depict three men brutalizing a [[Senate|senator's]] daughter, who eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries.

After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, "You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?"

== Reception ==
Ryan Doom of [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]] gave ''Murder Collection V.1'' a 2/4 and wrote, "In the end, I think it's an interesting exercise, but I don't know if it makes it a good movie. This isn't the type of film that I suspect most viewers would revisit often, if at all. Instead, it's just an experiment that people will dig or not, depending on how much violence and gore they can stomach without a story for context. While it captivated me at times with certain segments, others seemed unnecessary or overdone. But maybe that's just me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/murder-collection-v1|title = ''Murder Collection V.1''|last = Doom|first = Ryan|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror News's Jay Alan praised the special effects, also calling the acting "convincingly believable for the most part" and writing, "As much as the film focuses on the graphic and dark nature of death, it also delves into the human psyche and personalities of the characters within the little given time shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/30431/film-review-murder-collection-vol-1-2009/|title = Film Review: ''Murder Collection Vol. 1'' (2009)|last = Alan|first = Jay|publisher = Horror News|date = 2 November 2011|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Nativity of the Virgin''''' is a  painting by the  German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], dating to c. 1520, which is currently housed in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

==Description==
The work uses a scenic composition typical of the [[Danube school]] of the time. The subject, the birth of Mary, is shown in a secondary location of the lower part of the painting. It includes St. Anne's bed, the midwives with the daughter and St. Joachim riding a stair with something in his hand.  

The predominant part of the work is the church background, where angels fly to form a large circle: in the middle is a young angel with a [[thurible]] for the incense.
 
The edifice, symbolizing the analogy between Mary and the Catholic church (a subject later abolished by the [[Protestant Reformation]]), is organized in a complicated and original fashion: the [[ambulatory (architecture)|ambulatory]] and the  column galleries are [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], the ogival windows are [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], the vaults and the shell-shaped niches are  in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]]. This attention to architectural elements was typical of Altdorfer's work in the period he spent at the court of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].

The '''Neue Galerie New York''' ([[German language|German]] for: ''"New Gallery"'') is a museum of early twentieth-century German and Austrian art and design located in the [[William Starr Miller House]] at [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Street]] and [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]]. Established in 2001, it is one of the most recent additions to New York City's famed [[Museum Mile, New York City|Museum Mile]], which runs from 83rd to 105th streets on [[Fifth Avenue]] in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].

==History==
The museum was first conceived by two close friends: art dealer and museum exhibition organizer Serge Sabarsky, and entrepreneur, philanthropist, and art collector [[Ronald S. Lauder]].  The two men shared a passionate commitment to early twentieth-century German and Austrian art and design. They met in 1967, just before Sabarsky opened his Serge Sabarsky Gallery at 987 [[Madison Avenue]].  Almost immediately, the gallery earned a reputation as New York’s leading gallery for Austrian and German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] art. Lauder was a frequent visitor and client. Over the years, the two men discussed opening a museum to showcase the very best work from the period. When Sabarsky died in 1996, Lauder chose to carry on the task of creating Neue Galerie New York, as a tribute to his friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Serge Sabarsky, 83, Art Dealer And Expert on Expressionism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/26/arts/serge-sabarsky-83-art-dealer-and-expert-on-expressionism.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1996 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The collection of the Neue Galerie is divided into two sections. The second floor of the museum houses works of fine art and decorative art from early twentieth-century Austria, including paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], and [[Egon Schiele]] and decorative objects by the artisans of the [[Wiener Werkstaette]] and their contemporaries. The third floor exhibits various German works from the same era, including art movements such as ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' (The Blue Rider), ''[[Die Brücke]]'' (The Bridge), and the [[Bauhaus]]. Featured artists on this floor include [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Lyonel Feininger]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[George Grosz]].

In 2006, Lauder purchased Klimt's painting ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' from [[Maria Altmann]] on behalf of the Neue Galerie.  Citing a confidentiality agreement, Lauder would only confirm that the purchase price was more than the last record price of [[US$]]104.2 million US for [[Picasso]]'s 1905 ''[[Garçon à la pipe|Boy With a Pipe]]''.  The press reported the price for the Klimt at US$135 million, which would make it at that time the [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive painting]] ever sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauder Pays $135 Million, a Record, for a Klimt Portrait |first=Carol |last=Vogel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/arts/design/19klim.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been on display at the museum since July 2006.

==Facility==
The museum is housed in the former [[William Starr Miller House]], a [[Louis XIII style|Louis XIII]]/[[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] structure located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. The Neue Galerie opened there on November 16, 2001. Selldorf Architects was responsible for the complete renovation and conversion into a museum.

In addition to its gallery spaces, the museum also contains a bookstore, design shop, and two [[Viennese café]]s, "Café Sabarsky" and "Café Fledermaus", both of which are operated by restaurateur [[Kurt Gutenbrunner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kg-ny.com/|title=KG-NY :: The Restaurant Group of Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner :: New York, New York|work=kg-ny.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pavel Aleksandrovich Svedomsky''' ({{lang-ru|Павел Александрович Сведомский}}; 7 June 1849, [[Saint-Petersburg]]—27 August 1904, [[Rome]]) was a Russian painter and the brother of another artist, [[Alexander Svedomsky]].

Pavel Svedomsky studied first in the [[Düsseldorf]] Academy of Arts, then in [[Munich]] under [[Eduard von Gebhardt]] and [[Mihály Munkácsy]].

==Life==
[[File:Svedomsky-Fulvia.jpg|thumb|350px|''[[Fulvia]] With the Head of [[Cicero]]'']]
Svedomsky belonged to hereditary [[Russian nobility]]. Together with his brother he spent the childhood in the family estate Mikhaylovski Zavod, located in the [[Perm]] [[Guberniya]]. In 1870 Pavel entered the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts, but studied there only few months. The Svedomskys traveled together across Europe until settling in Rome in 1875. He died there in 1904 and is buried with his brother Alexander in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protestantcemetery.it/graves/databases.html Non-Catholic Cemetery in Rome databases: Swedomsky Paolo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207015655/http://www.protestantcemetery.it/graves/databases.html |date=February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavel Svedomsky painted in various genres, most notably in historic. The painting ''Medusa'' (1882) was bought by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] to be displayed in [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://diaghilev.u-education.ru/svedom/content/files/page5.html# СВЕДОМСКИЙ ПАВЕЛ АЛЕКСАНДРОВИЧ] Diaghilev.u-education.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], Svedosmky painted the northern and southern [[nave]]s of the cathedral, creating six scenes from the life of [[Jesus]]: ''The Resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'', ''The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'', ''The [[Last Supper]]'', ''The [[Agony in the Garden]]'', ''The Trial of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]'', ''The Crucifixion'' and ''The Ascension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.rulex.ru/01180056.htm Сведомские (художники)] Rulex.ru&lt;/ref&gt; During his later years Svedomsky turned to Russian subjects, painting ''The Poor Bride'', ''The Fool in Christ'', ''The Fire of Moscow, 1812'' (1879) and ''The Execution of [[Yermak]]''.

The works of Svedomsky are scattered across various central and regional museums. The Tretyakov Gallery houses five of his paintings, while the Perm State Art Gallery holds a sketch for the church painting ''Procession of the Cross'', as well as ''Two Roman Women With Tambourine and Flute''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7147">The '''Poetry Society of America''' is a literary organization founded in 1910 by poets, editors, and artists. It is the oldest poetry organization in the United States. Past members of the society have included such renowned writers as [[Witter Bynner]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. 

==History==
In 1910, the Poetry Society of America held its first official meeting in the [[National Arts Club]] in [[Manhattan]], which is still home to the organization today. [[Jesse Rittenhouse]], a founding member and Secretary of the PSA, documented the founding of the Poetry Society of America in her autobiography ''My House of Life'' writing "It was not, however, to be an organization in the formal sense of the word, but founded upon the salon idea, a place where poets would gather to read and discuss their work and that of their contemporaries, the group to be united largely through the hospitality of our hosts at whose apartments it was proposed we should continue to meet...When, after much enthusiastic speech-making, a committee was appointed to retire and discuss the details, I had no hesitancy in saying—though at the risk of seeming ungrateful to our hosts—that it was much too big an idea to be narrowed down to a social function, into which it would inevitably deteriorate, and if the Society were developed at all, it ought to be along national lines, and should meet in a public rather than a private place." &lt;ref&gt;Jesse Rittenhouse, ''My House of Life'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first few years, poets such as [[Amy Lowell]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[W.B. Yeats]] regularly attended meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Poets &amp; Writers, "Poetry Society Celebrates Centennial."  May/June 2010 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry In Motion==
In 1992 the Poetry Society launched [[Poetry in Motion (arts program)|Poetry in Motion]] along with  the New York City [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] in the New York City subway system, a program which has since placed poetry in the transit systems of over 20 cities throughout the country such as: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Portland, and Salt Lake City. The program has been honored with numerous awards including a Design for Transportation Merit Award, the New York Municipal Society's Certificate of Merit, and in 2000 a proclamation from the Council of the City of New York that honored the program for its "invaluable contribution to the people of New York City." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.info/mta/pim/ten.htm MTA Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Establishment of the Pulitzer Prize==
The Poetry Society was instrumental in the establishment of a [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]]. In 1917, after the first Pulitzer prizes were awarded, Society member Edward J. Wheeler petitioned the President of Columbia University to include poetry as an award category. After receiving a reply from the President that there had been no funds allocated to award a prize in poetry, Wheeler secured $500 on behalf of the Society from a New York City art patron in order to establish the prize.  The Poetry Society continued to provide this support until 1922 when Columbia University as well as the Pulitzer Board, voted to regularize a Pulitzer Prize in Poetry.&lt;ref&gt;The Pulitzer Prize Archive, vol. 11: Poetry / Verse Awards 1918-1995. Edited by Heinz-Dietrich Fischer (K G Saur Munchen, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray&lt;!-- Please do not change to Raymond - it is unreferenced and incorrect - confirmed at OTRS 2016100910006885--&gt; Douglas Bradbury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|d|b|ər|i}}; August 22, 1920{{spaced ndash}}June 5, 2012) was an American [[author]] and [[screenwriter]]. He worked in a variety of genres, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], and [[mystery fiction]].

Widely known for his [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), and his science-fiction and horror-story collections, ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950), ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951), and ''[[I Sing the Body Electric (short story collection)|I Sing the Body Electric]]'' (1969), Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th- and 21st-century American writers. While most of his best known work is in [[speculative fiction]], he also wrote in other genres, such as the coming-of-age novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' (1957) and the fictionalized memoir ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'' (1992).

Recipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Citation]], Bradbury also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including ''[[Moby Dick (1956)|Moby Dick]]'' and ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''. Many of his works were adapted to comic book, television, and film formats.

Upon his death in 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream".&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|title=Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/books/ray-bradbury-popularizer-of-science-fiction-dies-at-91.html|date=June 6, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|left|Bradbury as a senior in high school, 1938]]

Although he was named after Rae Williams, a cousin on his father's side, Ray Bradbury's birth certificate spells his first name as "Ray".&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the middle name "Douglas" after the actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. Bradbury was related to the American [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholar Douglas Spaulding&lt;ref&gt;The Spaulding Family Memorial, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; and descended from [[Mary Bradbury]], who was tried at one of the [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jonathan|title=Becoming Ray Bradbury|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|page=202|isbn=0252036298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury". Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition" 2001:1–5. EBSCO. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes "Green Town", Illinois.

The Bradbury family lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]], during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40, which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week. This meant that they could stay, and Bradbury—who was in love with Hollywood—was ecstatic.&lt;!--TONE!--&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury attended [[Los Angeles High School]] and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer [[Ray Harryhausen]] and radio star [[George Burns]]. Bradbury's first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the '' [[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/18/ray-bradbury-has-the-most-amazing-dreams-i-write-screenplays-he-says-with-a-wink-in-the-middle-of-the-night-when-he-wa/ Ray Bradbury's close encounters with W.C.

==Influences==

===Literature===
Throughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton. American Writers Supplement IV. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and knew at a young age that he was "going into one of the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury| title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203| last=Weller| first=Sam| date=2010-01-01| newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 11 (1931), during the [[Great Depression]] — sometimes writing on the only available paper, butcher paper.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In his youth, he spent much time in the [[List of Carnegie libraries in Illinois|Carnegie library]] in Waukegan, reading such authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|last=Weller|first=Sam|date=2010-01-01|newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to comics, he loved [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], creator of ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Authors Online. ''Ray Bradbury''. Detroit: Gale, 2009. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; especially Burroughs' [[John Carter of Mars]] series. ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]'' impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Terry. Magill's Survey of American Literature. Revised Edition. Pasadena: Salem Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer [[Bob Olsen]], sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]].&lt;ref&gt;The article linked appears in the source, but this name conflicts with the group's web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Excited to find there were others sharing his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Big Read| url=http://www.neabigread.org/books/fahrenheit451/fahrenheit451_04.php| publisher=Neabigread.org| accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury cited H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, "He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury interview – The art of Fiction No. 203] ''The Paris Review''; Spring, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading science-fiction books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included [[Alexander Pope]] and poet [[John Donne]].&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, "He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

In young adulthood Bradbury read stories published in ''Astounding Science Fiction'', and read everything by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the early writings of [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]].

===Hollywood===
The family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for [[MGM]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, "hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious." Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were [[Norma Shearer]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Ronald Colman]]. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of [[Paramount Pictures]] or [[Columbia Pictures]] and then skated to the [[Brown Derby]] to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing [[Cary Grant]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], and [[Mae West]], whom he learned made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_playboy.html |title=About Ray Bradbury Interview|work=Playboy|year= 1996|author=Ken Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury relates the following meeting with [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], director of Soviet epic film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:

{{quote|They formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people: "Oh Mr. Ford, I like your film." He recognized the director, Greta Garbo, and someone else. I was standing at the very end of the queue and silently watched this. Bondarchuk shouted to me; "Ray Bradbury, is that you?" He rushed up to me, embraced me, dragged me inside, grabbed a bottle of [[Stolichnaya]], sat down at his table where his closest friends were sitting. All the famous Hollywood directors in the queue were bewildered. They stared at me and asked each other "Who is this Bradbury?" And, swearing, they left, leaving me alone with Bondarchuk...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/06/06/ray_bradbury_russians_have_an_unparalleled_capacity_for_love_15822.html|title=Ray Bradbury: "Russians have an unparalleled capacity for love"|publisher=Russia Beyond The Headlines |website=www.rbth.ru|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
[[File:Amazing stories 194412.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bradbury's "Undersea Guardians" was the cover story for the December 1944 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Bradbury's first published story was "[[Hollerbochen's Dilemma]]", which appeared in the January 1938 number of [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest J. Ackerman's]] [[fanzine]] ''Imagination!''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; In July 1939, Ackerman and his then-girlfriend [[Morojo]] gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|First World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[New York City]], and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled ''[[Futuria Fantasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raybradbury.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000825.html Marguerite bradbury – Ray Bradbury Discussion] Ray Bradbury Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to [[Rob Wagner]]'s film magazine, ''Script''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|work=The Paris Review|date=Spring 2010|author=Sam Weller }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was free to start a career in writing, when owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected admission into the military during [[World War II]]. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Buck Rogers]], Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to attend the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]], which at the time met at [[Clifton's Cafeteria]] in downtown Los Angeles. This was where he met the writers [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Emil Petaja]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Leigh Brackett]], and [[Jack Williamson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1939, Bradbury joined [[Laraine Day]]'s Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, "so incredibly bad" that he gave up playwriting for two decades.&lt;ref name="bradbury1972"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Veldt|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|author=Bradbury, Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury| year=1972| location=Woodstock, Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YP_awFRqToC&amp;pg=PA4| page=4| isbn=1-58342-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury's first paid piece, "Pendulum", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine ''Super Science Stories'' in November 1941, for which he earned $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Bradbury-Raymond-Douglas| title=Biographies: Bradbury, Raymond Douglas|publisher=s9.com|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury sold his first story, "The Lake", for $13.75 at 22, and became a full-time writer by 24.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; His first collection of short stories, ''[[Dark Carnival (short story collection)|Dark Carnival]]'', was published in 1947 by [[Arkham House]], a small press in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]], owned by writer [[August Derleth]]. Reviewing ''Dark Carnival'' for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Will Cuppy]] proclaimed Bradbury "suitable for general consumption" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuppy, Will, "Review of Dark Carnival," ''New York Herald Tribune Books'', May 25, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rejection notice from the pulp ''[[Weird Tales]]'', Bradbury submitted "Homecoming" to ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named [[Truman Capote]]. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. ''Homecoming'' won a place in the [[O. Henry Award]] Stories of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/ray-bradbury-from-truman-capote-to-a-t-m-s/ Ray Bradbury, From Truman Capote to A.T.M.’s], by Dean Robinson – 6th floor; ''The New York Times'', June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[UCLA]]'s [[Powell Library]], in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a [[book burning]] future, ''The Fireman'', which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name ''Fahrenheit 451'', for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A Bruin Birthday Tribute To Ray Bradbury Tweet|url=http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|title=First Spark: Ray Bradbury Turns 90; The Universe and UCLA Academy Celebrate|publisher=Spotlight.ucla.edu|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005161805/http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer [[Christopher Isherwood]] gave Bradbury the opportunity to put ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood's glowing review&lt;ref name="CI50"&gt;{{Citation| last=Isherwood| first=Christopher| author-link=Christopher Isherwood| title=A Review of ''The Martian Chronicles''| journal=Tomorrow| volume=10| pages=56–58| date=October 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed.

==Writing==
Bradbury attributed two incidents to his lifelong habit of writing every day. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s performance in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury." Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition (2001): UFO. November 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, "Live forever!"&lt;ref name="IHW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html|title=In His Words| publisher=RayBradbury.com| accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury remarked, "I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico...[he] gave me a future...I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago."&lt;ref name="IHW"/&gt; At that age, Bradbury first started to do [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Sanders' film Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers [[Robert Frost]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. From Steinbeck, he said he learned "how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment". He studied [[Eudora Welty]] for her "remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included [[Katherine Anne Porter]], who wrote about the American South, [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]].&lt;ref name="Paris Review"&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury The Art of Fiction No. 203: Ray Bradbury], Interviewed by Sam Weller; ''The Paris Review'', Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was once described as a "[[Midwest]] [[surrealism|surrealist]]" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as "the art of the possible." Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:

{{quote|First of all, I don't write science fiction. I've only done one science fiction book and that's ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', based on reality. Science fiction is a depiction of the real. Fantasy is a depiction of the unreal. So ''[[Martian Chronicles]]'' is not science fiction, it's fantasy. It couldn't happen, you see? That's the reason it's going to be around a long time -- because it's a [[Greek myth]], and myths have staying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wil Gerken |author2=Nathan Hendler |author3=Doug Floyd |author4=John Banks |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/09-27-99/alibi_feat1.html |title=Books: Grandfather Time (Weekly Alibi . 09-27-99) |publisher=Weeklywire.com |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmolearning.com/videos/a-conversation-with-ray-bradbury-2001-1131/ A Conversation with Ray Bradbury] Point Loma Nazarene University, Writer's Symposium By The Sea; "The only science fiction I have written is ''Fahrenheit 451''.

I am a fantasy writer. But the label got put on me and stuck." March 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, "From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who’ve said things well." He is quoted, "If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/06/personal_lessons_from_futurist.html Personal lessons from futurist Ray Bradbury on crying, escaping, laughing], by Mick Mortlock; Oregon Live, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceagecity.com/bradbury/bio.htm Ray Bradbury Biography] Ray Bradbury Online&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing,&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton, and Molly Weigel, eds. American Writers (Supp. 4, Pt. 1). New York: Macmillian Library Reference. 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:
{{quote| Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2009-06-19"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-1988oct01&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-01/local/me-4256_1_central-library "Mayor, Author Launch Library Funding Drive"]. [[Los Angeles Times]], October 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He told ''[[The Paris Review]]'', "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don’t."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury Interview] ''The Paris Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury described his inspiration as, "My stories run up and bite me in the leg -- I respond by writing them down -- everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off".&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Anu, A  Word a Day, 2017.08.22, wordsmith.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Green Town"===
A reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', and ''Farewell Summer'', as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Morning, Summer Night by Ray Bradbury|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|website=Subterranean Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822143044/http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|archivedate=August 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.&lt;ref&gt;Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where  his grandfather and he gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural contributions==
Bradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:
{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:
{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?&lt;br&gt;
R.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can’t say certain  things. The homosexual groups don’t want you to criticize them. It’s thought control and freedom of speech control.&lt;ref name="Conversations with Ray Bradbury"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasior |first1=Ann |title=Bradbury Talk Likely to Feature the Unexpected |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:168044/datastream/PDF/view |website=Florida State University Libraries |publisher=Dayton Daily News |accessdate=2 June 2018 |pages=104–105 |language=English |date=1 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1982 essay, he wrote, "People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/10/19/prevent-the-future/ |title=I Do Not Want to Predict the Future. I Want to Prevent It| publisher=Quote Investigator |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sometimes attributed it to him.

On May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' hosted by [[Groucho Marx]].  During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", his short story published six years earlier in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' under the title "The World the Children Made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBTrUx46b8I|title=You Bet Your Life #55-35 Science fiction author Ray Bradbury (Secret word 'House', May 24, 1956)|date=November 16, 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nywf64.com/unista09.shtml|title=The American Journey|first=Ray |last=Bradbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the original exhibit housed in [[Epcot]]'s [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]] geosphere at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]].&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bradbury|title=In 1982 he created the interior metaphors for the Spaceship Earth display at Epcot Center, Disney World|url= http://www.raybradbury.com/bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_town_talk.html|author=Ray Bradbury|title=The images at Spaceship Earth in DisneyWorld's EPCOT Center in Orlando?

"He also serves as a consultant, having collaborated, for example, in the design of a pavilion in the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World." Referring to Spaceship Earth&amp;nbsp;... [http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_book_mag.html raybradbury.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton., and Molly V. Weigel. American Writers: a Collection of Literary Biographies. New York: Scribner, 1996. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he also hosted ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', a televised [[anthology series]] based on his short stories.

Bradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said "libraries raised me", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2012|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, "I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.' I hate people like that – I call them the neo-[[Luddites]]", and "In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too".&lt;ref name="lemley19850108"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwjS--W2mG8C&amp;pg=PA133 | title=Other Voices, Other Futures | work=PC Magazine | date=January 8, 1985 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=Lemley, Brad | page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resisted the conversion of his work into [[e-book]]s, saying in 2010, "We have too many cellphones. We've got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15968500|title=Fahrenheit 451 becomes e-book despite author's feelings|publisher=BBC News |date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the publishing rights for ''Fahrenheit 451'' came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon &amp; Schuster catalog where this is possible.&lt;ref name="time obit"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| title='Fahrenheit 451' Author Ray Bradbury Dies at 91| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Robert|last=Jablon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233645/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| archivedate=June 8, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were [[EC Comics]]' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Weird Science'', ''Weird Fantasy'', ''Crime Suspenstories'', and ''Haunt of Fear''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-ray-bradbury-theater-20120606,0,3881510.story Ray Bradbury, 91, leaves a rich theatrical legacy too] by David Ng; Los Angeles Times, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s-1960s era: [[Jason V Brock]]'s ''Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man'',&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/03/richard-matheson-remembers-his-good-friend-charles-beaumont/ "Richard Matheson remembers his good friend Charles Beaumont"], March 24, 2010.

Bradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore [[Fahrenheit 451 Books]] in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, [[Joseph Mugnaini]], in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Riegert, ''Hidden Coast of California: The Adventurer's Guide'' (Berkeley, Cal.: Ulysses Press, 1988), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury in December 2009]]
Bradbury was married to Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922&amp;nbsp;– November 24, 2003) from 1947 until her death; they had four daughters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9315001/Ray-Bradbury.html |title=Telegraph obituary |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan, Ramona, Bettina, and Alexandra.&lt;ref name="BBC dies"/&gt; Bradbury never obtained a [[driver's license]], but relied on public transportation or his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle |first=Warren |url=http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |title=Sci-Fi Author Ray Bradbury Trashes the Web |publisher=Switched |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001142931/http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at home until he was 27 and married. His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

He was raised [[Baptist]] by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a "delicatessen religionist" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was "a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/08/02/Bradbury/index.html| title=Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels'| publisher=CNN| date=August 2, 2010| accessdate=October 14, 2015| first=John| last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a close friend of [[Charles Addams]], and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own [[Addams Family]] placed in rural [[Illinois]]. Bradbury's first story about them was "Homecoming", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray Interview with Ray Bradbury] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203203807/http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray |date=February 3, 2009 }} in ''IndieBound'', fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'', featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original "Homecoming" illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray, ''From The Dust Returned: A Novel''.

Another close friend was animator [[Ray Harryhausen]], who was [[best man]] at Bradbury's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitaker |first=Sheila |title=Ray Harryhausen obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/07/ray-harryhausen-dies |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[BAFTA]] 2010 awards tribute in honor of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman's house when they were both 18 years old. Their shared love for science fiction, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', and the [[King Vidor]]-directed film ''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]'', written by [[Ayn Rand]], was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices. After their first meeting, they kept in touch at least once a month, in a friendship that spanned over 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BAFTA Online|title=Ray Bradbury pays Tribute to Ray Harryhausen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv3KiAVUOhE&amp;t=2m48s|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the "devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends." Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for ''Star Trek'', which Bradbury never did, objecting that he "never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

Bradbury suffered a stroke in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/sci-fi_great_ray_bradbury_suffers_stroke/38990|title=Sci-Fi Great Ray Bradbury Suffers Stroke|publisher=[[E!]]|date=November 12, 1999|accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Joal|last=Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; that left him partially dependent on a wheelchair for mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/18/print/main324869.shtml|title=Ray Bradbury Still Writing At 81|first=Jim|last=Rogers|date=January 18, 2002|accessdate=June 6, 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he continued to write, and had even written an essay for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', about his inspiration for writing, published only a week prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/04/120604fa_fact_bradbury|title=Take Me Home|first=Ray|last=Bradbury|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury made regular appearances at science-fiction conventions until 2009, when he retired from the circuit.

''The New York Times'' called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream."&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' credited Bradbury with the ability "to write lyrically and evocatively of lands an imagination away, worlds he anchored in the here and now with a sense of visual clarity and small-town familiarity".&lt;ref name="latimes obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ray Bradbury dies at 91; author lifted fantasy to literary heights |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 6, 2012| accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Lynell|last=George|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/06/local/la-me-ray-bradbury-20120607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury's grandson, Danny Karapetian, said Bradbury's works had "influenced so many artists, writers, teachers, scientists, and it's always really touching and comforting to hear their stories".&lt;ref name="BBC dies"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18345350|title=Author Ray Bradbury dies, aged 91 |publisher=BBC News|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted several modern day technologies that Bradbury had envisioned much earlier in his writing, such as the idea of [[automatic teller machine|banking ATMs]] and [[headphones|earbuds and Bluetooth headsets]] from ''Fahrenheit 451'', and the concepts of [[artificial intelligence]] within ''[[I Sing the Body Electric (Bradbury)|I Sing the Body Electric]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/dreams-of-ray-bradbury-ten-predictions-that-came-true/2012/06/06/gJQAqbs9IV_story.html|title=Dreams of Ray Bradbury: 10 predictions that came true|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Hayley|last=Tsukayama }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2012, in an official public statement from the [[White House Press Office]], President [[Barack Obama]] said:

==Bibliography==
[[File:Planet stories 195311.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury's "The Golden Apples of the Sun" was published in the November 1953 issue of ''[[Planet Stories]]''.]]
{{Main|Ray Bradbury bibliography|Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography}}
Bradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories.&lt;ref name="latimes obit"/&gt; More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"/&gt;

===First novel===
In 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, "You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''." Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''&lt;ref name="Paris Review"/&gt;

===Intended first novel===
What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations to other media==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]
From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including "Kaleidoscope" and "Rocket Man" being combined as "Home To Stay" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of "The Handler" under the title "A Strange Undertaking") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].
Also in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. "The Merry-Go-Round", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's "The Black Ferris", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.

[[File:Rhedosaurus &amp; the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's ''[[The Fog Horn]]'']]

Producer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment "Atomic Monster". Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's "[[The Fog Horn]]", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, "Tyrannosaurus Rex", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.
Bradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.

Bradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.

In 1965, three of Bradbury's stories were adapted for the stage. These included "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit", "The Day It Rained Forever", and "Device Out of Time". The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''. The plays debuted at the Coronet Theater in Hollywood and featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]]. The director was Charles Rome Smith and the production company was Pandemonium Productions.

[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[François Truffaut]].

In 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, "Planes That Land on Grass".

In 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

''[[The Martian Chronicles (TV miniseries)|The Martian Chronicles]]'' became a three-part TV [[miniseries]] starring [[Rock Hudson]], which was first broadcast by [[NBC]] in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries "just boring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York| publisher=HarperCollins| year=2005| pages=301–302| isbn=0-06-054581-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 television movie ''[[The Electric Grandmother]]'' was based on Bradbury's short story "I Sing the Body Electric".

The 1983 horror film ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', starring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]], is based on the Bradbury novel of the [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|same name]].

In 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced "[[Bradbury 13]]", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of "The Ravine", "Night Call, Collect", "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", "There Was an Old Woman", "Kaleidoscope", "[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]", "The Screaming Woman", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "The Man", "The Wind", "The Fox and the Forest", "[[Here There Be Tygers]]", and "The Happiness Machine". Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.

From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.

Deeply respected in the [[USSR]], Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science-fiction TV series ''This Fantastic World'' which adapted the stories film version of "I Sing The Body Electric", ''Fahrenheit 451'', "A Piece of Wood", "To the Chicago Abyss", and "Forever and the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtrf.ru/|title=State fund of Television and Radio Programs|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of [[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]] («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] director Nazim Tyuhladziev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|script-title=ru:Будет ласковый дождь|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909130617/http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|archivedate=September 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a film adaptation of [[The Veldt (film)|''The Veldt'' in 1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raybradbury.ru/video-stage/video/the_veldt/|script-title=ru:"Вельд", Киностудия "Узбекфильм", 1987|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of "[[Here There Be Tygers]]" («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Мультипликационные фильмы|url=http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1&amp;letter=%c7|website=Творческое объединение «Экран»|accessdate=14 August 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of ''[[The Halloween Tree (1993 TV film)|The Halloween Tree]]'', based on [[The Halloween Tree|his 1972 novel]].

The 1998 film ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story "The Magic White Suit" originally published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.

In 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of ''Fahrenheit 451'' at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050827043730/http://sromagazine.biz/mag/one_hot_stage/index.html Pixel Pups].

In 2005, the film ''[[A Sound of Thunder (film)|A Sound of Thunder]]'' was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'' revolves around the same theory as ''A Sound of Thunder'' and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of ''A Piece of Wood'' and ''[[The Small Assassin]]'' were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] for using the title ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which is an allusion to Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', for his documentary about the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated,  though Bradbury was [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative-leaning]] politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/301992/ray-bradbury-great-conservative-john-fund|title=Ray Bradbury, a Great Conservative|publisher=Nationalreview.com|date=June 6, 2012|author=Fund, John|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|pages=330–331|isbn=0-06-054581-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the film ''[[Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis]]'' was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.

In 2010, ''The Martian Chronicles'' was adapted for radio by ''Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air''.

Bradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in [[Terry Sanders]]' film ''Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer'' (1963).

Bradbury's poem "Groon" was voiced as a tribute in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/49873749|title="Groon" (a poem) by Ray Bradbury|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36797">'''Representation''' is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; It is through representation that people organize the world and reality through the act of naming its elements.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; Signs are arranged in order to form [[semantics|semantic]] constructions and express relations.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; 
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of [[Aristotle]], Greek philosopher]]
For many philosophers, both ancient and modern, man is regarded as the "representational animal" or ''[[animal symbolicum]]'', the creature whose distinct character is the creation and the manipulation of signs – things that "stand for" or "take the place of" something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;

Representation has been associated with [[aesthetics]] (art) and [[semiotics]] (signs). Mitchell says "representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to [[Ulysses (novel)|a novel]] representing the day in the life of several Dubliners".&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 13--&gt;
 
The term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]], 'representation' is commonly defined in three ways. 
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time; to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies.&lt;ref name=Stadler2005/&gt;

==Defining representation==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|''Reproduction of the [[Mona Lisa]]'']]
To represent is "to bring to mind by description," also "to symbolize, to be the embodiment of;" from O.Fr. representer (12c.), from L. repraesentare, from re-, intensive prefix, + praesentare "to present," lit. "to place before".

A representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is described in a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. The degree to which an artistic representation ''resembles'' the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the [[Mona Lisa]] and a child's crayon drawing of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.

==History==
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Greek theatrical masks depicted in [[Hadrian]]s Villa mosaic'']]
Since ancient times representation has played a central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation.&lt;ref name=Childers1995&gt;Childers J (ed.), ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002&gt;&lt;Vukcevich, M 2002, "Representation", The University of Chicago, viewed 7 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990&gt;Mitchell, W, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and being in the world.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002/&gt; Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the [[The Real|"real things"]].&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.), ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.  {{ISBN|978-0761954323}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from "real things". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Aristotle went on to say it was a definitively human activity.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;
From childhood man has an instinct for representation, and in this respect man differs from the other animals that he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons though imitating things.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;
Aristotle discusses representation in three ways—
#'''The object:''' The symbol being represented.
#'''Manner:''' The way the symbol is represented.
#'''Means:''' The material that is used to represent it.
The '''means''' of literary representation is [[language]]. An important part of representation is the relationship between what the material and what it represents. The questions arising from this are, "A stone may represent a man but how? And by what and by what agreement, does this understanding of the representation occur?"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;

One apprehends reality only through representations of reality, through texts, discourses, images: there is no such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality. But because one can see reality only through representation it does not follow that one does not see reality at all… Reality is always more extensive and complicated than any system of representation can comprehend, and we always sense that this is so-representation never "gets" reality, which is why human history has produced so many and changing ways of trying to get it.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993&gt;Dryer 1993, cited in O’Shaughnessy &amp; Stadler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 3--&gt;

Consequently, throughout the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people only know reality through representation.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993/&gt; From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.

==Contemporary ideas about representation==
It is from Plato’s caution that in the modern era many are aware of political and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In [[motion picture rating system]]s, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on a life of their own once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Consequently, for each of the above definitions there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function in the context of a body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

For instance objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as something larger than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, "…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1994&gt;Mitchell, W, ''Picture Theory'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p188--&gt; and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely "objects representing", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.

==Peirce and representation==
[[Image:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) was an innovative and accomplished logician, mathematician, and scientist, and founded [[pragmatism|philosophical pragmatism]]. Peirce's central ideas were focused on [[logic]] and representation.

===Semiotics and logic===
Peirce distinguished philosophical logic as logic ''per se'' from mathematics of logic. He regarded logic (''per se'') as part of philosophy, as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), CP 1.180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' 2:372–3. For the relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" at ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]'', Bergman and Paavola, editors, U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', vol. 2, no. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book Search'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:214–214; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 4:378–382.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, more generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–615, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–668, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 3:276–290, and ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:142–154. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce held that logic is formal semiotic,&lt;ref name=L75&gt;Peirce, C. S. (written 1902), "MS L75: Logic, Regarded As Semeiotic (The Carnegie application of 1902): Version 1: An Integrated Reconstruction", Joseph Ransdell, ed., ''Arisbe'', see [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Memoir 12].&lt;/ref&gt; the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or ''quasi-mind'' (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one);&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-Mind]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, eds., University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus here is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).

He argued that, since all thought takes time, "all thought is in signs"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted (''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraphs 213–263, the quote is from paragraph 253).&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("[[semiosis]]") and that the three irreducible elements of semiosis are (1) the ''sign'' (or [[wiktionary:representamen|representamen]]), (2) the (semiotic) ''object'', the sign's subject matter, which the sign represents and which can be anything thinkable&amp;mdash;quality, brute fact, or law&amp;mdash;and even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet]]), and (3) the ''interpretant'' (or interpretant sign), which is the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect that is a further sign, for example, a translation.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of semiosis, sign, representamen, object, interpretant, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign because it is at least potentially interpretable. A sign depends on its object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) interpretation, forming an interpretant which, in turn, depends on the sign and on the object ''as the sign depends on the object'' and is thus a further sign, enabling and determining still further interpretation, further interpretants. That essentially triadic process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is what defines sign, object, and interpretant.

An object either (1) is ''immediate'' to a sign, and that is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a ''dynamic'' object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's [[universe of discourse]], the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) ''immediate'' to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) ''dyanamic'', an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) ''final'' or ''normal'', a question's true settlement, which ''would'' be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce said that, in order to know to what a sign refers, the mind needs some sort of experience of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Professor Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Also see pp. 404–409 in "Pragmatism" by Peirce in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a ''[[roman à clef]]'', counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.

Peirce held that logic has three main parts:
# '''Speculative grammar''',&lt;ref name=spec&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/grammarspec.html Grammar: Speculative]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on meaningfulness, conditions for meaning. Study of significatory elements and combinations.
# '''Logical critic''',&lt;ref name=critic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/critic.html Critic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various distinct modes.
# '''Speculative rhetoric''', or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=methodeutic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/methodeutic.html Methodeutic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

1. '''Speculative Grammar'''. By this, Peirce means discovering relations among questions of how signs can be meaningful and of what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others. Within this broad area, Peirce developed three interlocked universal [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomies]] of signs, depending respectively on (1) the sign itself, (2) how the sign stands for its object, and (3) how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Each trichotomy is divided according to the phenomenological category involved: ''Firstness'' (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), ''secondness'' (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or ''thirdness'' (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/categories.html Categories, Cenopythagorean Categories]", ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#I. Qualisign.2C sinsign.2C legisign|Qualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns]]. Every sign is either (qualisign) a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon.2C index.2C symbol|Icons, indices, and symbols]]. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments]]. Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}} 
Some (not all) sign classes from different trichotomies intersect each other. For example, a qualisign is always an icon, and is never an index or a symbol. He held that there were only ten classes of signs logically definable through those three universal trichotomies.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 254–263, reprinted in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115]–118, and in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that there were further such universal trichotomies as well. Also, some signs need other signs in order to be embodied. For example, a legisign (also called a type), such as the word "the," needs to be embodied in a sinsign (also called a token), for example an individual instance of the word "the", in order to be expressed. Another form of combination is attachment or incorporation: an index may be attached to, or incorporated by, an icon or a symbol.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations.

2. '''Logical critic''' or Logic Proper. That is how Peirce refers to logic in the everyday sense. Its main objective, for Peirce, is to classify arguments and determine the validity and force of each kind.&lt;ref name=critic/&gt; He sees [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|three main modes]]: [[Abductive reasoning|abductive inference]] (guessing, inference to a hypothetical explanation); [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. A work of art may embody an inference process and be an argument without being an explicit argumentation. That is the difference, for example, between most of ''[[War and Peace]]'' and its final section.

3. '''Speculative rhetoric''' or methodeutic. For Peirce this is the theory of effective use of signs in investigations, expositions, and applications of truth. Here Peirce coincides with Morris’s notion of pragmatics, in his interpretation of this term. He also called it "methodeutic", in that it is the analysis of the methods used in inquiry.&lt;ref name=methodeutic/&gt;

===Using signs and objects===
Peirce concluded that there are three ways in which signs represent objects. They underlie his most widely known trichotomy of signs:
* Icon
* Index
* Symbol&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of icon, index, symbol, and related terms, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Icon
This term refers to signs that represent by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though they can also be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.

;Index
Peirce explains that an index is a sign that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, if we see smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word "this" to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word "this" is like the pointing of a finger.

;Symbol
Peirce treats symbols as habits or norms of reference and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs on how they ''will'' be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as "horse" and ''&lt;span lang=es&gt;caballo&lt;/span&gt;'', which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word "horse" on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt; Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.

For example, we can call a large metal object with four wheels, four doors, an engine and seats a "car" because such a term is agreed upon within our culture and it allows us to communicate.  In much the same way, as a society with a common set of understandings regarding language and signs, we can also write the word "car" and in the context of Australia and other English speaking nations, know what it symbolises and is trying to represent.&lt;ref name=Dupriez1991&gt;Dupriez, B, ''A Dictionary of Literary Devices'', University of Toronto Press, Canada, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saussure and representation==
[[Image:Ferdinand de Saussure by Jullien.png|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]
Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) played a major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Culler1976&gt;Culler, J 1976, ''Saussure'', Fontana Modern Masters, Britain, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies.&lt;ref name=Ryder2004&gt;Ryder, M, ''Semiotics: Language and Culture'', 2004 viewed 6 April 2006 see link below&lt;/ref&gt; Although semiotics is often used in the form of [[textual analysis]] it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.

The process of representation is characterised by using signs that we recall mentally or phonetically to comprehend the world.&lt;ref name=Klarer1998&gt;Klarer, M, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'', Routledge, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure says before a human can use the word "tree" she or he has to envision the mental concept of a tree.

Two things are fundamental to the study of signs:&lt;ref name=Barry2002&gt;Barry, P, ''Beginning Theory: an Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', Manchester University Press, Great Britain, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The '''signified:''' a mental concept, and
#The '''signifier:''' the verbal manifestation, the sequence of letters or sounds, the linguistic realisation.
The signifier is the word or sound; the signified is the representation.
 
Saussure points out that signs:
*Are '''arbitrary:''' There is no link between the signifier and the signified
*Are '''relational:''' We understand we take on meaning in relation to other words. Such as we understand "up" in relation to "down" or a dog in relation to other animals, such as a cat.
*'''constitute our world''' – "You cannot get outside of language. We exist inside a system of signs".&lt;ref name=Barry2002/&gt;

Saussure suggests that the meaning of a sign is arbitrary, in effect; there is no link between the signifier and the signified.&lt;ref name=Holdcroft1991&gt;Holdcroft 1991 no details&lt;/ref&gt; The signifier is the word or the sound of the word and the signified is the representation of the word or sound. For example, when referring to the term "sister" (signifier) a person from an English speaking country such as Australia, may associate that term as representing someone in their family who is female and born to the same parents (signified). An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australian]] may associate the term "sister" to represent a close friend that they have a bond with. This means that the representation of a signifier depends completely upon a person’s cultural, linguistic and social background. Saussure argues that if words or sounds were simply labels for existing things in the world, translation from one language or culture to another would be easy, it is the fact that this can be extremely difficult that suggests that words trigger a representation of an object or thought depending on the person that is representing the signifier.&lt;ref name=Chandler2001&gt;Chandler, D, ''Semiotics for Beginners: Modality and representation'', viewed 8 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The signified triggered from the representation of a signifier in one particular language do not necessarily represent the same signified in another language. Even within one particular language many words refer to the same thing but represent different people's interpretations of it. A person may refer to a particular place as their "work" whereas someone else represents the same signifier as their "favorite restaurant".  This can also be subject to historical changes in both the signifier and the way objects are signified.

Saussure claims that an imperative function of all written languages and alphabetic systems is to "represent" spoken language.&lt;ref name=Arnason2006&gt;Arnason, D, Reference material, 2006, viewed 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most languages do not have writing systems that represent the [[Phoneme|phonemic sounds]] they make. For example, in English the written letter "a" represents different phonetic sounds depending on which word it is written in. The letter "a" has a different sound in the word in each of the following words, "apple", "gate", "margarine" and "beat", therefore, how is a person unaware of the phonemic sounds, able to pronounce the word properly by simply looking at alphabetic spelling. The way the word is represented on paper is not always the way the word would be represented phonetically. This leads to common misrepresentations of the phonemic sounds of speech and suggests that the [[writing system]] does not properly represent the true nature of the pronunciation of words.

The '''Santo Tomás de las Ollas''' hermitage is situated in the town with the same name close to [[Ponferrada]], [[León, Spain|León]] ([[Spain]]).

==History==
[[Image:STdlO interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Double horseshoe arch which separates the principal chapel from the nave.]]

The name of the hermitage, taken from the town Santo Tomás de las Ollas (St. Thomas of the [[Ollas]]), comes from the main occupation of that locality: pottery. They supplied to the [[Valle del Silencio]] zone.

The hermitage was donated to the community of [[San Pedro de Montes]] monastery by the [[Bishop of Astorga]].

==High-profile negotiations==
Over the course of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has represented hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to achieve because it then provides an "umbrella" from which other players can benefit.&lt;ref name=Rookie/&gt; Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking "hometown discount" contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1992, Boras negotiated a record five-year, $28 million contract for [[Greg Maddux]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]], eclipsing the second-best offer by $9 million. The contract trailed only [[David Cone]]'s contract in terms of annual value and was two years longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1993, Boras represented the first two picks in the draft, [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[Darren Dreifort]]. Both eventually received $1.3 million contracts,&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; although Rodriguez signed against Boras's advice. Boras was demanding a $3 million deal, and nearly prevented Rodriguez from signing at all.
* In 1996, Boras used an obscure provision in the major league rules to have draft picks [[Matt White (minor league pitcher)|Matt White]] (seventh overall pick, [[San Francisco Giants]]) and [[Bobby Seay]] (12th overall pick, [[Chicago White Sox]]) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than what they would have received via the draft process. The following year, [[Major League Baseball]] changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; For many years, being "outsmarted" by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], one of Commissioner [[Bud Selig]]'s closest allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1997, Boras advised draft pick [[J. D. Drew]] not to accept the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' $3 million offer. Drew instead signed a professional contract with the independent [[St. Paul Saints]]. Boras and the [[MLBPA]] then filed a grievance to have Drew declared a free agent since only "amateurs" could be subject to what was then known as the "amateur draft". Boras won the argument, but the arbitrator ruled he could not grant Drew free agency since he was not a member of the MLBPA. Instead, Drew re-entered the draft the following year and signed with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for nearly three times the Phillies' best offer.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; [[Major League Baseball]] again was forced to amend its rules because of Boras; the draft is now called the "First Year Player Draft" as a result of the Drew grievance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/|title=First-Year Player Draft|website=Major League Baseball|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the 1997 season, Boras broke the $50 million barrier by negotiating a five-year, $57.5 million contract for [[Greg Maddux]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]], making Maddux the highest paid player in the game.&lt;ref name=Maddux/&gt;
* Only a year later, in 1998, Boras broke the $100 million barrier by negotiating a seven-year, $105 million contract for [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]] with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Brown dethroned Maddux as the highest-paid player in the game.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;
* Also in 1998, Boras negotiated a seven-year, $87.5 million contract for [[Bernie Williams]] to stay with the [[New York Yankees]], even though the Yankees had made a public statement that they would not exceed $60 million for Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 1999, Boras filed a grievance on behalf of [[Adrián Beltré]] because the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] falsified Beltré's [[Dominican Republic]] birth records prior to signing him in 1994. Team representatives changed the records in order to sign Beltré when he was only 15 (under baseball rules international prospects are not eligible to sign until they are 16). In response to Boras's grievance, Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] awarded Beltré damages of $48,500. Additionally, Selig imposed significant penalties on the Dodgers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In 2000, under Boras's supervision, high school prospect [[Landon Powell]] earned his GED following his junior year of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not expect him to be draft eligible, making him a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* At the baseball Winter Meetings following the 2000 season, Boras negotiated two record-breaking contracts for clients who had gone first and second overall in the 1993 draft. The former second pick, [[Darren Dreifort]], was the first to sign, with Boras finalizing a five-year, $55 million contract for Dreifort to stay with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] on December 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2003===
* In December 2003, Boras was a part of the complex multi-party negotiations that would have resulted in [[Alex Rodriguez]] being traded from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Boras and Rodriguez offered to accept $12 million in reduced salaries in return for marketing rights and the right for Rodriguez to be a free agent after the 2005 season. The trade was eventually killed by the [[MLBPA]] because it would have cost Rodriguez $30 million in previously guaranteed compensation, setting a bad precedent (from the union's perspective) regarding the renegotiation of guaranteed contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Serbia Fashion Week''' is a fashion show held twice a year in [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2017/09/02/news/danube-city-novi-sad-is-the-jewel-in-serbia-s-crown-1123565/|title=Danube city Novi Sad is the jewel in Serbia's crown|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring in April and November, the event attracts local and international fashion designers, such as [[Thierry Mugler]] and [[Anna Fendi]].  In addition to runway shows, seminars and exhibits, the "Fashion Talent Design Competition" helps promote young Serbian designers by showcasing their collections.

==About==
Partially sponsored by the municipal government, Serbia Fashion Week was founded in 2013 by current head Svetlana Horvat. Having worked as a womenswear designer, she is also the current president of the National Serbian Chamber of Fashion.&lt;ref name="topsrbija.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topsrbija.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6533:svetlana-horvat-najavila-spektakularnu-nacionalnu-nedelju-mode-&amp;catid=320:manastiri&amp;Itemid=563|title=Svetlana Horvat najavila spektakularnu Nacionalnu nedelju mode|website=www.topsrbija.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rtv.rs/sr_ci/vojvodina/novi-sad/serbia-fashion-week-od-24.-do-29.-aprila-na-pet-lokacija-u-ns_911596.html|title="Serbia fashion week" од 24. до 29. априла на пет локација у НС|first=Јавна медијска установа ЈМУ Радио-телевизија|last=Војводине|website=ЈМУ Радио-телевизија Војводине}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novisad.rs/otvara-e-prvog-serbia-fashion-week|title=ОТВАРАЊЕ ПРВОГ „SERBIA FASHION WEEK“ - Novi Sad|website=www.novisad.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">A '''short-title catalogue''' (or catalog) is a [[bibliography|bibliographical]] resource that lists printed items in an abbreviated fashion, recording the most important words of their titles. The term is commonly encountered in the context of [[early modern period|early modern]] books, which frequently have lengthy, descriptive titles on their [[title page]]s. Many short-title catalogues are [[union catalogue]]s, listing items in the custody of multiple libraries.

Online short-title catalogues in fact tend to record complete (and therefore longer) title [[transcription (linguistics)|transcriptions]].

The '''Sintra Collar''' is a Bronze Age gold neck-ring found near [[Sintra]] in [[Portugal]]. Since 1900, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection and has long been admired for the sophistication and geometric beauty of its design and technique.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1363132&amp;partId=1&amp;people=26619&amp;peoA=26619-3-17&amp;page=1], British Museum, retrieved 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The Sintra Collar is made of three thick round bars of graduated [[diameters]] which have been tapered and fused together at the ends. A ribbed link-plate is loosely attached by means of hooks at the end which pass through [[perforation]]s. The front segments of the bars carry incised [[geometric]] decoration of parallel lines, divided into panels and fringed by a series of [[triangles]] (known as dog's tooth design). Attached at either end are two separately formed cups of [[gold]], with an internal spike and moulding. The catch-plate is ornamented with five ribs, three of which have incised oblique lines.

==Discovery==
The gold [[Collar (jewelry)|collar]] was allegedly found in 1878 by workers digging a ditch in a stone [[quarry]] in the Casal Amaro parish of Santa Maria, near Sintra in [[Portugal]]. According to reports at the time, the neck-ring was found with human bones in a grave. Soon after its discovery, the finds were purchased by the landowner. It was later bought by the [[London]] dealers John Hall Junior &amp; Co, who sold it to the British Museum at the [[turn of the century]].

==Importance==
The Sintra Collar is one of a number of similar [[bronze-age]] jewellery finds recorded along the [[Atlantic]] seaboard of Europe. Its decoration, for example, is paralleled in contemporary [[torc]]s found in southern [[Spain]] at sites such as Sagrajas near [[Badajoz]]. However, its complex design of tapering bars and catch-plate with accompanying hooks is unique.

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T. R. J.| last2 = Pariante | first2 = C.| last3 = McLoughlin | first3 = D.| pmc = 3027955 | pmid=21686859}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not listed as a recognised condition in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stick licensing''' is the practice of licensing a [[patent]] or other form of intellectual property where the patent holder threatens to sue the licensee for [[patent infringement]] if the licensee does not take a license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iplcllc.com/docs/Article-OutsideHelp.pdf Charles R. Neuenschwander, "Licensing Patents in Unfriendly Waters: The Use of Outside Help in Assertive Programs", The Licensing Journal, February 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the stick licensing, the "carrot licensing" is a "friendly approach in luring the target to adopting one's invention and taking a license".&lt;ref&gt; Matthew Y Ma, "Fundamentals of patenting and licensing for scientists and engineers", World Scientific, 2009, {{ISBN|981-283-420-6}}, {{ISBN|978-981-283-420-1}}, p 188. &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 7''' by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] was composed in 2000. It was written for and dedicated to the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]], by whom it was premiered on 19 June 2000 at the [[St Magnus Festival]], in the Pickaquoy Centre, [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]], conducted by the composer.

==Character and materials==
Davies regards this symphony as part of a seven-member [[Cycle (music)|cycle]], but not as its conclusion. Instead of ending, the Seventh Symphony forms a harmonic link to the opening of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Davies)|First Symphony]] {{harv|Service|2000}}. The composer describes the Seventh as his "most classical" symphony, with particular dependence on the music of [[Joseph Haydn]] {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (second doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani (a tom-tom or [[Rototom|roto-tom]] may be substituted for the piccolo timp), five percussionists (playing glockenspiel, marimba, crotales, tubular bells, 2 wood blocks (small, medium), tambourine, bubbolo, side drum, 2 bass drums (small, very large), antique cymbals, small suspended Chinese cymbal, clashed cymbals, 2 suspended cymbals (small, large), tam-tam), harp, celesta, and strings.

==Analysis==
The symphony is in four movements:
# Exposition
# Minuet and Trio
# Slow Movement
# Development

The first movement behaves as the [[Exposition (music)|exposition section]] (only) of a [[Sonata form|symphonic movement]], contrasting two types of musical material, both from each other, and from bridging music with less well-defined characteristics {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.
 
The second movement, in the classical form of a [[minuet and trio]], was inspired by the [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|op. 20 String Quartets]] of Haydn, though the musical surface does not sound like the Haydn models ({{harvnb|Davies|[2000]}}; {{harvnb|Service|2000}}).

Although the composer points to the simple, two- and three-part string writing at the beginning of the third, slow movement, as representing the spirit and style of Haydn's middle period {{harvnb|Davies|[2000]}}, the following build-up and climax has been seen as owing a heavy debt to [[Gustav Mahler]] {{harv|Service|2000}}.

The last movement is not a finale, but rather is titled "Development". Its dominant characteristic is that of the traditional [[musical development|development section]] of a classical symphony: systematic [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] through a succession of tonalities while, at the same time, ideas from earlier in the symphony are fragmented, reassembled, and reworked {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}. After a dramatic accelerando, a quotation from the slow movement arrives, followed by an inconclusive ending that links to the opening of the First Symphony {{harv|Service|2000}}, "so that the whole cycle could start over again" {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}.

'''''The Broken Road''''' (2013) is a [[travel literature|travel book]] by British author [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]]. Published posthumously by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], the book, edited by [[Artemis Cooper]], narrates the final section of the author's journey on foot across Europe from the [[Hook of Holland]] to [[Constantinople]] in 1933/34.

The first book, ''[[A Time of Gifts]]'', narrates Leigh Fermor's journey as far as the [[Danube|Middle Danube]]. The second volume, ''[[Between the Woods and the Water]]'' (1986), begins with the author crossing the [[Mária Valéria bridge]] from Czechoslovakia into Hungary and ends when he reaches the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], where the Danube formed the boundary between the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and Romania. He never published the third volume, but in 2011 Leigh Fermor's publisher, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] announced that it would publish the final volume, drawing from his diary at the time and an early draft that he wrote in the 1960s, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/20/patrick-leigh-fermor-final-volume "Patrick Leigh Fermor's final volume will be published"] ''The Guardian'' 20 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently releasing it in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/The-Broken-Road-retracing-the-steps-of-a-wild-adventure/ "The Broken Road: retracing the steps of a wild adventure"] Adrian Bridge ''The Telegraph'' 12 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover design is by Ed Kluz; [[John Craxton]] who designed the other volumes, had died in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnmurraybeagle.tumblr.com/post/78859500529/the-story-of-a-cover-the-broken-road-by-patrick-leigh "The story of a cover: The Broken Road by Patrick Leigh Fermor"], The Beagle blog of John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The City of Beautiful Nonsense''''' was a best-selling novel written by [[Ernest Temple Thurston]]. It became the inspiration for two films (see below for details). It was originally published by [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1909,&lt;ref name="Books and Persons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|title=Books and Persons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aa29jG22CoMC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=September 19, 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-4510-0667-4|pages=290–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because the [[copyright]] has expired, the text of the book is now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Thurston1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Temple Thurston|title=The city of beautiful nonsense|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqbPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1915|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a "new and illustrated" edition, with illustrations by Emile Verpilleux, published a year later in 1910. It may fairly be described as a sentimental novel: Temple Thurston himself wrote that "To many, from the first page to the last, it had not the faintest conception of reality, and indeed has earned for me the classification of sentimentalist". This was in the Author's Note to the sequel, entitled ''The World of Wonderful Reality'', published a decade later in 1919. His obituary in ''The Times'' (20 March 1933) stated that "there were those who might suggest that sentimentalism was too evident in Temple Thurston's work".  As well as being a vehicle for Edwardian romanticism, the novel shares the Roman Catholic faith of its author with its main characters.  It is a tale of two cities: mainly Edwardian London – the sidelights on life in London for the shabby genteel are interesting – but also Venice.

==Films==
The first film based on the novel was ''[[The City of Beautiful Nonsense (1919 film)|The City of Beautiful Nonsense]]'', a [[silent movie]] released in 1919,&lt;ref name="Advance: (1920)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advance: (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXM0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA291|accessdate=September 17, 2012|year=1920|publisher=Congregational Publishing Society|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]], [[Chrissie White]] and [[Henry Vibart]]

The second film was a [[Sound film|talkie]], released in 1935 as ''[[City of Beautiful Nonsense (1935 film)|City of Beautiful Nonsense]]''. It starred [[Emlyn Williams]], [[Sophie Stewart]] and [[Eve Lister]]. Both were filmed and produced in the United Kingdom.

'''''The Destruction of the Children of Niobe''''' is a painting by [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], created in 1760. It depicts the Greek myth of the murder of [[Niobe]]'s daughters by the goddess [[Artemis]] and her sons by [[Apollo]]. The painting won acclaim for Wilson, who obtained many commissions from British landowners seeking classical portrayals of their estates.

In 1761, publisher [[John Boydell]] hired [[William Woollett]], the foremost engraver in England, to make a print of Wilson's ''Niobe''.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3120?docPos=1 Clayton].&lt;/ref&gt; Boydell wanted a spectacular print to demonstrate the capability of English engravers, and he paid Woollett approximately £100 for the Niobe engraving, a staggering amount compared to the usual rates. This single act of patronage raised engravers' fees throughout London.&lt;ref&gt;Bruntjen, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's painting of ''Niobe'' is currently in the collection of the [[Yale Center for British Art]].

'''''The Five Senses''''' is a set of [[Allegory|allegorical]] paintings created at [[Antwerp]] in 1617&amp;ndash;18 by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]], with Brueghel being responsible for the settings and Rubens for the figures. They are now in the [[Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]]. They are all painted in [[Oil painting|oils]] on wood panel, approximately {{convert|65|x|110|cm|ftin}} in dimensions.

The series constitutes one of the best known and most successful collaborations by Brueghel and Rubens, who were close friends.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90&gt;Ariane van Suchtelen, "8.

==Description==
Rubens painted the allegorical female figures, accompanied by a [[putto]] or a winged [[Cupid]] in ''Sight'', ''Hearing'', ''Smell'' and ''Touch'', by a [[satyr]] in ''Taste''. Brueghel created the sumptuous settings, which evoke the splendour of the court of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and his wife [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], governors of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], to which the two artists were attached.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90/&gt; (The eroticism of the figures' near-nudity has been related to ecstasy in luxury.&lt;ref name=web&gt;Emil Krén and Daniel Marx, [http://www.wga.hu/html_m/b/bruegel/jan_e/2/5sense1.html ''The Sense of Hearing''], Web Gallery, retrieved 11 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Thus, in ''Sight'' the female figure is contemplating a painting of Christ's restoring the sight of a blind man, in a [[cabinet of curiosities]] full of pictures, antique busts, ''objets d'art'', and scientific instruments. The figure in ''Hearing'' is playing the [[lute]] amongst a collection of musical instruments and clocks. In ''Smell'', she sits among flowers in a garden, with a perfume distillery visible on the left. In ''Taste'', seated at a table groaning with food fit for a banquet, she is eating an oyster and a satyr is filling her glass. In ''Touch'', she embraces a putto in a superbly equipped armoury where there are also medical instruments, pain being an aspect of touch.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, pp. 90, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false 94], 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the details relate to the theme: for example, in ''Sight'' the paintings which can be seen range through almost every genre, and include ''St Cecilia'', the patroness of eyesight, and the inclusion of both real and painted garlands of flowers alludes to the contemporary debate about the relative status of art and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=entire%20Antwerp%20school%20&amp;f=false p. 96].&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been suggested that Albert and Isabella commissioned the set, since many details refer to them: three of the paintings show their palaces in the background, and ''Sight'' depicts a double portrait of the couple and a portrait of Albert on horseback, as well as a double-headed Habsburg eagle on the chandelier.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hearing'', the music is a [[madrigal]] dedicated to the couple.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

==History==
[[Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg]], is the first known owner of the series of paintings; he presented them in 1634 to the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]], who had just become governor of the Spanish Netherlands following the deaths of Albert and Isabella. Ferdinand in turn offered them through the Duke of [[Medina de las Torres]] to his brother King [[Philip IV of Spain]], who hung them in the reading room at the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94/&gt; They were subsequently housed in other royal palaces in Madrid and became part of the founding collection of the Prado in 1819.&lt;ref name=PradoSight/&gt;

[[File:Konrad Witz - Fischzug Petri.jpeg|400px|thumb|''The Miraculous Draft of Fishes'', 1444. 132cm x 154cm, [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]], [[Geneva]].]]

'''''The Miraculous Draft of Fishes''''' is a 1444 [[oil]] on wood panel painting by the [[Swabia|Swabian]] artist [[Konrad Witz]], on view in the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Museum of Art and History]] (''Musée d'Art et d'Histoire'') in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Originally part of a now dismantled altarpiece known as '''''Peter's Altar Table''''', the panel depicts the [[Miraculous catch of fish|miraculous catch of 153 fish]] as reported in the [[Gospel of John]] and shows a scene of the disciples, who had been fishing at the edge of a lake, recognising the stranger who had called out to them from the shore as the resurrected Jesus. [[Saint Peter|Peter]] is shown wading toward Jesus to greet him. In this painting Witz takes the revolutionary step of moving the scene from the biblical [[Sea of Galilee]] to his local area, around [[Lake Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, Stuart. "Searching for the God of Grace". Pacific Pr Pub Assn, 2006. 164. IBN 0-8163-2152-3&lt;/ref&gt; With this move, Witz was able to base his rendering of the far landscape on his own observation of actual topographical features rather than rely on imaginative interpretation as earlier artists did. He further brought the landscape to the fore of his work; here the range is not simply a footnote seen through a window or detail visible beyond a crucifixion scene. The painting is renowned for its naturalistic representation of the [[Graian Alps]] and the snow-capped peaks of [[Mont Blanc]] and [[Le Môle]] seen in the distance. In this regard the work is the earliest known faithful portrayal of a landscape in European art history.

Detailed landscapes had already been portrayed by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandist painters]] such as [[Jan van Eyck]], and their characteristic attention to surface textures and rendering the depth of the receding landscape held strong influence over Witz. However these earlier works were neither based on actual geographical areas, or the careful observation evident in this work. In its innovation, the panel is analogous to [[Hans Bornemann]], at the time working in [[Lüneburg]], who also adapted and greatly advanced the Netherlandish method when he began to paint, for the first time, cityscapes that gave a true account of all of the visible features, and not just the most important buildings.&lt;ref name="b59"&gt;Borchert, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heiligentaler Altar Detail Lueneburg.jpeg|left|300px|thumb|[[Hans Bornemann]], Detail from the ''Heiligentaler Altar'', c 1445]]
The painting can be seen as close study of the optics of [[Mirror image|reflection]] and the manner in which the form and appearance of objects is distorted reflected on water's surface.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian. "The A to Z of Renaissance Art". Scarecrow Press, 2009. 461. {{ISBN|0-8108-6880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings and rocks to the right are reflected, as are the coloured clothes of the men hauling a net in the small boat. In the foreground the water is so transparent the bed of the lake can be seen, while at the far end of the lake the tone of the water surface dissolves into a silvery expanse. Only the figure of Christ standing at the edge of the shore does not cast a reflection, the implication being that the laws of nature do not apply to the divine.&lt;ref name="b58"&gt;Borchert, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Tuner''''' ({{lang-ru|Настройщик}}, ''Nastroyshchik'') is a 2004 [[Ukraine]]/[[Russia]] mix film of art house grotesque and a sting comedy. At the heart of [[Kira Muratova]]’s film is her characteristic and enduring love of predation—predation for its own sake. The film offers a complex assessment of the human subject, civilization, and the creative act. It premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 2004.

The stars of the film include famous Russian actors such as [[Alla Demidova]], [[Renata Litvinova]], [[Nina Ruslanova]], and [[Georgi Deliyev]]. Directed by [[Kira Muratova]], author of sixteen films over forty-two years, best known in the West for her political rehabilitation during the perestroika period and the un-shelving of her so-called provincial melodramas, ''Brief Encounters'' (Korotkie vstrechi, 1967/1987) and ''Long Farewells'' (Dolgie provody, 1971/1987).

==Plot summary==
A former nurse, Liuba, seeking marriage through newspaper personal ads, is bilked by a stranger whom she mistakes for her new date.  Liuba’s elderly, well-to-do girlfriend, Anna Sergeevna is defrauded in a different fashion: having placed a newspaper ad for a piano tuner, she is entrapped by Andrei, who is not only an excellent tuner and musician, but also a reasonably good petty thief and scam artist.  Andrei and his current lover, Lina, attempting to further secure the women’s trust by returning Liuba’s money, which had been scammed yet again by a second potential husband cum con-artist, place their own fake personal ad in a newspaper so as to locate the suspect.  Having returned Liuba’s stolen money, Andrei finally swindles both Liuba and Anna Sergeevna through an elaborate bank forgery scheme—in a word, a portrait of normal human nature à la Muratova.

'''Tracing paper''' is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} it then found many other uses. The original use for drawing and tracing was largely superseded by technologies which do not require diazo copying or manual copying (by tracing) of drawings.

The transparency of the paper is achieved by careful selection of the raw materials and the process used to create transparency. [[Cellulose fiber|Cellulose fibre]] forms the basis of the paper, usually from wood species but also from cotton fibre. Often, paper contains other filler materials to enhance opacity and print quality. For tracing or translucent paper, it is necessary to remove any material which obstructs the transmission of light.&lt;ref name="A1020"&gt;[http://www.paperonweb.com/A1020.htm How is paper made translucent (grease proof, tracing paper)?] PaperOnWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Tracing paper is paper made to have low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing light to pass through. It is named as such for its ability for an [[image]] to be [[Copying|traced]] onto it. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings which could be copied precisely using the [[diazo copy]] process;{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When tracing paper is placed onto a [[picture]], the picture is easily visible through the paper. Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the tracing paper. Pure [[cellulose]] [[fiber]] is [[translucent]], and it is the [[air]] trapped between fibers that makes paper [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and look white.&lt;ref name="A1020" /&gt; If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting [[Paper|sheet]] will be translucent.

Tracing paper is usually made from [[Sulfite process|sulfite]] [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] by reducing the [[fibre]]s to a state of fine [[subdivision (paper)|subdivision]] and [[Hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] them by very prolonged beating in water.

There are three main processes to manufacture this type of paper, as follows:-

# Through mechanical ‘refining’ of the cellulose fibre to create a fibre which is highly fibrillated and gelatinous, so that in forming the sheet of paper, virtually all air is excluded from the internal structure of the paper. This method produces a very translucent and even looking paper over a range of grammages from 42 to over 280 gsm.
# By making a ‘normal’ sheet of paper and then filling the spaces between the fibres with a material that has the same refractive index as the cellulose. This was a common process adopted in the USA. The product was frequently called Vellum, although this terminology can refer to a wider range of special papers. Due to the relatively high cost, this method of manufacture has largely disappeared.
# As with 2, by making a normal sheet of paper, which is followed by immersing uncut and unloaded paper of good [[Quality (business)|quality]] in [[sulfuric acid]] for a few [[second]]s. The [[acid]] converts some of the [[cellulose]] into [[amyloid]] form having a [[gelatinous]] and impermeable character. When the treated paper is thoroughly washed and dried, the resultant [[Product (business)|product]] is much [[Tensile strength|stronger]] than the original paper. Tracing paper is resistant to [[oil]], [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] and to a large extent impervious to [[water]] and [[gas]].

The [[sizing]] in production will determine whether it is for [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet]]/[[offset printing]].

Tracing paper may be uncoated or coated.{{explain|reason=With what is it coated?|date=December 2017}} Natural tracing paper for laser printing is usually uncoated.

The [[Harmonized System|HS]] code for tracing paper is 4806.30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs_nomenclature_older_edition/~/media/18FE685D7E8E429996FC0F92A5DDB1C2.ashx|title=Paper and paperboard; articles of paper pulp, of paper or of paperboard|website=wcoomd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracing paper can be recycled and also can be made from up to 30% recycled fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com/faqs |title= Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} Arjoqiggins Creative Papers |work= arjowiggins-tracingpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Wartime Law on Industrial Property''' (Kogyo Shoyuken Senji Ho) was a [[Japanese law|special law]] enacted by the Government of [[Japan]] in 1917, which declared that any patents owned by the nationals of countries in a state of war with Japan no longer had effect. The impact of this law was both immense and lasting, because a majority of drugs had been invented in [[Germany]] and this law meant that Japanese companies could produce them without worrying about [[patent infringement]].&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

[[Statistics]] show that the number of new drugs in 1914 was 658 of which 103, or 16 per cent were developed domestically. By 1928, the number increased 2.6 times to 1,705 and the proportion of domestic development increased to 46 per cent. Further, by 1936, the number of new drugs increased to 2,402 of which more than half, 57 per cent were developed domestically.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"/&gt;
