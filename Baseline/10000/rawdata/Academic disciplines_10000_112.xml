'''ADS-AC''' is an experimental [[open-source model|open source]] program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System, a proposed mechanism for [[Artificial consciousness|AC]].

==Theory==
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.

The '''ATP test''' is a process of rapidly measuring actively growing microorganisms through detection of [[adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP.

==Method==

ATP is a [[molecule]] found in and around living [[cell (biology)|cells]], and as such it gives a direct measure of biological concentration and health. ATP is quantified by measuring the light produced through its reaction with the naturally occurring [[firefly]] enzyme [[luciferase]] using a [[photometer|luminometer]]. The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of ATP present in the sample.  

'''ATP tests can be used to:''' 

* Control biological treatment reactors
* Guide [[biocide]] dosing programs
* Determine drinking water cleanliness
* Manage [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes
* Assess soil activity
* Determine corrosion / deposit process type
* Measure equipment or product sanitation

==1st generation testing ''vs''. 2nd generation testing==

1st generation ATP tests are derived from [[hygiene]] monitoring uses where samples are relatively free of interferences. 2nd Generation tests are specifically designed for water, [[wastewater]] and industrial applications where, for the most part, samples contain a variety of components that can interfere with the ATP assay.

==How ATP is measured==



Within a water sample containing microorganisms, there are two types of ATP:

* [[Intracellular]] ATP – ATP contained within living biological cells.
* [[Extracellular]] ATP – ATP located outside of biological cells that has been released from dead or stressed organisms.

Accurate measurement of these two types of ATP is critical to utilizing ATP-based measurements. Being able to accurately measure these different types of ATP offers the ability to assess biological health and activity, and subsequently control water and [[wastewater]] processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">'''Air sex''' is a performance activity invented in [[Japan]]; clothed men and women simulate [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with an invisible partner, often in an exaggerated manner, set to music, and in a competition before an audience. This is somewhat akin to playing [[air guitar]], explaining the name. The creator, ''J-Taro Sugisaku'', says that it was invented in [[Tokyo]] in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. 

A report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine ''Weekly Playboy'' in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site ''[[Mainichi Shimbun|Mainichi Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/09/20060921p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan's air sex world champion licks himself into shape]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mainichi Daily News, 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the air sex "world championship" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22Air+Sex+World+Championship%22 Air Sex World Championship], YouTube, uploaded 2 January 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a segment of the [[BBC Three]] documentary show ''[[Japanorama]]'' in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;
''Japanorama'', Series 3, Episode 2, BBC3, first aired 26 March 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as "inappropriate for some users".

These videos led to coverage in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Air_Sex Air Sex links], by Buzzfeed
&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Japanorama'' video was shown in May 2007 at the [[JACON|JACON 2007]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2FlHwu6EM Air Sex Contest Jacon '07]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves "Peer Pressure" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name "amp6". [[Fleshbot]] called these "The Best Air Sex Video of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;"Peer Pressure" performed their routine in Atlanta as part of the official Air Sex World Championships tour in June 2009.

Since August 2007, The [[Alamo Drafthouse]] has been holding bimonthly Air Sex competitions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009 The Alamo Drafthouse toured the country on the Air Sex World Championships tour crowning Air Sex Champions in 14 cities. Later that October the first ever world champion was crowned when Shanghai Slammer from Los Angeles out-performed every other city champion. The tour was hosted by comedian [[Chris Trew]]. In October 2010 the group will tour once more.  Photos are posted on the Alamo Drafthouse Flickr page.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Cancer immunology''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[biology]] that is concerned with understanding the role of the [[immune system]] in the progression and development of [[cancer]]; the most well known application is [[cancer immunotherapy]], which utilises the immune system as a treatment for cancer. Cancer [[immunosurveillance]] and [[immunoediting]] are based on protection against development of tumors in animal systems and (ii) identification of targets for immune recognition of human cancer.

==Definition==

&lt;!-- ''Some of this section should move to [[Immunoediting]]'' --&gt;

[[Immunoediting]] induces selection for certain tumour cells, which loose dominant tumour-specific antigens allowing the tumour to progress.

Thus Obeid ''et al.''&lt;ref name="ObeidEtAl"/&gt; propose that the way in which cancer cells die during chemotherapy is vital. [[Anthracyclin]]s produce a beneficial immunogenic environment. The researchers report that when killing cancer cells with this agent uptake and presentation by antigen presenting dendritic cells is encouraged, thus allowing a T-cell response which can shrink tumours. Therefore, activating tumour-killing T-cells is crucial for immunotherapy success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Storkus"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Storkus WJ, Falo LD | title = A 'good death' for tumor immunology | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | date = Jan 2007 | pmid = 17206130 | doi = 10.1038/nm0107-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, advanced cancer patients with immunosuppression have left researchers in a dilemma as to how to activate their T-cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">The '''Center for Tropical Forest Science''', or CTFS, is a consortium of forest researchers who pursue long-term research on tree populations using comparable census method. The work developed out of a study of 50 hectares of forest on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in Panama begun in 1981. All individual trees larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were measured, mapped, and identified, which included 300 different species. This census has been repeated every five years since, most recently in 2010.

A total of 30 research institutions have now carried out parallel censuses of large forest plots. There are four such large-scale census projects in [[Africa]], nine in [[Latin America]], and 25 in [[Asia]]. Moreover, the census program has been expanded to include temperate and subtropical forests in [[China]]. Approximately 4.5 million individual trees of 8500 species are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctfs.si.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientific research reports on tree species [[Biodiversity|diversity]], [[range (biology)|distribution]], [[life expectancy|life span]], and growth rates have been published based on these plots.

CTFS is directed out of the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] in [[Panama City]], Panama. Researchers and institutions in 14 other countries participate in the network.

The forest plots include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctfs.si.edu/plots/summary/ |title=Plots Summary |date= |work= |publisher= Center for Tropical Forest Science |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Development and the Environment''' ({{lang-no|Senter for utvikling og miljø}}, SUM) is a research institute which is part of the [[University of Oslo]]. Its focus areas are [[international development]] and [[environmental studies]].

==History==
The Centre for Development and the Environment was established in 1990, following the work with the report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' (the Brundtland Report), presented by the [[Brundtland Commission]] chaired by Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], and the increased focus on the environment and sustainable development.

In 2000, the Program for Research and Documentation for a Sustainable Society (ProSus), formerly called the Project for an Alternative Future (established 1984), was merged into the Centre for Development and the Environment. ProSus was established on the initiative of 17 organisations and was funded by parliament over the Norwegian state budget; it was part of the [[Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities]] from the early 1990s and became part of the University of Oslo in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2000/09/prosus-vaktbikkje-for-miljoeet.html ProSus - vaktbikkje for miljøet], ''Uniforum'', 22 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ProSus was discontinued as a separate programme in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Nyheter/Nye+vilkar+for+ProSus+fra+2006/1236685409823 Nye vilkår for ProSus fra 2006], [[Research Council of Norway]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The centre is placed directly under the University Board of the University of Oslo. Its Board comprises representatives from the relevant faculties of the university, that is the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts, Natural Sciences, and Law. In addition, the Board has two members not connected to the university. The current director is [[Kristi Anne Stølen]].

It is funded by the University as well as organizations such as the [[Research Council of Norway]], NUFU (the Norwegian Universities' Committee for Development Research and Education), the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of the Environment|Ministry of the Environment]], [[NORAD]] and the [[World Bank]].

More than 50 people are affiliated with the Centre for Development and the Environment. The centre hosts the [[Arne Næss]] Programme on Global Justice and the Environment, which includes the Arne Næss Chair, which is awarded each year to "one or several scholars of international standing who have made a significant contribution to the study of global justice and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sum.uio.no/english/research/projects/arne-ness-chair/ Arne Næss Programme on Global Justice and the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' project, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a public integrated [[digital library]], database, and [[search engine]] for scientific papers in [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemXSeer|work=Critical Zone Exploration Network|publisher=National Science Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn State (2007, July 26). Researchers Create Search Engine To Hunt Molecules Online |newspaper=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070726210910.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' was conceived by Dr. Prasenjit Mitra, [[Lee Giles|Dr. Lee Giles]] and Dr. Karl Mueller as a way to integrate the chemical scientific literature with experimental, analytical, and simulation data from different types of experimental systems. The goal of the project is to create an intelligent search and database which will provide access to relevant data to a diverse community of users who have a need for chemical information. It is hosted on the [[World Wide Web]] at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The [[Pennsylvania State University]].

== Features ==
In order to provide access to relevant data to users '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides new features that are not available in traditional search engines or digital libraries.
# [[Chemical molecule|Chemical Entity]] Search: A tool capable of identifying [[Chemical formula|chemical formuale]] and [[chemical name]]s, and extracting and disambiguating them from general terms within documents. Those disambiguated terms are used for performing searches.
# TableSeer: In scholarly articles Tables are used to present, list, summarize, and structure important data. TableSeer automatically identifies tables in digital documents, extracts the table [[Metadata]] as well as the cells content, and stores them in such a way that allows users to either query the table content or search for tables in a large set of documents.
# Dataset search: '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides tools to incorporate datasets from different experiments sources. The system is able to manipulate results from multiple formats such as [[XML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], and [[CHARMM]], create databases, to allow direct queries over the data, create [[Metadata]], using an annotation tool, which will allow users to search over the datasets, as well as a way to create links among datasets and/or between datasets and documents.

In addition to these tools, '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' will integrate the advances made by its sister project [[CiteSeerX|CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;]] to provide:
* Full text search
* Author, affiliation, title and venue search
* Citation and acknowledgement search
* Citation linking and statistics

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13056">'''Chronological dating''', or simply '''dating''', is the process of attributing to an object or event a date in the past, allowing such object or event to be located in a previously established [[chronology]]. This usually requires what is commonly known as a "dating method". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, [[history]], [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[astronomy]] and even [[forensic science]], since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past in which the death of a [[cadaver]] occurred.

== Dating methods ==

Dating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: [[relative dating]] and [[absolute dating]].

=== Relative dating ===
{{Main article|Relative dating}}
[[Relative dating]] methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, [[Latin]] terms ''[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]'' and ''[[Terminus post quem|post quem]]'' are usually used to indicate both the oldest and the most recent possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a [[stratum]]. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', not published until 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. "Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V," Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June, 1954): 238-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 1587 is the ''post quem'' dating of Shakespeare's play ''Henry V''. That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, ''post'') 1587.

The same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, [[paleopalynology]] can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time.

For a non-exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following:

* [[Cross-cutting relationships]]
* [[Harris matrix]]
* [[Law of included fragments]]
* [[Law of superposition]]
* [[Principle of original horizontality]]
* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]
* [[Principle of faunal succession]]
* [[Melt inclusions]]
* [[Nitrogen dating]]
* [[Fluorine absorption dating]]
* [[Seriation (archaeology)]]
* [[Sequence dating]] (a type of seriation)
* [[Palynology]] (the study of modern-dated pollens for the relative dating of archaeological strata, also used in [[forensic palynology]])
* [[Paleopalynology]] (also spelt "Palaeopalynology", the study of fossilized pollens for the relative dating of geological strata)
* [[Morphology (archaeology)]]
* [[Typology (archaeology)]]
* [[Varnish microlamination]]
* [[Vole clock]]
* Lead corrosion dating&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry Professor Shimon Reich, a specialist in [[superconductivity]], has demonstrated a method for dating artifacts based on the magnetic properties of [[lead]], a material widely used in Israel and elsewhere in antiquity.  Reich and coworkers found that at cryogenic temperatures, lead becomes a superconductor, but the corrosion products formed from centuries of exposure to air and water ([[lead oxide]] and [[lead carbonate]]) do not superconduct.  On the basis of magnetic measurements and comparison with artifacts that were known (using other techniques) to be up to 2500 years old, the group showed that the mass of lead corrosion products is directly proportional to an object's age (New Journal of Physics, 2003, 5, 99)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, "[https://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/85/8510cover.html Chemistry in the Holy Land]", ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News'', 5 March 2007, page 20, published by American Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusively used in archaeology)

* [[Tephrochronology]]
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]

=== Absolute dating ===
{{Main article|Absolute dating}}
[[Absolute dating]] methods, by using absolute referent criteria, mainly include the [[radiometric dating]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following:

== Dating methods in archaeology ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dating methodologies in archaeology]] --&gt;
Same as [[Geology|geologists]] or [[paleontology|paleontologists]], [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] are also brought to determine the age of ancient materials, but in their case, the areas of their studies are restricted to the history of both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others.

Nevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example [[Pinnacle Point]]'s caves, in the southern coast of [[South Africa]], provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an [[18th century|18th-century]] [[sloop]] whose [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was led in [[South Carolina]] ([[United States]]) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nauticalarch.org/projects/clydesdale-plantation-18th-century-sloop-excavation/ Clydesdale Plantation 18th-Century Sloop Excavation]", [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]], Texas, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all [[archaeological site]]s are likely to be dated by an appropriate method.

Dating material drawn from the [[archaeological record]] can be made by a direct study of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], or may be deduced by [[Archaeological association|association]] with materials found in the [[archaeological context|context]] the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the [[Sequence (archaeological)|sequence]] relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly [[post excavation]], but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called "spot dating" is usually run in tandem with [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of [[archaeological science]] are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of [[Relationship (archaeology)|stratigraphic relationships]].

In addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following:

===Written markers===
* [[Epigraphy]] – analysis of inscriptions, via identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers.
* [[Numismatics]] – many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record.
* [[Palaeography]] – the study of ancient writing, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.

=== Seriation ===
[[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]] is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known [[Style (visual arts)#Style in archaeology|style]] of artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s or pottery.

===Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers===
* [[Paleomagnetism]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Tephrochronology]] (an absolute dating method, see the corresponding list above)

=== Stratigraphic relationships ===

The [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities ("contexts") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.

CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26–28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

[[File:Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (8533-35).jpg|thumb|Cologne Institute for Economic Research
Headquarters in Cologne, Germany
]]

The '''German Economic Institute''' (German: '''Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft''' Köln e.V.) ('''IW''') is a private economic research institute in Germany, which promotes a liberal economic and social order. The German Economic Institute is based in Cologne, Germany, with additional offices in Berlin, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium. 

The IW compiles analyses on economic and social policy issues. As a think tank, it combines research, consultancy and communication services. The research is based on empirical principles and sound scientific methodology. It stands for a socially responsible free market economy in German for the benefit of society as a whole. The institute’s long term goal is to support a liberal economic and social order in Germany and beyond and to improve understanding of how business and society function and interact..

The institute was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|Federation of German Industries]] (BDI). The German Economic Institute is a registered association (e.V.). Its membership consists of some 110 German business and employers' associations as well as a number of individual companies. Membership fees finance the regular scientific research and advocacy. Additionally, the institute conducts research projects and carries out numerous studies financed by third parties, such as public institutions, foundations and businesses.

==IW Group and Governance Structures==

The German Economic Institute has four subsidiaries which together constitute the IW Group. The Group is composed of the core research department (IW Research), a commercial research consultancy (IW Consult), a publishing house (IW Medien), the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme (IW Junior) and an academy (IW Akademie).
Through the organization’s decision-making bodies members contribute to the institute’s general orientation without having any specific influence on the contents of conducts research and the subsidiaries’ daily business. The annual general meeting of the executive board of the German Economic Institute elected Arndt Günter Kirchhoff, CEO of KIRCHHOFF Holding GmbH &amp; Co. KG, as its honorary president.

===IW Research===

Prof. Dr. [[Michael Hüther]] is the Director of the German Economic Institute and head of its management board. The management board consists of the Director, his Deputy Dr. Hans-Peter Fröhlich and the Heads of Research Dr. Hubertus Bardt and Dr. Hans-Peter Klös.

The Berlin Office is led by Dr. Knut Bergmann and the  Brussels Office by Sandra Parthie.

The institute’s research department itself is subdivided into eleven research units.

====Research Units====
* '''Labour Market''' - main focus on employment and unemployment, working conditions and personnel policy.
* '''Vocational qualification and specialists''' – Vocational training, further education, securing skilled personnel and international VET/PET research
* '''Vocational Rehabilitation and Inclusion''' - information resources for maximising the potential of workers with disabilities
* '''Education, Migration and Innovation''' – examining how education and migration contribute to securing a skilled workforce.
* '''Financial and Real Estate Markets''' – monitoring and researching the economic significance of the finance and real estate markets
* '''International Economics and Economic Outlook''' – promoting open markets and sensible business regulation at the European and global levels as well as analyzing the business cycle, economic growth and globalisation and provide advice for policymakers and business associations
* '''Public Finance, Social Security Systems, Income and Wealth Distribution''' – investigating the fiscal consequences of public policy and analysing the incentive effects for companies and private households

* '''Behavioral Economics and Business Ethics''' – investigating the influence of institutions such as values, standards, rules and laws on the state, society, business and individuals

====Cross Functional Research Groups====

Additionally to the eleven research units there are two cross functional research groups staffed by researchers working on the following two issues:
* Big Data Analytics 
* Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecast 
* Microdata and Method Development

===IW Consult===

The IW Consult carries out research, development and knowledge-transfer projects in cooperation with companies, employers' associations, government ministries, foundations and other institutions. IW Consult also runs the office of “ecl@ss”, a digital product standard.

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">A '''cosmological decade''' ('''CÐ''') is a division of the [[Chronology of the universe|lifetime of the cosmos]]. The divisions are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic in size]], with base 10.  Each successive cosmological decade represents a [[ten-fold]] increase in the total [[age of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==As expressed in log (seconds per Ðecade)==
When CÐ is measured in log(&amp;nbsp;seconds/Ð&amp;nbsp;), ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;1 begins at 10 [[second]]s and lasts 90 seconds (until 100 seconds after [[Time Zero]]).  ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;100, the 100th cosmological decade, lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after Time Zero.

There were an infinite number of cosmological decades between the Big Bang and the Planck epoch (or any other point in time).  The current epoch, ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;17.6389, is 10&lt;sup&gt;(17.6389)&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 13.799(21) billion years, since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt; {{cite journal

==As expressed in log (years per Ðecade)==
The cosmological decade can be expressed in log years per decade. In this definition, the 100th cosmological decade lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; years after Time Zero.  To convert to this format, simply divide by seconds per year; or in logarithmic terms, subtract 7.4991116 from the values listed above. Thus when CÐ is expressed in log( years/Ð ), the Planck time could also be expressed as 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;43.2683&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years = 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;50.7674)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years.

In this definition, the current epoch is CÐ (17.6355&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116), or CÐ&amp;nbsp;10.1364. As before, there have been 60.9 cosmological decades between the Planck epoch and the current epoch.

In their view, the history of the universe can be segmented into five eras:
{| class="wikitable"
! Age !! Ðecades !! Process
|-
|Primordial || &amp;minus;50 to +5 || [[Timeline of the Big Bang|from the Planck time until universe becomes transparent to radiation]]

'''Daniel Harold Casriel''' (March 1, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 7, 1983) was an American [[psychiatrist]], [[psychoanalyst]] and writer from [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;The New York Times; Obituary June 10, 1983, Friday Late City Final Edition, Section D, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today. His novel road map to happiness evolved into a framework for the field of [[relationship education]] as the [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] relationship roadmap for couples.&lt;ref name="BuildingRelationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMaria|first1=Rita|title=Building Intimate Relationships|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1135454396|pages=28-31|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Casriel also founded the [[Daytop]] treatment centers.

==Early life and education==
Daniel Harold Casriel was born in New York City on 1 March, 1924.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] College of Medicine in 1949 at age twenty-five. In 1950, he began his residency at the Kingsbridge Veterans' Administration Hospital in the [[Bronx]]. Eight months into his residency he was drafted by the military and sent to [[Okinawa]] where he served as an Army psychiatrist for a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry In The U.S. Army: Lessons for Community Psychiatry By Albert Julius Glass, Franklin D. Jones, p.189 http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA434841&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Professional training===
Casriel was a trainee at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research between 1949 and 1953 and spent 7½ years in analysis Dr. Abram Kardiner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/kardiner-abram |title=Abram Kardiner: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date=1981-07-20 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the founder of the first psychoanalytic institute in the United States and a former analysand of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Casriel was also a past president of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians.

===Private practice===
In the winter of 1953 Casriel began private practice as a psychiatrist in New York City.  Shortly thereafter he was appointed as a psychiatric consultant to the Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem and the Court of Special Sessions in Manhattan where he became active in the treatment drug addicts.

===Writer===
In July 1962 Casriel visited the famous [[Synanon]] therapeutic community on the US West coast. So impressed with what he saw there, he moved into the community for a “closer look” and wrote a book about the experience ( "So Fair A House: The story of Synanon"). In February 1963, Casriel gave $2000 to seven members of Synanon to start a community on the East Coast. The result was a house on Greens Farm Road, [[Westport, Connecticut]] directed by Jack Hurst, former president of Synanon in Santa Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jFcmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EQEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1854%2C803173 |title=Sunday Herald; Oct 6, 1963, Page 25 "Synanon Work Extolled by Mag" |publisher=News.google.com |date=1963-10-06 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultancy===
In the summer of the same year, Casriel became the psychiatric consultant for the [[Daytop| Daytop Lodge]] project on Staten Island, a kind of half-way house for the rehabilitation of convicted felons who were addicts. Later, he became cofounder, psychiatric director and medical superintendent of Daytop Village, now one of the world’s largest therapeutic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytop.org/history.html |title=The History of Daytop New York In Substance Abuse Treatment |publisher=Daytop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222234947/http://www.daytop.org/history.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;November 21, 1968, Vol. XIV, No. 6 Schism on 14th Street: The Daytop Explosion

Below, left, Casriel, assists a patient in expressing his anger and feeling of pain ''The New Identity Process'', 1973.]]

===Experiments===
In the fall of 1963, Casriel, now age 39,  began experimenting with group therapy in his private practice in New York.  He began leading groups alone and with peer group leaders like  David A. Deitch, the Synanon director at Westport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |title=David Deitch, Ph.D |publisher=Psychiatry.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055018/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 he released his findings to the public in a book titled "A Scream Away From Happiness" where he describes [[bonding psychotherapy|The New Identity Process]], a group psychotherapy that uses screaming, hugging and affirmations of basic needs.

===Methods===
By the late 1960s, Dr Casriel had extended his private practice to include a small [[therapeutic community]] on the top four floors of his office building. This program he called AREBA, short for ''A''ccelerated ''R''e-education of The ''E''motions, ''B''ehavior and ''A''ttitudes. It consisted of about a dozen beds for young addicts who came to live, "work" and participate in the "New Identity Process". When Casriel died in 1983,  former patient [[Steven Yohay]] expanded the program and became president of AREBA Casriel, Inc.,  today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States.

In the late 1970s, Casriel began teaching his method in several European centers. The German psychiatrist Dr. Walther H. Lechler became one of his students and later employed the ideas extensively in the development of the Herrenalb Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klinik-bad-herrenalb.com/en/content.php?Cont=therapie_konzept&amp;Navi=therapie |title=Celenus Kliniken - Gesundheit als Aufgabe |publisher=Klinik-bad-herrenalb.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of psychotherapy used at the hospital of the same name in South Germany. Another trainee was the Danish psychoanalyst, [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] sanyassin and mystic, Shanti Kristian Dahl-Madsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418125732/http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-18 |title=uniomystica.se/index.html |publisher=Uniomystica.se |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated the new identity process into a life-affirmative approach to spirituality he called  'Spiritual Hedonism',

Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today through the efforts of the International Society of Bonding Psychotherapy which has members in 8 European cities as well as North and South America.

==Influence==

Casriel's novel concept of a "Relationship Road Map" became the foundation of [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] approach to [[relationship education]]. Expanding on [[Horace Mann]]'s focus on the pursuit of happiness as a universal human desire, Casriel theorized that the emotion of love comes from the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeMaria, Rita |title=Building Intimate Relationships |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn= 978-1583910764 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Casriel's theory, "bonding," which he defined as "the unique combination of emotional openness and physical closeness with another human being," is central to sustaining healthy, intimate relationships. Casriel taught that symptoms of bonding deprivation include: "illness, fatigue, depression, rigidity, constriction, isolation, and the range of anti-social behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse, gambling and sex addictions." Casriel considered bonding a biologically-based need similar to the need for food, water, air, and shelter, yet unique as the only biologically-based need people cannot meet for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eisenberg, Seth |author2=PAIRS Foundation |title=PAIRS Essentials |publisher=PAIRS Foundation |location=Florida |year=2007 |pages=72 |isbn= 0985427817 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casriel_web"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casriel|first1=Daniel|title=Quest for Emotional Health|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/20/quest-for-emotional-health/|website=www.danielcasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Casriel died at his home in Manhattan on 7 June 1983 age 59 from a form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ([[ALS]]). He is survived by his wife, the former Olivia Cohen; two sons, Seth, a film editor and producer,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0143885/&lt;/ref&gt; and Lyle, a financial adviser.&lt;ref&gt;https://financialservicesinc.ubs.com/fa/lylecasriel/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}
In the [[broadcasting]] [[industry]], a '''dark''' [[television station|television]] or '''silent''' [[radio station]] is one that has gone [[off the air]] for an indefinite period of time. Usually unlike [[dead air]] (broadcasting only silence), a station that is dark or silent does not even transmit a [[carrier wave|carrier signal]].

==U.S. law==

===Transmitter operations===
According to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), a radio or television station is considered to have gone dark or silent if it is to be off the air for 30 days or longer.  Prior to the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], a "dark" station was required to surrender its [[broadcast license]] to the FCC, leaving it vulnerable to another party applying for it while its current owner was making efforts to get it back on the air.  Following the 1996 landmark [[legislation]], a licensee is no longer required to surrender the license while dark.  Instead, the licensee may apply for a "Notification of Suspension of Operations/Request for Silent STA" (FCC Form 0386), stating the reason why the station has gone silent.

A service can go dark for any number of reasons, including financial resources being drained to continue effective operation of the service as being of [[public good|benefit]] to its [[community of license]]; abandonment for a different channel or to go [[cable TV|cable]]-only; complicated technical adjustments involving [[radio antenna]] repair, requiring the [[mast radiator|broadcast tower]] to be de-energized for the work to be done; [[structure fire]] or [[natural disaster]] that has rendered the facility inoperable; or technical adjustments that would make it prohibitively expensive to perform the work and carry on the normal operations of the station in question.

The service is not required to notify the FCC of silence if the period of silence is less than 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/silent-am-and-fm-broadcast-station-lists |title=Silent AM and FM Broadcast Station Lists |publisher=FCC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108072241/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/silent-am-and-fm-broadcast-station-lists |archivedate=2012-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the period of silence is to last at least 10 days but less than 30 days, the licensee must notify the FCC in writing explaining why the service is silent and an expected return to the air.  A service that expects to be silent for more than 30 days must apply to the FCC using Form 0386, which can be done electronically (preferred method) or by a paper application.  On this application, the date the station has gone dark or its targeted date to go silent must be stated on the application, along with the reason for silence.  The Silent STA ([[special temporary authority]]) is valid for a period of 180 days.  If the station is required to remain off the air beyond the 180-day period, a "Request to Extend STA" must be subsequently filed, along with the reason. However, any broadcast station that is dark (or transmits using facilities different from their license except for operation under STA) for 12 months has their license automatically canceled as a matter of law pursuant to section 312g of the Communications Act as amended. Some stations have been known to re-appear for a week or 2 to keep the license alive (WCKL when owned by the Black United Fund was famous for this as they did it for years) then applying for yet another silent STA.

===Tower-light markings===
While a licensed station is silent, it must continue to meet tower lighting and marking requirements as per [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]].  If a station (silent or otherwise) must shut down its lighting system for an extended period of time (such as it being disabled by a [[lightning]] strike), it is required to notify the FAA immediately.  The station is required to provide the FAA with its assigned tower number, latitude and longitude coordinates, and an anticipated time that the tower light operations will resume.  A licensee has 15 days to make the necessary repairs until the FCC is notified by the FAA.  Once repairs are made, the FAA must be notified that all is well.

===Telecommunications Act of 1996===
The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was created in part to increase the [[accountability]] of broadcasters, while providing requested [[deregulation]] in response to the [[wikt:hardship|hardship]]s of many small-town broadcasters with small audiences and revenues.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, licensees of stations that were listed as "silent" by the FCC (at the time around 400) were warned to either power their facilities back up or their licenses would be canceled permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/decdoc/letter/1996--10--17--silent.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929073826/http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/decdoc/letter/1996--10--17--silent.html |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCC did allow reasonable provision for broadcasters who notified them that they were trying to get back on the air.  Nevertheless, many licenses were canceled, primarily those with abandoned facilities.

In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.&lt;ref&gt;Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.

'''Di-deuterated ethyl linoleate''' (also known as RT001; Di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester, 11,11-D2-Ethyl Linoleate, Ethyl 11,11-D2-Linoleate)&lt;ref&gt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/124037379&lt;/ref&gt; is an experimental, orally-bioavailable synthetic deuterated [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA), an isotopologue of an essential [[omega-6]] PUFA, [[linoleic acid]]. The [[deuterated drug|deuterated]] compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid, is resistant to [[lipid peroxidation]] which makes studies of its [[Lipid_peroxidation#Inhibiting_lipid_peroxidation|cell-protective]] properties worthwhile. 

==Clinical development==
Investigations of 11,11-D2-Ethyl linoleate (RT001) are being conducted in several neurological indications, including [[Friedreich’s ataxia]] and [[Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy]]. A double-blind [[Clinical_trial#Active_control_studies|comparator-controlled]] Phase I/II clinical trial sponsored by [[Retrotope]] and [[Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance]] was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials.&lt;ref&gt; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02445794&lt;/ref&gt; RT001 was promptly absorbed and was found to be safe and tolerable over 28 days at the maximal dose of 9 g/day. It improved [[peak workload]] and [[VO2 max|peak oxygen consumption]] in the test group compared to the control group who received the equal doses of normal, non-deuterated ethyl linoleate.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mds.27353&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 RT001 was given to a patient with [[ALS]] under a "compassionate use scheme".&lt;ref&gt;https://alsnewstoday.com/2018/09/18/experimental-rt001-available-for-als-under-expanded-access-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-D2-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of [[arachidonic_acid]], that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic [[lipid peroxidation]] (LPO) through a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as [[4-Hydroxynonenal|reactive carbonyls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|22705367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''endosperm''' is a tissue produced inside the [[seed]]s of most of the [[flowering plant]]s following fertilization. It surrounds the [[embryo]] and provides nutrition in the form of [[starch]], though it can also contain [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s and [[protein]]. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in animal diet. For example, [[wheat]] endosperm is ground into flour for [[bread]] (the rest of the grain is included as well in [[whole wheat flour]]), while [[barley]] endosperm is the main source of sugars for [[beer]] production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are [[coconut]] "meat" and coconut "water",&lt;ref&gt;[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph10.htm retrieved 14 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maize|corn]]. Some plants, such as [[orchid]]s, lack endosperm in their [[seed]]s.

==Origin of endosperm==

Ancestral flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and abundant endosperm, and the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with mature seeds with little or no endosperm. In more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is non developed or consumed before the seed matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp#evolution |title=The Seed Biology Place - Seed Dormancy |publisher=Seedbiology.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman1998&gt;{{citation | author = Friedman, William E. | year = 1998 | title = The evolution of double fertilization and endosperm: an "historical" perspective | journal = Sexual Plant Reproduction | volume = 11 | page = 6 | doi = 10.1007/s004970050114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double fertilization===
Endosperm is formed when the two [[sperm|sperm nuclei]] inside a [[pollen]] grain reach the interior of a female gametophyte (sometimes called the [[ovule|embryo sac]]). One sperm nucleus fertilizes the [[egg cell]], forming a [[zygote]], while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the binucleate central cell, forming a primary endosperm cell (its nucleus is often called the ''triple fusion nucleus''). That cell created in the process of [[double fertilisation|double fertilization]] develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm constitutes an organism separate from the growing embryo.

About 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are [[polyploid]].&lt;ref name=Olsen2007&gt;{{citation | author = Olsen, By Odd-Arne| year = 2007 | title = Endosperm: Developmental and Molecular Biology | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFEA8Gg5_hAC|journal = | isbn = 9783540712350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically [[triploid]] (containing three sets of chromosomes), but can vary widely from [[diploid]] (2n) to 15n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/rEVIEWS/1026/figure/F1 |title=Figure 1 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-reviews1026 |publisher=genomebiology.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has been shown to have endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a pollen nucleus with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. The same is supposed for some other basal angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identification of diploid endosperm in an early angiosperm lineage |author=Williams J. H., Friedman W. E. |journal=Letters to Nature |volume=415 |issue=6871 |pages=522 |date=2002 |doi=10.1038/415522a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm lineages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{citation | last = Friedman | first =  William E. | year = 2003 | title = Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants| journal = Evolution| volume = 57| pages = 216–30| doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118867819/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 | pmid = 12683519 | last2 = Williams | first2 = JH | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endosperm formation===
There are three types of Endosperm development:

'''Nuclear endosperm formation''' - where repeated free-nuclear divisions take place; if a cell wall is formed it will form after free-nuclear divisions. Commonly referred to as liquid endosperm. Coconut water is an example of this.

'''Cellular endosperm formation''' - where a cell-wall formation is coincident with nuclear divisions. Coconut meat is cellular endosperm. Acoraceae has cellular endosperm development while other monocots are helobial.

'''Helobial endosperm formation''' - Where a cell wall is laid down between the first two nuclei, after which one half develops endosperm along the cellular pattern and the other half along the nuclear pattern.

== Evolutionary origins ==
The evolutionary origins of double fertilization and endosperm are unclear, attracting researcher attention for over a century. There are the two major hypotheses:&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/reviews/1026 Célia Baroux, Charles Spillane, Ueli Grossniklaus (2002)]. Evolutionary origins of the endosperm in flowering plants. Genome Biol. 3(9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The double fertilization initially used to produce two identical, independent embryos ("twins"). Later these embryos acquired different roles, one growing into the mature organism, and another merely supporting it. Thus the early endosperm was probably diploid, like the embryo. Some [[gymnosperms]], such as ''[[Ephedra (genus)]]'', may produce twin embryos by double fertilization. Either of these two embryos is capable of filling in the seed, but normally only one develops further (the other eventually aborts). Also, most basal angiosperms still contain the four-cell embryo sac and produce diploid endosperms.
* Endosperm is the evolutionary remnant of the actual [[gametophyte]], similar to the complex multicellular gametophytes found in gymnosperms. In this case, acquisition of the additional nucleus from the sperm cell is a later evolutionary step. This nucleus may provide the parental (not only maternal) organism with some control over endosperm development. Becoming triploid or polyploid are later evolutionary steps of this "primary gametophyte". Nonflowering seed plants (conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, Ephedra) form a large homozygous female gametophyte to nourish the embryo within a seed.&lt;ref&gt;[Friedman WE (1995)] Organismal duplication, inclusive fitness theory, and altruism: understanding the evolution of endosperm and the angiosperm reproductive syndrome. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 25;92(9):3913-7.{{PMID|11607532}}[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42072/pdf/pnas01493-0289.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of endosperm in seed development==
In some groups (e.g. grains of the family [[Poaceae]]) the endosperm persists to the mature seed stage as a storage tissue, in which case the seeds are called "albuminous" or "endospermous", and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g., most members of the family [[Fabaceae]], including the [[common bean]], ''Phaseolus vulgaris''), in which case the seeds are called "exalbuminous" or "cotyledonous" and the function of storage tissue is performed by enlarged [[cotyledons]] ("seed leaves"). In certain species (e.g. corn, ''Zea mays''); the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo.  Some mature endosperm tissue stores fats (e.g. [[castor bean]], ''Ricinus communis'') and others (including grains, such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches.

The dust-like seeds of [[orchid]]s have no endosperm. Orchid seedlings are [[mycoheterotrophy|mycoheterotrophic]] in their early development. In some other species, such as [[coffee]], the endosperm also does not develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Houk | first1 = W. G. | title = Endosperm and Perisperm of Coffee with Notes on the Morphology of the Ovule and Seed Development | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–61 | doi = 10.2307/2436631 | year = 1938 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2436631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the [[nucellus]] produces a nutritive tissue termed "perisperm". The endosperm of some species is responsible for [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mechanisms of plant growth and improved productivity: modern approaches edited by  Amarjit S. Basra 1994.
{{ISBN|0-8247-9192-4}} p.&lt;/ref&gt; Endosperm tissue also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo, it acts as a location for gene imprinting, and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents.&lt;ref name="Olsen2007"/&gt; In angiosperms, the endosperm contain hormones such as [[cytokinin]]s, which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic organ formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Pearson, Lorentz C. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The diversity and evolution of plants | year=1995 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton  | isbn=0-8493-2483-1 | page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cereal grains==
[[Cereal]] crops are grown for their edible [[fruit]] ([[cereal|grains]] or [[caryopsis|caryopses]]), which are primarily endosperm. In the caryopsis, the thin fruit wall is fused to the seed coat. Therefore, the nutritious part of the grain is the seed and its endosperm. In some cases (e.g. wheat, rice) the endosperm is selectively retained in food processing (commonly called white flour), and the embryo (germ) and seed coat (bran) removed. The processed grain has a lower quality of nutrition. Endosperm thus has an important role within the human diet worldwide.

The [[aleurone]] is the outer layer of endosperm cells, present in all small grains and retained in many dicots with transient endosperm. The cereal aleurone functions for both storage and digestion. During germination, it secretes the [[amylase]] enzyme that breaks down endosperm starch into sugars to nourish the growing seedling.&lt;ref&gt;Becraft, P.W., and Yi, G. (2011). Regulation of aleurone development in cereal grains. J Exp Bot 62, 1669-1675.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrance grave''' is a term given by [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] found in parts of [[Atlantic Europe]], dating the early to middle [[Bronze Age]].

Tombs of this type are covered with a round earth mound and contain a single chamber where the entrance area merges with the burial area itself, simply through a slight change in the alignment of the stone slab walls. They are also known as '''undifferentiated passage graves'''.

Entrance graves are found in Southern Spain and all along the Atlantic coast to [[Brittany]]. They are also present in southern [[Ireland]], the [[Isles of Scilly]] and [[Cornwall]].

An example is the [[Scillonian entrance grave]] group.

{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8958">'''Erik Adigard des Gautries''' (1953) is a [[Graphic designer|communication designer]], multimedia artist and educator based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A co-founder of M-A-D, a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]-based design firm. He is a former design contributor to [[Wired magazine]].

== Biography ==
Adigard was born in [[Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Erik_Adigard|title=Erik Adigard|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was stationed as a French foreign correspondent. His grandfather is {{ill|Jean Adigard des Gautries|fr}}, a noted historian and a Legion of Honour recipient. When Adigard was ten his family returned to Paris. He began his university studies in English Literature, Semiotics, and Fine Arts in France before coming to the United States to obtain a BFA (1987) in Graphic Design at California College of the Arts (CCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cca.edu/|title=California College of the Arts|website=cca.edu|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student, Adigard's first designs earned him national awards for their experimental mix of iconography and offset printing techniques. Upon graduation, with [[Patricia McShane]], he established M-A-D—also known as "madxs", a brand and communications design studio. Since creating his first digital images for Macworld magazine in 1989 he has been exploring the limits of the graphic design discipline as it continues to be redefined by shifting relationships with technology and social phenomena. His activities range from branding, print, web, video and multimedia, to consulting and exhibits—always with a concern for conceptual accuracy and creative innovation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1992 he participated in the launch of Wired magazine by conceiving its first visual essay, and then continued to develop a visual vernacular specific to Wired and often labeled "Wired look". In 1996-1998 he served as design director for WiredVentures where he designed new web offerings, including the Hotbot search engine, WiredNews and the ground breaking LiveWired.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

His short documentary, ''Webdreamer'', a portrait of fellow web designers, was featured in international film festivals such as [[RESFest|RESfest]] and the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999 he co-authored ''Architecture Must Burn'' with Aaron Betsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Must-Burn-Manifestoes-Future/dp/1584230304/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358198560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architecture+must+burn|title = Architecture Must Burn Manifestoes for the Future of Architecture|last = Betsky|first = Aaron|last2 = Adigard|first2 = Erik|date = 2001-08-01|publisher = Gingko Press|isbn = 9781584230304|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 until 2004 Adigard developed brand strategy for IBM software, creating a graphic system that allowed for five distinct brands; [[IBM DB2|DB2]], Lotus, Tivoli, [[Rational Software|Rational]], and [[IBM WebSphere|Websphere]], to combine into an integrated offering. This brand system included a visual campaign that was in continual use throughout the decade.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13992">'''Antonio di Pietro Averlino''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo di ˈpjɛːtro averˈliːno}}; c. 1400 – c. 1469), also "Averulino", known as '''''Filarete''''' ({{IPA-it|filaˈrɛːte}}; from {{lang-el|φιλάρετος}}, meaning "lover of excellence"), was a [[Florentine Renaissance]] [[architect]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], [[medallist]], and architectural theorist. He is perhaps best remembered for his design of the ideal city of [[Sforzinda]], the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
Antonio di Pietro Averlino was born c. 1400 in [[Florence]] where he probably trained as a craftsman. Sources suggest that he worked in Florence under the Italian painter, architect, and biographer [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], who gave him his more famous name “Filarete” which means “a lover of virtue”. In the mid 15th century, Filarete was expelled from [[Rome]] after being accused of attempting to steal the head of [[John the Baptist]] and he moved to [[Venice]] and then eventually to [[Milan]]. There he became a ducal engineer and worked on a variety of architectural projects for the next fifteen years. According to his biographer, [[Vasari]], Filarete died in Rome c. 1469.&lt;ref&gt;'Il Filarete.' ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993.

===Bronze doors of Old St. Peter's Basilica===
A commission granted by [[Pope Eugene IV]] meant that Filarete, over the course of twelve years, cast the [[bronze]] central doors for [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]], which were completed in 1445.&lt;ref&gt;Ghiberti's great bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] preceded this. In the following century, Filarete's doors were preserved when Old St Peter's was demolished and they were later reinstalled in the new [[St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were created during the Renaissance, the doors have distinct Byzantine influences and seem tied to the Medieval era. Some critics have noted that the doors offer a glimpse into the mind of Filarete, claiming that they show his “mind of medieval complexity crammed full of exciting but not quite assimilated classical learning”.&lt;ref&gt;Roeder, Helen. 'The Borders of Filarete's Bronze Doors to St. Peters'. ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 10, (1947), pp. 150-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural works===
[[Image:Milano Castello 1.jpg|150pz|thumb|Milan]][[Image:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|Filarete: ''Sforzinda'']]
In Milan Filarete built the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] (c. 1456), the overall form of which was rationally planned as a cross within a square, with the hospital church at the center of the plan. Some of the surviving sections of the much-rebuilt structure show the Gothic detail of Milan's ''[[quattrocento]]'' craft traditions, which are at odds with Filarete's design ''all'antica'' or "after the Antique".&lt;ref&gt;Murray 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Filarete also worked on the [[Castello Sforzesco]] or Sforza Castle and on the [[Duomo di Milano]] or Milan Cathedral.

===Filarete's treatise on architecture and the ideal city of Sforzinda===
Filarete completed his substantial book on architecture sometime around 1464, which he referred to as his ''Libro architettonico'' ("Architectonic book").  Neither he nor his immediate contemporaries ever referred to it as a ''Trattato'' ("Treatise"), though it is usually now called such.  The ''Libro'', which comprises twenty-five volumes, enjoyed a fairly wide circulation in manuscript form during the Renaissance. The most well known and best preserved copy of the ''Libro'' is a profusely illustrated manuscript known as the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' (probably drafted c. 1465; now held in the archives of the [http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]). The fact that the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' is dedicated to [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and was conserved in Florence suggests that Filarete was well regarded in his native Florence despite his loyalty to Milan. The book, which is written as a fictional narrative, consists principally of a detailed account of the technical aspects of architecture (e.g., site and material selection, drawing, construction methods, and so on) and a sustained polemic against the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] of Northern Italy, which Filarete calls the "barbarous modern style." Filarete argues instead for the use of [[Romanesque architecture|classical Roman]] models.

The most famous part of his book is his plan for Sforzinda, an [[ideal city]] named after [[Francesco Sforza]], then Duke of Milan.  Although Sforzinda was never built, certain aspects of its design are described in considerable detail. The basic layout of the city is an eight-point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete’s interest in magic and astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, Spiro. ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings.'' London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with ''Quattrocento'' or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda. His architectonical drawings and even more his allegorical drawings traced on the margins of the Codex Magliabechianus - such as the Allegory of Vertue and the Allegory of the Reason and Will - Filarete shows a remarkable possession of classical sources, maybe known also through the advice of his friend Francesco Filelfo da Tolentino, the main humanist then at the court of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;P. Coen, "La allegoria della Virtù di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete" in Le due Rome del Quattrocento, ed. S. Rossi and S. Valeri, Rome, 1994; P. Coen, Il problema della Ragione e della Volontà: il contributo di un'allegoria di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete", in Arte Lombarda, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares – one for the prince’s palace, one for the cathedral, and one for the market. Because the Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete’s House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-storey structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]’s Earthly City, whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. 'The Ideal City from Plato to Howard', ''Architectural Review'' 112. Aug. 1952, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the Italian cities of the Medieval period, whose growth did not necessarily depend on city planning as such, which meant they could be difficult to navigate.&lt;ref&gt;Madanipour, Ali. ''Designing the City of Reason: Foundation and Frameworks.'' New York: Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in [[Plato]]'s description of [[Atlantis]]. Filarete’s ideal plan was meant to reflect on society – where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance ideal city implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of [[Dante]]’s that “The human race is at its best under a monarch.”&lt;ref&gt;Alighieri, Dante. ''De Monarchia'', c. 1312&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny.

==Influence on architecture and urbanism==
Filarete's plan of Sforzinda was the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance and his thorough organization of its layout embodied a greater level of conscious city planning than anyone before him. Despite the many references to medieval symbolism incorporated into Sforzinda's design, the city's principles became the archetype for the humanist city during the High Renaissance. The treatise gained interest from many important leaders such as Giangaleazzo Sforza and [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and later when [[Francesco di Giorgio]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] began to plan their ideal cities they borrowed ideas from Filarete.&lt;ref&gt;"Il Filarete." ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://0-galenet.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/servlet/BioRC{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was never built, Sforzinda served as an inspiration for many future city plans. For example, in the 16th century, Renaissance military engineers and architects combined Filarete's ideal city schemes with defensive fortifications deriving from a more sociopolitical agenda. This notion of combining the ideal and the fortified city became widely disseminated throughout Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7240">The '''free-fall time''' is the characteristic [[time]] that would take a body to collapse under its own [[gravity|gravitational attraction]], if no other forces existed to oppose the collapse. As such, it plays a fundamental role in setting the timescale for a wide variety of astrophysical processes—from [[star formation]] to [[helioseismology]] to [[supernova]]e—in which gravity plays a dominant role.

==Derivation==

===Infall to a point source of gravity===
It is relatively simple to derive the free-fall time by applying nothing more than [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]] of planetary motion to a [[degenerate elliptic orbit]]. Consider a point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; a distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from a [[point source]] of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which falls radially inward to it. Crucially, [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]] depends only on the [[semi-major axis]] of the orbit, and does not depend on the [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]]. A purely radial trajectory is an example of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1 and semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;R/2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the time it would take a body to fall inward, turn around, and return to its original position is the same as the period of a circular orbit of radius &lt;math&gt;R/2&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{orbit}} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt {G(M+m)}} \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^{3/2}=\frac{\pi R^{3/2}}{\sqrt{2 G(M+m)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To see that the semi-major axis is &lt;math&gt;R/2&lt;/math&gt;, we must examine properties of orbits as they become increasingly elliptical. Kepler's First Law states that an orbit is an ellipse with the center of mass as one focus. In the case of a very small mass falling toward a very large mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the center of mass is within the larger mass.  The focus of an ellipse is increasingly off-center with increasing ellipticity. In the limiting case of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1, the orbit extends from the initial position of the infalling object (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) to the point source of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the ellipse becomes a line of length &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. The semi-major axis is half the width of the ellipse along the long axis, which in the degenerate case becomes &lt;math&gt;R/2&lt;/math&gt;.

If the free-falling body completed a full orbit, it would begin at distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the point source mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, fall inward until it reached that point source, then turn around and journey back to its original position.  In real systems, the point source mass isn't truly a point source and the infalling body eventually collides with some surface. Thus, it only completes half the orbit. But since the infalling part of the orbit is symmetric to the hypothetical outgoing portion of the orbit, we can simply divide the period of the full orbit by two to attain the free-fall time (the time along the infalling portion of the orbit).

:&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{ff}}=t_{\text{orbit}}/2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{R^{3/2}}{ \sqrt{2 G(M+m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula also follows from the [[Free_fall#Inverse-square_law_gravitational_field|formula for the falling time as a function of position]].

Note that &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{orbit}}&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation, is the time for the mass to fall in a highly eccentric orbit, make a "hairpin" turn at the central mass at nearly zero radius distance, and then returns to '''R''' when it repeats the very sharp turn. This orbit corresponds to nearly linear motion back and from distance '''R''' to distance 0. As noted above, this orbit has only '''half''' as long a semimajor axis ('''R/2''') as a circular orbit with radius '''R''' (where the semimajor axis is '''R'''), and thus the period for the shorter high-eccentricity "orbit" is that for one with an axis of '''R/2''' and a total orbital pathlength of only twice the infall distance. Thus, by Kepler's third law, with half the semimajor axis radius it thus takes only (1/2)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; = (1/8)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; as long a time period, as the "corresponding" circular orbit that has a constant radius the same as the maximal radius of the eccentric orbit (which goes to essentially zero radius from the primary at its other extreme). 

The time to traverse half the distance '''R''', which is the infall time from '''R''' along an eccentric orbit, is the Kepler time for a circular orbit of '''R/2''' (not R), which is (1/32)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; times the period '''P''' of the circular orbit at '''R'''. For example, the time for an object in the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, to fall into the Sun if it were suddenly stopped in orbit, would be &lt;math&gt;P/\sqrt{32}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''P''' is one year. This is about 64.6 days.

===Infall of a spherically-symmetric distribution of mass===
Now, consider a case where the mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is not a point mass, but is distributed in a spherically-symmetric distribution about the center, with an average mass density of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{3 M}{4 \pi R^3}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where the volume of a sphere is:&lt;math&gt; {(4/3) \pi R^3}.&lt;/math&gt; 

Let us assume that the only force acting is gravity. Then, as first demonstrated by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and can easily be demonstrated using the [[divergence theorem]], the acceleration of gravity at any given distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the sphere depends only upon the total mass contained within &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. The consequence of this result is that if one imagined breaking the sphere up into a series of concentric shells, each shell would collapse only subsequent to the shells interior to it, and no shells cross during collapse. As a result, the free-fall time of a massless particle at &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed solely in terms of the total mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; interior to it. In terms of the average density interior to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the free-fall time is&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994sse..book.....K Stellar Structure and Evolution] Kippenhahn, Rudolf; Weigert, Alfred. Springer-Verlag, 1994, 3rd Ed. p.257 {{ISBN|3-540-58013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho}}\simeq 0.5427 \frac{1}{ \sqrt {G \rho}}\simeq 66430\,{\rm s} \frac{1}{ \sqrt {\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the latter is in [[SI]] units.

This result is exactly the same as from the previous section when :&lt;math&gt;M \gg m&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The free-fall time is a very useful estimate of the relevant timescale for a number of astrophysical processes. To get a sense of its application, we may write

:&lt;math&gt;t_{\text{ff}} \simeq \frac{35 \, \mbox{min}}{\sqrt{\rho}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\mbox{g}}{\mbox{cm}^3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have estimated the numerical value for the free-fall time as roughly 35 minutes for a body of mean density 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Comparison==
For an object falling from infinity in a [[capture orbit]], the time it takes from a given position to fall to the central point mass is the same as the free-fall time, except for a constant &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3\pi}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.42.

'''Granule cell dispersion''' is one of the abnormal structural changes that has been shown in brains of patients with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]]. It has also been shown in different animal models, such as the [[kainic acid]] model,&lt;ref name="Murphy BL 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Brian L|author2=Rylon D.

It was first described by Houser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houser|first=Carolyn R|title=Granule cell dispersion in the dentate gyrus of humans with temporal lobe epilepsy.|journal=Brain Research|date=December 1990|volume=535|issue=2|pages=195–204|pmid=1705855|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)91601-c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal situation, the granule cells in [[dentate gyrus]] should be tightly packed. But in granule cell dispersion, the compact formation was lost, and the axons need to extend longer to reach the neighboring granule cells.

==Mechanism of formation==
There are currently two hypotheses for the mechanism. It might be a consequence of a migration disorder, and the first hypothesis considers an initial injury that release toxin(s) that affect the normal [[migration of granule cells]].  The second hypothesis concerns the role of reelin (see below).

===Reelin role in temporal lobe epilepsy===
[[Reelin]] is required for normal neuronal lamination humans, and the lack of this expression can lead to migration defect associated with temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;ref name="Haas 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hass|first=Carola A|author2=Oliver Dudeck |author3=Matthias Kirsch |author4=Csaba Huszka |author5=Gunda Kann |author6=Stefan Pollak |author7=Josef Zentner |author8=Michael Frotscher |title=Role for Reelin in the Development of Granule Cell Dispersion in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 July 2002|volume=22|issue=14|pages=5797–5802|pmid=12122039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Clifford Fassett''' (1870–1953) worked for the [[United States Fish Commission]] and later the [[United States Bureau of Fisheries]]. He became an expert on the [[salmon]] fisheries in [[Alaska]] and was also a map-maker and photographer.

Fassett was born May 9, 1870, in Contra Costa Co., California.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web| title = Biographical Sketch by Sharon Landwehr, Archives Volunteer, Californian Academy of Science |url= http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/library/special/bios/Fassett.pdf | accessdate=14 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Myra Beck in 1919. Harry and Myra Fassett were residents of [[San Francisco]] from 1934 and Harry Fassett was member of [[California Academy of Sciences]] from 1945 until his death on December 9, 1953.&lt;ref name="SL"/&gt;

==Early career with the United States Fish Commission==
In 1889 Fassett jointed [[USS Albatross (1882)|''USFC Albatross'']] as a captain's clerk.  In 1893 and 1894 Fassett was engaged in chart-making on the [[Northern fur seal]] and fishery investigations carried out by the [[United States Fish Commission]] on [[USS Albatross (1882)|''USFC Albatross'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penbay.org/cof/COF_1894_4.pdf ''Report Upon the Inquiry Respecting Food-Fishes and the Fishing-Grounds'', Richard Rathbun, Assistant in Charge (1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;  His duties expanded to include photography using a glass-plate [[camera]] on the Alaskan salmon research cruises conducted from 1894 to 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission'', VOL. XVIII, George M. Bowers (1898) F. M. Chamberlain and H. C. Fassett referred to as both rendering valuable service in photography&lt;/ref&gt;

As captain’s clerk on the 1889-1900 Pacific cruise of [[USS Albatross (1882)|''USFC Albatross'']] conducted by the [[United States Fish Commission]], Fassett was engaged in chart making&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/dl/expeditions/011521796 Paumotu archipelago, South Pacific Ocean:  sketch of the west shore of Fakarava Atoll from Nqaruae pass to the south point   / by the officers of the U.S.F.C. Str. 'Albatross' in October 1899, Comdr Jeff'n F. Moser, U.S.N. Com'd'g; copy by H. C. Fassett].&lt;/ref&gt; and photography; recording people, communities and scenes during this voyage using a glass-plate [[camera]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov Records of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Archives &amp; Records Administration, U.S.].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[USS Albatross (1882)|''USFC Albatross'']] sailed from San Francisco on 23 August 1899, into the South and Central Pacific, visiting the [[Marquesas]], [[Paumotu]], [[Society Islands]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Tonga]], [[Fiji]], [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]], [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]] and the [[Ladrone Islands]]. The ship visited [[Japan]], departing [[Yokohama]] on 2 June 1900 to visit [[Hakodate]], Japan, and [[Kamchatka]], north of the [[Aleutian Islands]], and collected biological specimens in the North Pacific and into the [[Bering Sea]] and ultimately returned to [[San Francisco]] on 30 October 1900 after a cruise of 14 months.

==Later career with the United States Bureau of Fisheries==
In 1902, the [[United States Fish Commission]] was reorganized as the [[United States Bureau of Fisheries]] and was made part of the newly created [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor]]. By 1907 Fassett is titled in official publications as a fishery 
expert,&lt;ref&gt;Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Fisheries, George M. Bowers, Commissioner, ''Some Observations on Salmon and Trout in Alaska'', Bureau of Fisheries Document No, 627, Washington, Government Printing Office (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the ''Albatross Philippine Expedition'',&lt;ref&gt;David G. Smith, Jeffrey T. Williams, ''The Great Albatross Philippine Expedition and Its Fishes'', Marine Fisheries Review, Fall, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  from 16 October 1907 to 4 May 1910, conducted by the [[United States Bureau of Fisheries]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]],  under Commander Marbury Johnston and Hugh  McCormick Smith, Deputy Commissioner of Fisheries, Director of the Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/search/sia_search_collections|title=Collections Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1911 to 1919, Fassett  represented the United States Bureau of Fisheries in Alaska and was involved in further salmon research in [[Alaska]] and the [[Pribilof Islands]] fur seal investigations.&lt;ref name="SL"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Two topographical features of [[Alaska]] are named in his honor: Fassett Point on [[Kodiak Island]] and a glacier near [[Yakutat, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;Latitude: 59.31333; Longitude: -138.53889&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">The '''Hubert Curien Laboratory''' or ''Laboratoire Hubert Curien ''is a joint research unit (UMR 5516) of [[Jean Monnet University|the University of Saint-Etienne]], the National Research Centre [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], and (since 2016) the [[École supérieure d'optique|Institut d'Optique Graduate School]]. It is composed of about 90 researchers, professors and assistant professors, 20 	engineers and administrative staff, and 130 Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researcher. This makes the Hubert Curien Laboratory with a total of about 240 staff the most important research structure of [[Saint-Etienne]].

The various research activities of the laboratory are organized into two scientific departments:  "[[Optics]], [[photonics]] and [[microwave]]" and "[[Computer science]], [[Telecommunication|telecom]] and [[Image analysis|image]]". The research activity is structured into scientific projects within 6 main teams: "Micro/Nano structuring", "Radiation-matter Interaction", "Image Science &amp; computer vision", "Data Intelligence", "Connected Intelligence" and "Secure Embedded Systems &amp; Hardware Architectures."

The Hubert Curien laboratory coordinates the laboratory of excellence MANUTECH-SISE and the equipment of excellence MANUTECH-USD in partnership with some laboratories of the [[University of Lyon]] (LTDS, LDF, LaMCoS) and the company HEF. The partners aim at understanding the surface phenomena such as
[[wear]], [[friction]], [[wetting]], etc. They also aim at creating and controlling the surface functionalities, and at developing advanced manufacturing processes of surfaces and interfaces of different level, in particular processes of  ultrafast laser texturation.

In the last few years, the laboratory has paying a special attention to interdisciplinary scientific projects including in materials and surface engineering, in [[image processing]], in [[Computer vision]] or in [[artificial intelligence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30059">'''Hypercomputation''' or '''super-Turing computation''' refers to models of computation that can provide outputs that are not [[Turing computable]]. For example, a machine that could solve the [[halting problem]] would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that can [[Entscheidungsproblem|correctly evaluate every statement]] in [[Peano arithmetic]].

The [[Church–Turing thesis]] states that any "effectively computable" function that can be computed by a mathematician with a pen and paper using a finite set of simple algorithms, can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers compute functions that a Turing machine cannot and which are, hence, not effectively computable in the Church–Turing sense.

Technically the output of a [[random Turing machine]] is uncomputable; however, most hypercomputing literature focuses instead on the computation of useful, rather than random, uncomputable functions.

==History==
A computational model going beyond Turing machines was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1938 PhD dissertation ''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Turing, 1939, ''Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals'' Proceedings London Mathematical Society Volumes 2–45, Issue 1, pp. 161–228.[http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s2-45/1/161.extract]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper investigated mathematical systems in which an [[Oracle machine|oracle]] was available, which could compute a single arbitrary (non-recursive) function from [[Natural number|naturals]] to naturals. He used this device to prove that even in those more powerful systems, [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] is still present. Turing's oracle machines are mathematical abstractions, and are not physically realizable.&lt;ref&gt;"Let us suppose that we are supplied with some unspecified means of solving number-theoretic problems; a kind of oracle as it were. We shall not go any further into the nature of this oracle apart from saying that it cannot be a machine" (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;167, a reprint of Turing's paper ''Systems of Logic Based On Ordinals'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==State space==
In a sense, most functions are uncomputable: there are [[Aleph 0|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]] computable functions, but there are an [[uncountable]] number (&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;) of possible Super-Turing functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/CabessaSiegelmannNC12.pdf |author1=J. Cabessa |author2=H.T. Siegelmann | title=The Computational Power of  Interactive Recurrent Neural Networks | journal=Neural Computation | volume=24 | number=4 | pages=996–1019 | date=Apr 2012 | doi=10.1162/neco_a_00263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypercomputer models==
Hypercomputer models range from useful but probably unrealizable (such as Turing's original oracle machines), to less-useful random-function generators that are more plausibly "realizable" (such as a [[random Turing machine]]).

===Hypercomputers with uncomputable inputs or black-box components===
A system granted knowledge of the uncomputable, oracular [[Chaitin's constant]] (a number with an infinite sequence of digits that encode the solution to the halting problem) as an input can solve a large number of useful undecidable problems; a system granted an uncomputable random-number generator as an input can create random uncomputable functions, but is generally not believed to be able to meaningfully solve "useful" uncomputable functions such as the halting problem. There are an unlimited number of different types of conceivable hypercomputers, including:

*Turing's original oracle machines, defined by Turing in 1939.

This might require quite bizarre laws of physics (for example, a measurable [[physical constant]] with an oracular value, such as [[Chaitin's constant]]), and would require the ability to measure the real-valued physical value to arbitrary precision.

**Similarly, a proposed model known as [[fair nondeterminism]] can accidentally allow the oracular computation of noncomputable functions, because some such systems, by definition, have the oracular ability to identify reject inputs that would "unfairly" cause a subsystem to run forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nondeterminism, Fairness and a Fundamental Analogy|journal=EATCS bulletin|volume=37|pages=186–193|year=1989|author1=Edith Spaan |author2=Leen Torenvliet |author3=Peter van Emde Boas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ord, Toby.

*Dmytro Taranovsky has proposed a [[finitism|finitistic]] model of traditionally non-finitistic branches of analysis, built around a Turing machine equipped with a rapidly increasing function as its oracle. By this and more complicated models he was able to give an interpretation of second-order arithmetic. These models require an uncomputable input, such as a physical event-generating process where the interval between events grows at an uncomputably large rate.&lt;ref name=Taranovsky&gt;{{cite web | author=Dmytro Taranovsky | date=July 17, 2005 | title=Finitism and Hypercomputation | url=http://web.mit.edu/dmytro/www/FinitismPaper.htm | accessdate=Apr 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Similarly, one unorthodox interpretation of a model of [[unbounded nondeterminism]] posits, by definition, that the length of time required for an "Actor" to settle is fundamentally unknowable, and therefore it cannot be proven, within the model, that it does not take an uncomputably long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Carl. "What Is Commitment." Physical, Organizational, and Social (Revised), Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems II: AAMAS (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- There is also an argument in Hewitt 2006 that this model is justified in the physical world, but this appears to be unbased [[WP:FRINGE]] speculation that I can't find anyone else endorsing or even explicitly acknowledging. --&gt;

==="Infinite computational steps" models===
In order to work correctly, certain computations by the machines below literally require infinite, rather than merely unlimited but finite, physical space and resources; in contrast, with a Turing machine, any given computation that halts will require only finite physical space and resources.

*A Turing machine that can ''complete'' infinitely many steps in finite time, a feat known as a [[supertask]]. Simply being able to run for an unbounded number of steps does not suffice. One mathematical model is the [[Zeno machine]] (inspired by [[Zeno's paradox]]). The Zeno machine performs its first computation step in (say) 1 minute, the second step in ½ minute, the third step in ¼ minute, etc.  By summing [[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + · · ·|1+½+¼+...]] (a [[geometric series]]) we see that the machine performs infinitely many steps in a total of 2 minutes. According to Shagrir, Zeno machines introduce physical paradoxes and its state is logically undefined outside of one-side open period of [0, 2), thus undefined exactly at 2 minutes after beginning of the computation.&lt;ref&gt;These models have been independently developed by many different authors, including {{cite book|author=[[Hermann Weyl]]|  year=1927 | title=Philosophie der Mathematik und Naturwissenschaft}}; the model is discussed in {{cite journal

*It seems natural that the possibility of time travel (existence of [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTCs)) makes hypercomputation possible by itself. However, this is not so since a CTC does not provide (by itself) the unbounded amount of storage that an infinite computation would require. Nevertheless, there are spacetimes in which the CTC region can be used for relativistic hypercomputation.&lt;ref&gt;Hajnal Andréka, István Németi and Gergely Székely, ''Closed Timelike Curves in Relativistic Computation'' Parallel Process.

===Quantum models===
Some scholars conjecture that a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system which somehow uses an infinite superposition of states could compute a non-[[computable function]].&lt;ref&gt;There have been some claims to this effect; see {{cite journal | author = Tien Kieu | title = Quantum Algorithm for the [[Hilbert problems|Hilbert's Tenth Problem]] | journal = Int. J. Theor. Phys. | year = 2003 | volume = 42 | arxiv = quant-ph/0110136 | pages = 1461–1478 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025780028846 | issue = 7}} or {{cite journal | author = M.

&lt;/ref&gt; This is not possible using the standard [[qubit]]-model [[quantum computer]], because it is proven that a regular quantum computer is [[PSPACE-reduction|PSPACE-reducible]] (a quantum computer running in [[polynomial time]] can be simulated by a classical computer running in [[polynomial space]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein and Vazirani, Quantum complexity theory, [[SIAM Journal on Computing]], 26(5):1411–1473, 1997.

==="Eventually correct" systems===
Some physically-realizable systems will always eventually converge to the correct answer, but have the defect that they will often output an incorrect answer and stick with the incorrect answer for an uncomputably large period of time before eventually going back and correcting the mistake.

*In mid 1960s, [[E Mark Gold]] and [[Hilary Putnam]] independently proposed models of [[inductive inference]] (the "limiting recursive functionals"&lt;ref name=LimRecurs&gt;{{cite journal | author=E. M. Gold | title=Limiting Recursion | journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=28–48 | year=1965 | jstor=2270580 | doi=10.2307/2270580}}, {{cite journal | author=E. Mark Gold | title=Language identification in the limit | journal=Information and Control | volume=10 | pages=447–474 | year=1967 | doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(67)91165-5 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "trial-and-error predicates",&lt;ref name=TrialError&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hilary Putnam | title=Trial and Error Predicates and the Solution to a Problem of Mostowksi | journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=49–57 | year=1965 | jstor=2270581 | doi=10.2307/2270581}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively). These models enable some nonrecursive sets of numbers or languages (including all [[recursively enumerable]] sets of languages) to be "learned in the limit"; whereas, by definition, only recursive sets of numbers or languages could be identified by a Turing machine. While the machine will stabilize to the correct answer on any learnable set in some finite time, it can only identify it as correct if it is recursive; otherwise, the correctness is established only by running the machine forever and noting that it never revises its answer. Putnam identified this new interpretation as the class of "empirical" predicates, stating: "if we always 'posit' that the most recently generated answer is correct, we will make a finite number of mistakes, but we will eventually get the correct answer. (Note, however, that even if we have gotten to the correct answer (the end of the finite sequence) we are never ''sure'' that we have the correct answer.)"&lt;ref name=TrialError/&gt; [[L. K. Schubert]]'s 1974 paper "Iterated Limiting Recursion and the Program Minimization Problem" &lt;ref name=IterLimRec&gt;{{cite journal| author=L. K. Schubert | title=Iterated Limiting Recursion and the Program Minimization Problem | journal=Journal of the ACM | volume=21 | issue=3 |date=July 1974 | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321832.321841 | doi=10.1145/321832.321841| pages=436–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the effects of iterating the limiting procedure; this allows any [[arithmetic hierarchy|arithmetic]] predicate to be computed. Schubert wrote, "Intuitively, iterated limiting identification might be regarded as higher-order inductive inference performed collectively by an ever-growing community of lower order inductive inference machines."
*A symbol sequence is ''computable in the limit'' if there is a finite, possibly non-halting program on a [[universal Turing machine]] that incrementally outputs every symbol of the sequence. This includes the dyadic expansion of π and of every other [[computable real]], but still excludes all noncomputable reals. Traditional Turing machines cannot edit their previous outputs; generalized Turing machines, as defined by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], can. He defines the constructively describable symbol sequences as those that have a finite, non-halting program running on a generalized Turing machine, such that any output symbol eventually converges; that is, it does not change any more after some finite initial time interval. Due to limitations first exhibited by [[Kurt Gödel]] (1931), it may be impossible to predict the convergence time itself by a halting program, otherwise the [[halting problem]] could be solved. Schmidhuber (&lt;ref name=genTuring2000&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]| year=2000 | title=Algorithmic Theories of Everything | pages=1–5 | volume=13 | issue=4 | journal=Sections  in: Hierarchies of generalized Kolmogorov   complexities and nonenumerable universal measures computable in the limit.

Generalized Turing machines can eventually converge to a correct solution of the halting problem by evaluating a [[Specker sequence]].

==Analysis of capabilities==
Many hypercomputation proposals amount to alternative ways to read an [[oracle machine|oracle]] or [[advice (complexity)|advice function]] embedded into an otherwise classical machine. Others allow access to some higher level of the [[arithmetic hierarchy]]. For example, supertasking Turing machines, under the usual assumptions, would be able to compute any predicate in the [[truth-table reduction|truth-table degree]] containing &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt;. Limiting-recursion, by contrast, can compute any predicate or function in the corresponding [[Turing degree]], which is known to be &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt;. Gold further showed that limiting partial recursion would allow the computation of precisely the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_2&lt;/math&gt; predicates.

refers to this subject as "a myth" and offers counter-arguments to the
physical realizability of hypercomputation. As for its theory, he argues against
the claims that this is a new field founded in the 1990s. This point of view relies
on the history of computability theory (degrees of unsolvability, computability over
functions, real numbers and ordinals), as also mentioned above.
In his argument he makes a remark that all of hypercomputation is little more than: "'' if non-computable inputs are permitted then non computable outputs are attainable.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.mfo.de/document/0304a/Report03_2003.pdf | author=Martin Davis | contribution=The Myth of Hypercomputation | editor=Alexandra Shlapentokh | title=Miniworkshop: Hilbert's Tenth Problem, Mazur's  Conjecture and Divisibility Sequences | publisher=Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach | series=MFO Report | volume=3 | pages=2 | date=Jan 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual cover''' is a usually negative term for sophisticated arguments provided by members of the intelligentsia to bolster a particular viewpoint, and thereby help it gain respectability. Usually the viewpoint is one that a supporter (e.g. a politician) leaned toward anyway, but needed arguments to help him justify to others. The implication is that the supporter is not really interested in the truth but is just looking for an excuse to hold a certain position. For instance, it has been alleged that [[free market economics]] serve as intellectual cover for a "predator state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mises.org/journals/scholar/MacKenzie15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers into the characteristics of minorities have been accused of providing intellectual cover for bigots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination|author=Nelson, Todd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Testament]] scholar [[Gerhard Kittel]] was accused of offering intellectual cover to the [[Nazi]]s' [[genocidal]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=99|number=4|date=Fall 2009|issn=1553-0604|author=Levenson, Alan T.|title=The Mismeasure of the Jew|publisher=Jewish Quarterly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kizzy: Mum at 14''''' was a [[BBC Three]] [[Documentary film|documentary]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008h3jl BBC Programmes Page for Kizzy: Mum at 14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7136196.stm|title=Pregnant at 13, mum at 14, GCSEs at 15|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date=10 December 2007|work=[[BBC Online|BBC News Magazine]]|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; about an [[Teenage pregnancy|underage mother]], Kizzy Kay Neal. It was first shown on 11 December 2007 as part of the fourth and final part of the Born Survivor series on [[BBC Three]]. Kizzy had [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] for the first time at the age of 13, and gave birth, at the age of 14 to a boy, whom she named Kaylib.

==Show and background==
The 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary highlights the UK's high [[teenage pregnancy]] rate and follows Kizzy after she leaves school for the summer holidays in 2007. Kizzy was born in [[Leicester]] in 1992, but lives in [[Torbay]]. Kizzy claims she got pregnant in a [[one night stand]] with a boy named Louie, whom Kizzy wants to accept responsibility for Kaylib. Louie has moved to [[Essex]] since Kizzy became pregnant.  Kizzy arranged to have herself and Kaylib baptised at [[Easter]] time, her reason being to give Kaylib a good start in life.

===Reaction of friends===
Kizzy tells the interviewers about mixed reactions from her friends. She says that when her friends found out she was pregnant they wanted babies too and, three weeks later, they were pregnant. Not all the reactions were positive. Her brothers talk about having abuse shouted at them and even being physically beaten on several occasions.

===Meeting with Louie===
At the end of documentary Kizzy, her mother, brothers and her boyfriend Michael travel up to Essex to see Louie. Louie would not allow Michael or her brothers at the meeting and would also not allow cameras. Kizzy stated that this was the first time Louie had met his son and it would probably be the last.

===Kizzy's future===
In September 2007, Kizzy was set to go back to school, but the school said that it would be better in all interests if she went to college. Kizzy aims to join the [[UK Youth Parliament]], with her political focus being on youth and [[sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2008/11/27/Teenage_mum_Kizzy_Neal_to_return_to_BBC_TV_in_new_film/ BBC 2008 new film]&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2011 Kizzy gave birth to her second child, a boy named Taylor.

The [[small molecule]] chemicals found in a given metabolome may include both endogenous [[metabolites]] that are naturally produced by an [[organism]] (such as [[amino acids]], [[organic acids]], [[nucleic acids]], [[fatty acids]], [[amines]], [[sugars]], [[vitamins]], [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factors]], [[pigments]], [[antibiotics]], etc.) as well as exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, [[environmental contaminant]]s, [[food additives]], [[toxins]] and other [[xenobiotics]]) that are not naturally produced by an organism.&lt;ref name=ref_17626065&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wishart|first=DS|title=Current progress in computational metabolomics|journal=Brief Bioinform.|date=September 2007|volume=8|issue=5|pages=279–93|pmid=17626065|doi=10.1093/bib/bbm030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref_16689529&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nordström|first=A|author2=O'Maille G |author3=Qin C |author4=Siuzdak G. |title=Nonlinear data alignment for UPLC-MS and HPLC-MS based metabolomics: quantitative analysis of endogenous and exogenous metabolites in human serum|journal=Anal.

The endogenous metabolome can be further subdivided to include a "primary" and a "secondary" metabolome (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A [[primary metabolite]] is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A [[secondary metabolite]] is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function.  [[Secondary metabolites]] may include [[pigments]], [[antibiotics]] or waste products derived from partially metabolized [[xenobiotics]]. To qualify as a [[metabolite]], or to be considered to be part of the metabolome, a [[small molecule]] must typically have a [[molecular weight]] &lt;1500 Da.&lt;ref name=ref_17626065 /&gt; This means that molecules such as [[glycolipids]], [[polysaccharides]], short [[peptides]] (&lt;14 amino acids) and small [[oligonucleotides]] (&lt;5 bases) can be regarded as [[metabolites]] or constituents of the metabolome. On the other hand, very large [[macromolecules]] such as [[proteins]], [[messenger RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], [[microRNA]] and [[DNA]] are definitely not [[metabolites]] and are not considered to be part of the metabolome. The study of the metabolome is called [[metabolomics]].

==Origins==
The word metabolome appears to be a blending of the words “[[metabolite]]” and “[[chromosome]]”. It was constructed to imply that [[metabolites]] are indirectly encoded by genes or act on genes and gene products.  The term “metabolome” was first used in 1998 &lt;ref name=ref_9744112 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref_9748443&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tweeddale|first=H|author2=Notley-McRobb L |author3=Ferenci T. |title=Effect of slow growth on metabolism of Escherichia coli, as revealed by global metabolite pool ("metabolome") analysis.|journal=J. Bacteriol.|date=Oct 1998|volume=180|issue=19|pages=5109–16|pmid=9748443|pmc=107546}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was likely coined to match with existing biological terms referring to the complete set of genes (the [[genome]]), the complete set of proteins (the [[proteome]]) and the complete set of transcripts (the [[transcriptome]]). The first book on [[metabolomics]] was published in 2003.&lt;ref name=book_Harrigan&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrigan, G. G. &amp; Goodacre, R.

==Measuring the metabolome==
The metabolome reflects the interaction between an organism’s genome and its environment.  As a result, an organism’s metabolome can serve as an excellent probe of its [[phenotype]] (i.e. the product of its [[genotype]] and its environment). [[Metabolites]] can be measured (identified, quantified or classified) using a number of different technologies including [[NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]].  Most [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) methods must be coupled to various forms of [[liquid chromatography]] (LC), [[gas chromatography]] (GC) or [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) to facilitate compound separation. Each method is typically able to identify or characterize 50-5000 different metabolites or metabolite “features” at a time, depending on the instrument or protocol being used. See Figure 2 for an illustration of the relationship between different analytical methods and their sensitivity.  Currently it is not possible to analyze the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.

[[NMR spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is an analytical chemistry technique that measures the absorption of [[radiofrequency]] radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong [[magnetic fields]].  The frequency (i.e. the [[chemical shift]]) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule.  The NMR absorption patterns produce “resonance” peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts – this collection of peaks is called a [[NMR spectrum]]. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) [[NMR spectrum]].  As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for “classical” metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR was one of the first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements.  As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization.  NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids or [[GC-MS]] analysis, such as large molecules (&gt;500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds.  NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 µM.  Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.

[[Mass spectrometry]] is an analytical technique that measures the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of molecules.  Molecules or molecular fragments are typically charged or ionized by spraying them through a charged field ([[electrospray ionization]]), bombarding them with electrons from a hot filament ([[electron ionization]]) or blasting them with a laser when they are placed on specially coated plates (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization).  The charged molecules are then propelled through space using electrodes or magnets and their speed, rate of curvature, or other physical characteristics are measured to determine their [[mass-to-charge ratio]].  From these data the mass of the parent molecule can be determined.  Further fragmentation of the molecule through controlled collisions with gas molecules or with electrons can help determine the structure of molecules. Very accurate mass measurements can also be used to determine the elemental formulas or elemental composition of compounds.  Most forms of mass spectrometry require some form of separation using [[liquid chromatography]] or [[gas chromatography]].  This separation step is required to simplify the resulting mass spectra and to permit more accurate compound identification.  Some [[mass spectrometry]] methods also require that the molecules be derivatized or chemically modified so that they are more amenable for [[chromatographic]] separation (this is particularly true for [[GC-MS]]).  As an analytical technique, MS is a very sensitive method that requires very little sample (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;ng of material or &lt;10 µL of a biofluid) and can generate signals for 1000s of metabolites from a single sample. MS instruments can also be configured for very high throughput metabolome analyses (100s to 1000s of samples a day).  Quantification of metabolites and the characterization of novel compound structures is more difficult by MS than by NMR. [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is particularly amenable to detecting hydrophobic molecules ([[lipids]], [[fatty acids]]) and [[peptides]] while [[GC-MS]] is best for detecting [[small molecules]] (&lt;500 Da) and highly volatile compounds ([[esters]], [[amines]], [[ketones]], [[alkanes]], [[thiols]]).

Unlike the [[genome]] or even the [[proteome]], the metabolome is a highly dynamic entity that can change dramatically, over a period of just seconds or minutes. As a result, there is growing interest in measuring metabolites over multiple time periods or over short time intervals using modified versions of NMR or MS-based metabolomics.

==Metabolome databases==
Because an organism’s metabolome is largely defined by its [[genome]], different species will have different metabolomes.  Indeed, the fact that the metabolome of a tomato is different than the metabolome of an apple is the reason why these two fruits taste so different.   Furthermore, different tissues, different [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[biofluids]] associated with those organs and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] can also have distinctly different metabolomes.  The fact that different organisms and different [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]/[[biofluids]] have such different metabolomes has led to the development of a number of organism-specific of biofluid-specific metabolome databases.

===The Human Metabolome Database===
The [[Human Metabolome Database]] is a freely available, open-access database containing detailed data on more than 40,000 metabolites that have already been identified or are likely to be found in the human body. The [[HMDB]] contains three kinds of information: 1) chemical information, 2) clinical information, and 3) biochemical information. The chemical data includes &gt;40,000 metabolite structures with detailed descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties.  It also contains nearly 10,000 experimentally measured [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra from more than 1100 different metabolites. The clinical information includes data on &gt;10,000 [[metabolite]]-[[biofluid]] concentrations, metabolite concentration information on more than 600 different human diseases and pathway data for more than 200 different inborn errors of metabolism. The biochemical information includes nearly 6000 protein (and DNA) sequences and more than 5000 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries.  The [[HMDB]] supports a wide variety of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are attempting to identify or understand metabolites in clinical metabolomic studies. The first version of the [[HMDB]] was released in Jan. 1 2007 and was compiled by scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. At that time they reported data on 2,500 [[metabolites]], 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Since then these scientists have greatly expanded the collection. The latest version of the [[HMDB]] (version 3.5) contains &gt;16,000 endogenous metabolites, &gt;1500 drugs and &gt;22,000 food constituents or food metabolites.&lt;ref name=ref_23161693&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wishart DS, Jewison T, Guo AC, Wilson M, Knox C, Liu Y, Djoumbou Y, Mandal R, Aziat F, Dong E, Bouatra S, Sinelnikov I, Arndt D, Xia J, Liu P, Yallou F, Bjorndahl T, Perez-Pineiro R, Eisner R, Allen F, Neveu V, Greiner R, Scalbert A |title=HMDB 3.0--The Human Metabolome Database in 2013|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=41|issue=Database issue|pages=D801–7|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1065|pmid=23161693|pmc=3531200|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human biofluid metabolomes====
Scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] have been systematically characterizing specific biofluid metabolomes including the serum metabolome,&lt;ref name="ref_21359215" /&gt; the urine metabolome,&lt;ref name="ref_24023812" /&gt; the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) metabolome &lt;ref name="ref_22546835" /&gt; and the saliva metabolome.  These efforts have involved both experimental metabolomic analysis (involving [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]], [[ICP-MS]], [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] and [[HPLC]] assays) as well as extensive literature mining.  According to their data, the human serum metabolome contains at least 4200 different compounds (including many lipids), the human urine metabolome contains at least 3000 different compounds (including 100s of volatiles and gut microbial metabolites), the human [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] metabolome contains nearly 500 different compounds while the human saliva metabolome contains approximately 400 different metabolites, including many bacterial products.

===Yeast Metabolome Database===
The [[Yeast Metabolome Database]] is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2000 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] ([[Baker’s yeast]]). The [[YMDB]] contains two kinds of information: 1) chemical information and 2) biochemical information. The chemical information in YMDB includes 2027 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties. It also contains nearly 4000 [[NMR]], [[GC-MS]] and [[LC/MS]] spectra obtained from more than 500 different metabolites. The biochemical information in [[YMDB]] includes &gt;1100 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;900 biochemical reactions. The [[YMDB]] supports a wide variety of queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying yeast as a model organism or who are looking into optimizing the production of fermented beverages (wine, beer).

===The Escherichia coli Metabolome Database===
The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database]] is a freely accessible, online database of &gt;2700 small molecule metabolites found in or produced by [[Escherichia coli]] (E. coli strain K12, MG1655).  The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database|ECMDB]] contains two kinds of information: 1) chemical information and 2) biochemical information. The chemical information includes more than 2700 metabolite structures with detailed metabolite descriptions, extensive chemical classifications, synthesis information and observed/calculated chemical properties.  It also contains nearly 5000 [[NMR]], [[GC/MS|GC-MS]] and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] spectra from more than 600 different metabolites. The biochemical information includes &gt;1600 protein (and DNA) sequences and &gt;3100 biochemical reactions that are linked to these metabolite entries. The [[E. Coli Metabolome Database|ECMDB]] supports many different types of online queries including text searches, chemical structure searches, sequence similarity searches and spectral similarity searches.  This makes it particularly useful for metabolomic researchers who are studying [[E. coli]] as a model organism.

'''Metalinguistics''' is the branch of [[linguistics]] that studies [[language]] and its relationship to other [[culture|cultural behavior]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} It is the study of dialogue relationships between units of speech communication as manifestations and enactments of co-existence.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} [[Jacob L. Mey]] in his book, ''Trends in Linguistics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfyF9W6xiMC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ei=qb2wS6j8Ho20MN3eraYM&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=When Voices Clash: A Study in Literary Pragmatics|author=Jacob L. Mey |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s interpretation of metalinguistics as "encompassing the life history of a speech community, with an orientation toward a study of large events in the speech life of people and embody changes in various cultures and ages."


==Definitions==

Jean-Émile Gombert, teaching genetic psychology at Dijon University, France, states that one thing is to find an adequate way to treat the comprehension and the production of language, and another is to successfully adopt a reflexive attitude regarding the language objects and their manipulation. This is the second time that a psycholinguistic tradition recently developed has been given the name metalinguistics.

The linguist Noam Chomsky defines the field of metalinguistics as the subject knowledge of the characteristics and the operation of language or, from a more functionalist perspective, of its structure, its operation and its use. The relevant psychological description cannot be based on abstraction, it requires that the researchers and theorists widen their scopes till the point they can embrace the importance of the behavioural actions in the cognitive context of the subjects that realise them. The French linguist [[Jules Gilliéron]] wrote that ''All consciousness is necessarily 'meta' from the vantage point of the beholder, as it is not based on the real, but on its intelligibility of the real''.

==Literacy development==
Metalinguistic skills involve amplified and logical understanding of the rules used to govern language. Scholar Patrick Hartwell points out how substantial it is for students to develop these capabilities, especially heightened [[phonological awareness]], which is a key precursor to literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/376562|title=Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar|author=Patrick Hartwell|publisher=College English|volume=47|date=February 1985|pages=105–127|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essential aspect to language development is focused on the student being aware of language and the components of language.

This idea is also examined in the article, 'Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED391147&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED391147 |title=Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages. Technical Report No. 618|author1=Nagy, William E.|author2=Anderson, Richard C.|publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date=1964-05-15 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centers on how the construction of a language and writing strategy shape an individual's ability to read. It also discusses the manner in which bilingualism increases particular elements of metalinguistic awareness.

Published research studies by Elizabeth McAllister have concluded that metalinguistic abilities are associated to cognitive development and is contingent on metalinguistic awareness which relates to reading skill level, academic success and cultural environment that starts at infancy and continues through preschool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED308489&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED308489 |title=The Literacy of Metalinguistic Awareness|date=1989|author=McAllister, Elizabeth|publisher=Eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Text in Education and Society'', some examples of metalinguistic skills include discussing, examining, thinking about language, grammar and reading comprehension. The text also states that a student's recognition or self-correction of language in verbal and written form helps them further advance their skills. The book also illustrates manners in which literature can form connections or create boundaries between educational intelligence and practical knowledge.

Gail T. Gillion wrote the book, ''Phonological Awareness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDWymkbfP30C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Metalinguistics+awareness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RiL7T5XJu2&amp;sig=wAewxCdualj97xznyWOgxhJshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MImxS-zkOYaKNPWLvKME&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Metalinguistics%20awareness&amp;f=false |title=Phonological Awareness: From Research to Practice|author=Gail T. Gillon|date=2004 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrates the connection between phonological awareness and metalinguistic awareness's in literacy learning. It essentially states that a student's ability to understand the spoken word and their ability to recognize a word and decode it are dependent on each other. The text also discusses ways in which students struggling with speech impairments and reading difficulties can improve their learning process.

==In linguistics==
[[Linguists]] use this term to designate activities associated with ''[[metalanguage]]'', a language composed of the entirety of words forming linguistic terminology (for example, [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[phoneme]], [[lexeme]]... as well as terms in more current usage, such as word, sentence, letter, etc.) Metalinguistics is used to refer to the language, whether natural or formalized (as in [[logic]]), which is itself used to speak of language; to a language whose sole function is to describe a language.  The language itself must constitute the sole sphere of application for the entire vocabulary.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TMuhVO7LBdAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=YAATKdlPLa&amp;sig=W2K52EEyrK6GnmtQxQnAf3G0-BE#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=true |title=Metalinguistic Development |author=Jean Émile Gombert|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1992|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Experts are undecided about the value of awareness of metalanguage to language learners, and some "schools of thought" in language learning have been heavily against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalinguistic awareness and bilingualism==
[[Metalinguistic awareness]]  refers to the understanding that language is a system of communication, bound to rules, and forms the basis for the ability to discuss different ways to use language (Baten, Hofman, &amp; Loeys, 2011). In other words, it is the ability to consciously analyze language and its sub-parts, to know how they operate and how they are incorporated into the wider language system (Beceren, 2010). An individual with such ability is aware that linguistic forms and structure can interact and be manipulated to produce a vast variety of meanings. Words are only arbitrarily and symbolically associated with their referents, and are separable from them. For example, a dog is named "Cat", but the word "Cat" is only a representation for the animal, dog. It does not make the dog a cat.

The term was first used by Harvard professor Courtney Cazden in 1974 to demonstrate the shift of linguistic intelligence  across languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} Metalinguistic awareness in [[bilingual]] learners is the ability to objectively function outside one language system and to objectify languages’ rules, structures and functions. [[Code-switching]] and translation are examples of bilinguals’ metalinguistic awareness. Metalinguistics awareness was used as a construct in research extensively in the mid 1980s and early 1990s.
 
Metalinguistic awareness is a theme that has frequently appeared in the study of bilingualism. It can be divided into four subcategories, namely phonological, word, syntactic and pragmatic awareness (Tunmer, Herriman, &amp; Nesdale, 1988). Amongst the four, phonological and word awareness are the two aspects of metalinguistic awareness that have garnered the greatest attention in bilingual literacy research. Research has shown metalinguistic awareness in bilinguals to be a crucial component because of its documented relationship and positive effects on language ability, symbolic development and literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225082333/http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many studies investigating the impact of bilingualism on phonological and word awareness have indicated a positive bilingual effect (Baten, et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2004; Goetz, 2003; Kang, 2010; Ransdell, Barbier, &amp; Niit, 2006; Whitehurst &amp; Lonigan, 1998). Bilinguals are simultaneously learning and switching between two languages, which may facilitate the development of stronger phonological awareness. It is postulated that bilinguals’ experiences of acquiring and maintaining two different languages aid them in developing an explicit and articulated understanding of how language works (Adesope, Lavin, Thompson, &amp; Ungerleider, 2010). Hence they are equipped with stronger metalinguistic awareness as compared to their monolingual counterparts.

In their book ''Literacy and Orality'',&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VKSIC5H8sd8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=roD1IxtB-e&amp;sig=oWlgDG1nC_elQbjBs9kxB_IZgbc#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=Literacy and Orality|author1=Olson, David R.|author2=Torrance, Nancy |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1991-07-26 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scholars David R. Olson and Nancy Torrance explore the relationship between literacy and metalinguistic awareness, citing a link that arises from the fact that, in both reading and writing, language can become the object of thought and discussion.  Prose reading and writing can be an instrument of metalinguistic reflection and in those cases one must assess the particular meaning of terms and of grammatical relations between them in order, either to understand such texts or write them.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1083">In [[physics]], a '''non-Gaussianity''' is the correction that modifies the expected [[Gaussian function]] estimate for the [[measurement]] of a [[physical quantity]].

In [[physical cosmology]], the fluctuations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] are known to be approximately Gaussian, both theoretically as well as experimentally. However, most theories predict some level of non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field. Detection of these non-Gaussian signatures will allow discrimination between various models of inflation and their alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Bang Secrets Swirling in a Fluid Universe|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-bang-secrets-swirling-in-a-fluid-universe/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open-source  security''' is the measure of assurance or guarantee in the freedom from danger and risk inherent to an [[open-source software]] system.

==Implementation debate==
===Benefits===
* [[Proprietary software]] forces the user to accept the level of security that the software vendor is willing to deliver and to accept the rate that patches and updates are released.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, C. (January 2003). Software Security for Open-Source Systems. IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, 38–45. Retrieved 5 May 2008, from IEEE Computer Society Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is assumed that any compiler that is used creates code that can be trusted, but it has been demonstrated by [[Ken Thompson]] that a compiler can be subverted using an eponymous [[Backdoor (computing)#Reflections on Trusting Trust|''Thompson hack'']] to create faulty executables that are unwittingly produced by a well-intentioned developer.&lt;ref name="Witten"&gt;Witten, B., Landwehr, C., &amp; Caloyannides, M. (2001, September/October). Does Open Source Improve System Security? ''IEEE Software'', 57–61. Retrieved 5 May 2008, from Computer Database.&lt;/ref&gt; With access to the source code for the compiler, the developer has at least the ability to discover if there is any mal-intention.
** [[David A. Wheeler]] demonstrates that the existence of two different open-source self-compiling compilers (which should be able to compile each other) can be used to establish a binary for one of them that is known not to be subverted by the Thompson hack.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;Wheeler, David A.  Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] is based on the idea that an enemy can steal a secure military system and not be able to compromise the information. His ideas were the basis for many modern security practices, and followed that [[security through obscurity]] is a bad practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hoepman, J.-H., &amp; Jacobs, B. (2007). Increased Security Through Open Source. Communications of the ACM , 50 (1), 79–83. Retrieved 5 May 2008, from ACM Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===
* Simply making source code available does not guarantee review. An example of this occurring is when [[Marcus J. Ranum|Marcus Ranum]], an expert on security system design and implementation, released his first public firewall toolkit. At one time, there were over 2,000 sites using his toolkit, but only 10 people gave him any feedback or patches.&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, G. (March 2002). Open Source Security: Opportunity or Oxymoron? Computer , 18–21.  Retrieved 5 May 2008, from IEEE Computer Society Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Having a large amount of eyes reviewing code can "lull a user into a false sense of security".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M., Köhntopp, K., &amp; Pfitzmann, A. (2002). The Open Source approach – opportunities and limitations with respect to security and privacy. Computers &amp; Security , 21 (5), 461–471.  Retrieved 5 May 2008, from Computer Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Having many users look at source code does not guarantee that security flaws will be found and fixed.

==Metrics and models==
There are a variety of models and metrics to measure the security of a system.  These are a few methods that can be used to measure the security of software systems.

===Number of days between vulnerabilities===
It is argued that a system is most vulnerable after a potential vulnerability is discovered, but before a patch is created.  By measuring the number of days between the vulnerability and when the vulnerability is fixed, a basis can be determined on the security of the system.  There are a few caveats to such an approach: not every vulnerability is equally bad, and fixing a lot of bugs quickly might not be better than only finding a few and taking a little bit longer to fix them, taking into account the operating system, or the effectiveness of the fix.&lt;ref name="Witten" /&gt;

===Poisson process===
The [[Poisson process]] can be used to measure the rates at which different people find security flaws between open and closed source software. The process can be broken down by the number of volunteers N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; and paid reviewers N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The rates at which volunteers find a flaw is measured by λ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; and the rate that paid reviewers find a flaw is measured by λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The expected time that a volunteer group is expected to find a flaw is 1/(N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and the expected time that a paid group is expected to find a flaw is 1/(N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Witten" /&gt;

===Morningstar model===
By comparing a large variety of open source and closed source projects a star system could be used to analyze the security of the project similar to how [[Morningstar, Inc.]] rates mutual funds. With a large enough data set, statistics could be used to measure the overall effectiveness of one group over the other. An example of such as system is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, G. (6 May 2008). [http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/security_metrics/index.html Stalking the right software security metric]. Retrieved 18 May 2008, from Raindrop.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 Star:  Many security vulnerabilities.
* 2 Stars:  Reliability issues.
* 3 Stars:  Follows best security practices.
* 4 Stars:  Documented secure development process.
* 5 Stars:  Passed independent security review.

===Coverity scan===
[[Coverity]] in collaboration with Stanford University has established a new baseline for open-source quality and security. The development is being completed through a contract with the Department of Homeland Security. They are utilizing innovations in automated defect detection to identify critical types of bugs found in software.&lt;ref name="CoverityIndex"&gt;Coverity. (n.d.). [http://scan.coverity.com/index.html Accelerating Open Source Quality]. Retrieved 18 May 2008, from Scan.Coverity.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of quality and security is measured in rungs.  Rungs do not have a definitive meaning, and can change as Coverity releases new tools.  Rungs are based on the progress of fixing issues found by the Coverity Analysis results and the degree of collaboration with Coverity.&lt;ref name="CoverityLadder"&gt;Coverity. (n.d.). [http://scan.coverity.com/ladder.html Scan Ladder FAQ]. Retrieved 18 May 2008, from Scan.Coverity.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  They start with Rung 0 and currently go up to Rung 2.
* '''Rung 0'''
The project has been analyzed by Coverity’s Scan infrastructure, but no representatives from the open-source software have come forward for the results.&lt;ref name="CoverityLadder" /&gt;
* '''Rung 1'''
At rung 1, there is collaboration between Coverity and the development team.  The software is analyzed with a subset of the scanning features to prevent the development team from being overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="CoverityLadder" /&gt;
* '''Rung 2'''
There are 11 projects that have been analyzed and upgraded to the status of Rung 2 by reaching zero defects in the first year of the scan.  These projects include: AMANDA, [[Network Time Protocol#Unix|ntp]], [[OpenPAM]], [[OpenVPN]], Overdose, [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Samba (software)|Samba]], and [[tcl]].&lt;ref name="CoverityLadder" /&gt;

'''Overgrazing''' occurs when plants are exposed to intensive [[grazing]] for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either [[livestock]] in poorly managed [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications, [[game reserve]]s, or [[nature reserve]]s. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] or [[Introduced species|non-native]] [[Wildlife|wild animals]]. Cows are the main things that causes overgrazing and "overgrazing". However, "overgrazing" is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory. 

It reduces the usefulness, [[primary productivity|productivity]], and [[biodiversity]] of the land and is one cause of [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of [[invasive species]] of [[invasive plant|non-native plants]] and of [[weed]]s. It is  caused by nomadic [[grazing|grazers]] in huge populations of travel [[herd]]s, such as the American bison of the Great Plains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laduke |first=Winona |date=1999 |title=All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life |url=http://zinelibrary.info/files/All_Our_Relations.pdf |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=South End Press |page=146 |isbn=0896085996 |access-date=30 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112803/http://zinelibrary.info/files/All_Our_Relations.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke University"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |title=Bison Conservation: Saving an Ecologically and Culturally Keystone Species |last1=Duval |first1=Clay |publisher=Duke University |access-date=April 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308011257/http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or migratory [[Wildebeest]]s of the African [[savanna]]s,&lt;ref&gt;In [[Predator–prey equations|balance]] with, and accompanied by, prides of [[Keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]].&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic]] planned grazing.&lt;ref name="Forbes-AS"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2012/12/20/holistic-land-management-key-to-global-stability/ "Holistic Land Management: Key to Global Stability"] by Terry Waghorn.

[[sustainable agriculture|Sustainable grassland production]] is based on [[grass]] and grassland management, [[land management]], animal management and livestock marketing. Grazing management, with [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[agroecology]] practices, is the foundation of grassland-based livestock production since it affects both animal and plant health and productivity. There are several new grazing models and management systems that attempt to reduce or eliminate overgrazing like [[Holistic management]]&lt;ref name=TED-Talk-Allan-Savory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|title=How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI|website=youtube.com|publisher=TED|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YT-ASavory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|title=Can sheep save the planet?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUMQVqtjUAQ|website=youtube.com|publisher=IWTOCHANNEL|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Permaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/forglvst/overgraz.htm West Virginia University Extension Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423103409/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/forglvst/overgraz.htm |date=2009-04-23 }} Overgrazing Can Hurt Environment, Your Pocketbook Ed Rayburn. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-AS" /&gt;

== Indicators ==
One indicator of overgrazing is that the animals run short of pasture. In some regions of the United States under continuous grazing, overgrazed pastures are predominated by short-grass species such as [[Poa|bluegrass]] and will be less than 2-3&amp;nbsp;inches tall in the grazed areas. In other parts of the world, overgrazed pasture is typically taller than sustainably grazed pasture, with grass heights typically over 1 meter and dominated by unpalatable species such as ''[[Aristida]]'' or ''[[Imperata]]''. In all cases, palatable tall grasses such as [[orchard grass]] are sparse or non-existent. In such cases of overgrazing, soil may be visible between plants in the stand, allowing erosion to occur, though in many circumstances overgrazed pastures have a greater sward cover than sustainably grazed pastures.

=== Rotational grazing ===
Under rotational grazing, overgrazed plants do not have enough time to recover to the proper height between grazing events. The animals resume grazing before the plants have restored carbohydrate reserves and grown back roots lost after the last [[defoliation]]. The result is the same as under continuous grazing: in some parts of the United States tall-growing species die and short-growing species that are more subject to drought injury predominate the pasture, while in most other parts of the world tall, drought tolerant, unpalatable species such as ''[[Imperata]]'' or ''[[Aristida]]'' come to dominate. As the sod thins, weeds encroach into the pasture in some parts of the [[United States]], whereas in most other parts of the worlds overgrazing can promote thick swards of native unpalatable grasses that hamper the spread of weeds.

Another indicator of overgrazing in some parts of [[North America]] is that livestock run out of pasture, and hay needs to be fed early in the fall. In contrast, most areas of the world do not experience the same climatic regime as the continental United States and hay feeding is rarely conducted.

Overgrazing is also indicated in livestock performance and condition. Cows having inadequate pasture immediately following their [[calf (animal)|calf]]'s [[weaning]] may have poor body condition the following season. This may reduce the health and vigor of cows and calves at [[Birth|calving]]. Also, cows in poor body condition do not cycle as soon after calving, which can result in delayed breeding. This can result in a long calving season. With good cow genetics, nutrition, ideal seasons and controlled breeding 55% to 75% of the calves should come in the first 21 days of the calving season. Poor weaning weights of calves can be caused by insufficient pasture, when cows give less milk and the calves need pasture to maintain weight gain.

==Ecological impacts==
{{see|land degradation}}
Overgrazing typically increases [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overgrazing Overgrazing]. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduction in soil depth, [[soil organic matter]] and soil fertility impair the land's future natural and agricultural productivity.  Soil fertility can sometimes be mitigated by applying the appropriate lime and [[organic fertilizer]]s. However, the loss of soil depth and organic matter takes centuries to correct. Their loss is critical in determining the soil's water-holding capacity and how well pasture plants do during dry weather.

[[Native plant]] [[grass]] species, both individual [[bunch grass]]es and in [[grassland]]s, are especially vulnerable.

== North America==
In the [[continental United States]], to prevent overgrazing, match the forage supplement to the herd's requirement.  This means that a buffer needs to be in the system to adjust for the fastest growth of forages.

Another potential buffer is to plant warm-season perennial grasses such as [[switchgrass]], which do not grow early in the season.  This reduces the area that the livestock can use early in the season, making it easier for them to keep up with the cool-season grasses.  The animals then use the warm-season grasses during the heat of the summer, and the cool-season grasses recover for fall grazing.

The grazing guidelines in the table are for rotationally grazed, cool-season forages.  When using continuous grazing, manage pasture height at one-half the recommended turn-in height for rotational grazing to optimize plant health. The growth habit of some forage species, such as [[alfalfa]], does not permit their survival under continuous grazing.  When managing for legumes in the stand, it is beneficial to use rotational grazing and graze the stand close and then give adequate rest to stimulate the legumes' growth.

==Economic theory==
{{main|Common land}}
Overgrazing is used as an example in the economic concept now known as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]] devised in a 1968 paper by [[Garrett Hardin]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243-1248.

Hardin's example could only apply to unregulated use of land regarded as a common resource.

Normally, rights of use of Common land in England and Wales were, and still are, closely regulated, and available only to "commoners". If excessive use was made of common land, for example in overgrazing, a common would be "stinted", that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure; thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. This important part of actual historic practice was absent from the economic model of Hardin.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" Journal of Environmental Ethics, Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt;
In reality the use of common land in England and Wales was a triumph of conserving a scarce resource using agreed custom and practice.

Overgrazing does not necessarily mean total [[denudation]] of the land. Overgrazing can also occur with native species. In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Australia]] the local government, in 2013, authorised the culling of 1455 [[kangaroos]] due to overgrazing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">'''Peter Stephen Berg''' (October 1, 1937&amp;nbsp;– July 28, 2011) was an environmental writer, best known as an advocate of the concept of [[bioregionalism]].  In the early 1960s, he was a member of the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]].  He is the founder of the Planet Drum Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Clifton (2009). Saving the Environment: Five Creative Approaches. ''Futurist'', 43 (2): 48-51. {{issn|0016-3317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Jamaica, Queens]], New York, Berg was raised in Florida where he first became interested in the environment as a child.  He later studied psychology at the University of Florida and enlisted in the army.  After his discharge, he moved back to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty, C. (2014). Peter Berg: Living a Making. In C. Glotfelty &amp; E. Quesnel (Eds.), ''The Biosphere and the Bioregion: Essential Writings of Peter Berg'' (pp. 228-247). Routledge. {{ISBN|1134504098}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioregionalism==
Peter Berg defined the concept of bioregionalism as "a geographic area defined by natural characteristics, including watersheds, landforms, soils, geological qualities, native plants and animals, climate, and weather...[which] includes human beings as a species in the interplay of these natural characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Ewert, Sara Dant (2002). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20615277 Bioregional Politics: The Case for Place]. ''Oregon Historical Quarterly'', 103 (4): 439-451. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After suffering from lung cancer, he died from pneumonia in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitt, Robert (August 14, 2011).

{{main|History of Princeton University}}
[[File:US 1956 3c Nassau Hall.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative 3-cent stamp from 1956 celebrating the bicentennial of [[Nassau Hall]]]]

[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 in order to train ministers.&lt;ref name = Princeton&gt;{{cite web | title = Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url= http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description |work= Library Finding Aids|publisher= Princeton University |accessdate= 11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish Presbyterian America. In 1754, trustees of the College of New Jersey suggested that, in recognition of Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]]'s interest, Princeton should be named as Belcher College. Belcher replied: "[[belching|What a name]] that would be!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=1933 |page=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhJbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=jonathan+belcher++++princeton++what+the+hell+of&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_0vYwy0gtt&amp;sig=6_AUl6-04_GJUFx8PIDz3_R7hDU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI7NO0-KC9xwIVAx8eCh0Yfwbj#v=onepage&amp;q=jonathan%20belcher%20%20%20%20princeton%20%20what%20the%20hell%20of&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became president in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jeffry H | last = Morrison | title = John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |authorlink=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=0-691-01122-2 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|page=24|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the [[United States capital|country's capital]] for four months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin [[lion sculpture]]s that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall/&gt; Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.&lt;ref name="apc-nassau-hall" /&gt;

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = McCosh, James|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|pages = |url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html|oclc = 4193433|work = A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McCosh Hall is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt;

In 1879, the first thesis for a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] Ph.D. was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=April|title=When Did the College of New Jersey Change to Princeton University?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/07/when-did-the-college-of-new-jersey-change-to-princeton-university/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university.

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]], graduate of the Class of 1879, was elected the 13th president of the university.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Under Wilson, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the US that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

This helped start an incorrect impression that it was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study "critical languages" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by Sally Frank, [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Associated Press | title = Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1991 | page = A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1987-03-01 | title = Princeton song goes coed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-11, Princeton professor [[Nannerl O.

===Cannon Green===

[[File:Cannon Green Princeton c1909.jpg|thumb|Cannon Green ca. 1909, with East Pyne, Whig and Clio Halls]]

Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the "Big Cannon," which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was taken to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

A second "Little Cannon" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions|volume=2|year=1879|edition=2nd|publisher=J.

Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the "New New Quad") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including "waffle ceilings", the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Princeton Companion|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|chapter = West, Andrew Fleming|oclc = 4193433|chapter-url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html}}{{Self-published inline|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls.

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090#.VGSgkJOsUk8 |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's "Constructed Utopia" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |publisher=The New England Quarterly | date= June 2011 | accessdate =November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated1" /&gt; The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue, fall show, and Reunions performances in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the United States.

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}

[[File:Art Museum Princeton.JPG|thumb|left|The Art Museum]]

The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 92,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

The [[Princeton University Chapel]] is located on the north side of campus, near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928, at a cost of $2.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_univchapel.html |first=Sara |last=Bush |title=The University Chapel |publisher=Princeton University | accessdate =Jun 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately ${{inflation|US|2.3|1928|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars.

==Demographics==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
In 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other [[Ivy League]] schools. Sixteen percent of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. Caroline C. Pam of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that Princeton was "long dogged by a reputation for [[anti-Semitism]]" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish&gt;{{cite web|author=Pam, Caroline C.|url=http://observer.com/1999/05/enrollment-of-jews-at-princeton-drops-by-40-percent-in-15-years/|title=Enrollment of Jews at Princeton Drops by 40 Percent in 15 Years|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|date=1999-05-31|accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time many Jewish students at Princeton dated Jewish students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] because they perceived Princeton as an environment where it was difficult to find romantic prospects; Pam stated that there was a theory that the dating issues were a cause of the decline in Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish/&gt;

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of $22.15 billion, Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university had the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over $2 million for undergraduates) in 2011.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news |title = Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student|year = 2011|work = CNBC.com|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130531100005/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-date = May 31, 2013 |others = Praefcke, Andreas (photo credit)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |title = Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion|work = [[Dly.

==Academics==

[[File:University Library, Princeton University-LCCN2008679653.tif|thumb|left|East Pyne Hall, home to several departments in the [[humanities]], in a 1903 photo when it served as the University library]]

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. [[Doctorate|Doctoral education]] is available in most disciplines.&lt;ref name="degree programs"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/|title = Departments &amp; Programs|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|date = October 1, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===

[[File:McCosh 50 (front).jpg|thumb|McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus]]

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/|title = About Us|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|at = Role of Honor Committee|website = Honor Committee|date = May 19, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|title = Honor Code|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = June 1, 2011 |website = The Student Guide to Princeton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074938/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|archivedate = June 15, 2010}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}} {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68|title = Honor Code|type = YouTube video|year = 2008|others = music and lyrics by Peter Mills|access-date = October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|title = Committee on Discipline|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|website = ODUS: Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students|date = August 25, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103152504/http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/sources/|title = Acknowledging Your Sources|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|date = August 2011|website = Academic Integrity}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 6.1% of undergraduate applicants in the 2016-2017 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2021).&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;  The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores were 690-790 for critical reading, 710-800 for math, and 700-790 for writing.&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;  The middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Composite score was 32-35.&lt;ref name=CDS/&gt;

In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, effectively ending the school's [[early decision]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/86/07G08/|title = Princeton to end early admission|date = September 18, 2006|accessdate = October 25, 2015|publisher = Princeton University}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, following decisions by the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University]] to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute an [[early action]] program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S29/85/15K32/index.xml|title = Princeton to reinstate early admission program|date = February 24, 2011|accessdate = October 25, 2015 |publisher = Princeton University}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[American City Business Journals|''The Business Journal'']] rated Princeton as the most selective college in the Eastern United States in terms of admission selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/12/princeton-is-most-selective-college-in.html|title = Princeton is the most selective college in the Eastern US|publisher = [[Bus.

====Grade deflation policy====
[[File:Einstein_classroom.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Room 302 is a lecture hall at [[Frist Campus Center]] restored to its condition when [[Albert Einstein]] taught there]]

In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|publisher=''The Daily Princetonian''|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1277406249-7I3hc765HdqNtR0HmzFjDw|work=New York Times|title=In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|accessdate=June 24, 2010 | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakadesuyo.com/does-obvious-grade-inflation-hurt-students|publisher=Barking up the wrong tree|title=Does Obvious Grade Inflation Hurt Students|year=2010|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped down at the end of the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, a faculty committee tasked by Dean of the College [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]] to review the effectiveness of grade deflation found not only that the 35% target was both often misinterpreted as a hard quota and applied inconsistently across departments, but also that grades had begun to decline in 2003, the year before the policy was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=No more A quotas: Faculty committee recommends Princeton University change its grading policy |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/08/no_more_a_quotas_faculty_committee_recommends_princeton_university_change_its_grading_policy.html|accessdate=5 June 2015 |work=nj.com|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|title=Princeton University - Valerie Smith appointed president of Swarthmore College|website=www.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316001345/http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|archivedate=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee concluded that the observed lower grades since 2003 were the result of discussions and increased awareness during and since the implementation of the deflation policy, and not the deflation targets themselves, so recommended removing the numerical targets while charging individual departments with developing consistent standards for grading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report from the Ad Hoc Committee to Review Policies Regarding Assessment and Grading |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S40/73/33I92/PU_Grading_Policy_Report_2014_Aug.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed as recommended by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windemuth|first1=Anna|title=After faculty vote, grade deflation policy officially dead |url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/10/breaking-after-faculty-vote-grade-deflation-policy-officially-dead/|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=The Daily Princetonian|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate===

The [[Princeton University Graduate School|Graduate School]] has about 2,600 students in 42 academic departments and programs in social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. These departments include the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]], [[Princeton University Department of History|Department of History]], and [[Princeton University Department of Economics|Department of Economics]].

In 2017-8, it received nearly 11,000 applications for admission and accepted around 1,000 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Admission Statistics|url=https://gradschool.princeton.edu/about/statistics/admission-statistics|website=Princeton University|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University also awarded 319 Ph.D. degrees and 170 final master's degrees. Princeton has no [[medical school]], [[law school]], [[business school]], or [[school of education]]. (A short-lived [[Princeton Law School]] folded in 1852.) It offers professional graduate degrees in architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy, the last through the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and U.S. President) [[Woodrow Wilson]].

University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98% of students live on campus in dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193259/http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 17, 2008 |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321211627/http://www.pmunc.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 21, 2005|title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall for high school students and PDI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonirc.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=June 25, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820185207/http://www.picsim.org/|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The four-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826131543/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."

==Athletics==

[[File:Princeton University Cleo tiger.jpg|thumb|left]]

Princeton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides "a variety of physical education and recreational programs" for members of the Princeton community. According to the athletics program's mission statement, Princeton aims for its students who participate in athletics to be "'student athletes' in the fullest sense of the phrase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |title = Princeton University Mission Statement |accessdate = Jun 1, 2011 |author = Princeton Athletic Communications |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111223084238/http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |archivedate = December 23, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/athletics/ |title=Athletics &amp; Fitness |accessdate= Jun 1, 2011 | publisher = Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as ''Tigers'', and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/09/11/18534/ |title=Mascot revamped but still 'The Tiger' | first =Esther | last = Breger |date=Sep 11, 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian | accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball program]] is noted for its success under [[Pete Carril]], the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nba.com/coachfile/pete_carril/ |title= Pete Carril |publisher=NBA |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril introduced the [[Princeton offense]], an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.&lt;ref name= carril-nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Carril Is Yoda to Notion of Perpetual Motion | first =John | last = Branch |newspaper=The New York Times |date= Mar 30, 2007 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30carril.html |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat [[UCLA]], the defending national champion, in the opening round of the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 NCAA tournament]],&lt;ref name = carril-nyt /&gt; in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/ncaatourneyupset.html | title= When underdogs dance | publisher = ESPN | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against [[Monmouth University]] on Dec 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap/_/id/253480163/monmouth-hawks-vs-princeton-tigers | title = Princeton loses lowest-scoring D-I game since 3-point line | agency = Associated Press | publisher = ESPN |date=Dec 15, 2005 | accessdate =Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men's [[water polo]] team is currently a dominant force in the Collegiate Water Polo Association, having reached the [[Final Four]] in two of the last three years. Similarly, the [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse program]] enjoyed a period of dominance 1992–2001, during which time it won six national championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usila.org/NCAAChampionHistory.htm |title=The NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship, formerly known as the Wingate Memorial Champion | publisher= US Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club and intramural===

[[File:Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893.jpg|thumb|Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893]]

In addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts about 35 club sports teams.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; [[Princeton Rugby|Princeton's rugby team]] is organized as a club sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Princeton's oldest clubs flourishes | first =Ben | last = Laguna |date=Apr 3, 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/03/20695/ |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, nearly 300 teams participate in intramural sports at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222000136/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 22, 2007 |title = The Student Guide to Princeton: Intramurals |publisher = Princeton University |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intramurals are open to members of Princeton's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential college or eating club must consist only of members of that college or club. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |title=General Information |publisher=Princeton University Campus Recreation |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301120351/http://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |archivedate=March 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games is [[Princeton Cannon Song]], the Princeton University [[fight song]].

[[Bob Dylan]] wrote "Day of The Locusts" (for his 1970 album ''[[New Morning#Day of the Locusts|New Morning]]'') about his experience of receiving an honorary doctorate from the University. It is a reference to the negative experience he had and it mentions the [[Brood X]] [[cicada]] infestation Princeton experienced that June 1970.

==="Old Nassau"===
{{main|Old Nassau}}
{{listen
 | filename = Old Nassau.ogg
 | title = Old Nassau
 | description = 
 | format = [[ogg]]
}}
"[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=July 5, 2008 | publisher = Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed "[[Old Nassau reaction]]" because the solution turns orange and then black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 |title=The Old Nassau reaction | work = Journal of Chemical Education | publisher = ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education | accessdate = February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reclaimed Water Jars.jpg|thumb|Sequence of reclamation from left: raw sewage, plant effluent, and finally reclaimed water (after several treatment steps)]]

'''Reclaimed''' or '''recycled water''' (also called '''wastewater reuse''' or '''water reclamation''') is the process of converting [[wastewater]] into water that can be [[reuse]]d for other purposes. Reuse may include [[irrigation]] of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing [[surface water]] and [[groundwater]] (i.e., [[groundwater recharge]]). Reused water may also be directed toward fulfilling certain needs in residences (e.g. [[Flush toilet|toilet flushing]]), businesses, and industry, and could even be treated to reach [[drinking water]] standards. This last option is called either "direct potable reuse" or "indirect potable" reuse, depending on the approach used. Colloquially, the term "toilet to tap" also refers to potable reuse.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview&gt;{{cite journal | last=Warsinger | first=David M. | last2=Chakraborty | first2=Sudip | last3=Tow | first3=Emily W. | last4=Plumlee | first4=Megan H. | last5=Bellona | first5=Christopher | last6=Loutatidou | first6=Savvina | last7=Karimi | first7=Leila | last8=Mikelonis | first8=Anne M. | last9=Achilli | first9=Andrea | last10=Ghassemi | first10=Abbas | last11=Padhye | first11=Lokesh P. | last12=Snyder | first12=Shane A. | last13=Curcio | first13=Stefano | last14=Vecitis | first14=Chad D. | last15=Arafat | first15=Hassan A. | last16=Lienhard | first16=John H. | title=A review of polymeric membranes and processes for potable water reuse | journal=Progress in Polymer Science | publisher=Elsevier BV | year=2018 | issn=0079-6700 | doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2018.01.004 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reclaiming water for reuse applications instead of using [[Fresh water|freshwater]] supplies can be a water-saving measure. When used water is eventually discharged back into natural water sources, it can still have benefits to [[ecosystem]]s, improving streamflow, nourishing plant life and recharging [[aquifer]]s, as part of the natural [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bischel | first =H.N. |author2=J.E.

Wastewater reuse is a long-established practice used for irrigation, especially in [[arid]] countries. Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable [[water management]] allows water to remain as an alternative water source for human activities. This can reduce [[water scarcity|scarcity]] and alleviate pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies.&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C.

== Background ==
[[File:Effluent storage tank from where treated effluent is pumped away for irrigation (3232428204).jpg|thumb|[[Irrigation]] water is pumped from this tank which stores effluent received from a [[constructed wetland]] in Haran-Al-Awamied, Syria.]]
Achieving more [[sustainable sanitation]] and wastewater management  will require emphasis on actions linked to resource management, such as wastewater reuse or [[excreta reuse]] that will keep valuable resources available for productive uses.&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt; This in turn supports human wellbeing and broader [[sustainability]].

Simply stated, reclaimed water is water that is used more than one time before it passes back into the natural water cycle. Advances in wastewater treatment technology allow communities to reuse water for many different purposes. The water is treated differently depending upon the source and use of the water and how it gets delivered.

Cycled repeatedly through the planetary hydrosphere, all water on Earth is recycled water, but the terms "recycled water" or "reclaimed water" typically mean wastewater sent from a home or business through a [[Sewerage|sewer system]] to a [[wastewater treatment plant]], where it is treated to a level consistent with its intended use.

The [[World Health Organization]] has recognized the following principal driving forces for wastewater reuse:&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017.

#increasing [[water scarcity]] and stress,
#increasing populations and related [[food security]] issues,
#increasing environmental pollution from improper wastewater disposal, and
#increasing recognition of the resource value of [[wastewater]], [[Human waste|excreta]] and [[greywater]].
Water recycling and reuse is of increasing importance, not only in arid regions but also in cities and contaminated environments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Meeker|first2=Melissa|last3=Minton|first3=Julie|last4=O'Donohue|first4=Mark|date=4 September 2015|title=International research agency perspectives on potable water reuse|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2015/EW/C5EW00165J|journal=Environmental Science: Water Research &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|doi=10.1039/C5EW00165J|issn=2053-1419|last1=Burgess|first1=Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already, the groundwater [[aquifers]] that are used by over half of the world population are being over-drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwri-usa.org/documents/NWRIWhitePaperDPRBenefitsJan2012.pdf|title=Direct Potable Reuse: Benefits for Public Water Supplies, Agriculture, the Environment, and Energy Conservation|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuse will continue to increase as the world’s population becomes increasingly urbanized and concentrated near coastlines, where local [[freshwater]] supplies are limited or are available only with large [[capital expenditure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=RIPPLE EFFECTS: POPULATION AND COASTAL REGIONS|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnadd169.pdf|last1=Creel|first1=Liz|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|title=Guidelines for water reuse|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of freshwater can be saved by wastewater reuse and recycling, reducing [[environmental pollution]] and improving [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reuse can be an alternative [[water supply]] option.

== Types and applications ==

Most of the uses of water reclamation are non potable uses such as washing cars, flushing toilets, cooling water for power plants, concrete mixing, artificial lakes, irrigation for golf courses and public parks, and for hydraulic fracturing. Where applicable, systems run a dual piping system to keep the recycled water separate from the potable water.

The main reclaimed water applications in the world are shown below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Water Quality Management Strategy.|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/044e7a7e-558a-4abf-b985-2e831d8f36d1/files/water-recycling-guidelines-health-environmental-21.pdf|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Recycling and Reuse: The Environmental Benefits|url=https://www3.epa.gov/region9/water/recycling/|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC92582/lb-na-26947-en-n.pdf|title=Water reuse in Europe.

===  De facto wastewater reuse (unplanned potable reuse) === 
De facto, unacknowledged or unplanned potable reuse refers to a situation where reuse of treated wastewater is, in fact, practiced but is not officially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for water reuse|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[wastewater treatment plant]] from one city may be discharging [[effluents]] to a [[river]] which is used as a drinking water supply for another city downstream.

Unplanned Indirect Potable Use&lt;ref name="unplanned-ipu"&gt;[[Public Utilities Board]], [http://www.pub.gov.sg/NEWater_files/overseas_experiences/index.html Overseas Experiences], accessed 24 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has existed for a long time. Large towns on the [[River Thames]] upstream of [[London]] ([[Oxford]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Swindon]], [[Bracknell]]) discharge their treated sewage ("non-potable water") into the Thames, which supplies water to London downstream. In the United States, the [[Mississippi River]] serves as both the destination of sewage treatment plant effluent and the source of potable water.

=== Urban reuse ===
* Unrestricted: The use of reclaimed water for [[Non potable|non-potable]] applications in municipal settings, where public access is not restricted.
* Restricted: The use of reclaimed water for non-potable applications in municipal settings, where public access is controlled or restricted by physical or institutional barriers, such as fencing, advisory signage, or temporal access restriction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for water reuse|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|website=USEPA|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural reuse ===
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
There are benefits of using recycled water for irrigation, including the lower cost compared to some other sources and consistency of supply regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated water restrictions. When reclaimed water is used for irrigation in agriculture, the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content of the treated wastewater has the benefit of acting as a [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Otoo"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can make the [[reuse of excreta]] contained in sewage attractive.&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

The irrigation water can be used in different ways on different crops:
* [[Food crops]] to be eaten raw: crops which are intended for human consumption to be eaten raw or unprocessed. 
* [[Processed food]] crops: crops which are intended for human consumption not to be eaten raw but after treatment process (i.e. cooked, industrially processed). 
* Non-food crops: crops which are not intended for human consumption (e.g. pastures, forage, fiber, ornamental, seed, forest and turf crops).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 16075-1:2015 - Guidelines for treated wastewater use for irrigation projects -- Part 1: The basis of a reuse project for irrigation|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62756|website=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, [[agriculture]] is increasingly using untreated wastewater for irrigation - often in an unsafe manner. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce [[water resources]] with industry and municipal users, there is often no alternative for farmers but to use [[water pollution|water polluted]] with urban waste directly to water their crops.

There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated  wastewater in agriculture. Wastewater from cities can contain a mixture of chemical and biological pollutants. In low-income countries, there are often high levels of pathogens from excreta. In [[Emerging countries|emerging nations]], where industrial development is outpacing environmental regulation, there are increasing risks from inorganic and organic chemicals. The [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), has developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006.&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; These guidelines advocate a ‘multiple-barrier’ approach  wastewater use, for example by encouraging farmers to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.&lt;ref name="Otoo" /&gt;

=== Environmental reuse === 
The use of reclaimed water to create, enhance, sustain, or augment water bodies including [[wetland]]s, aquatic habitats, or stream flow is called "environmental reuse".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, [[constructed wetland]]s fed by wastewater provide both [[wastewater treatment]] and [[habitat]]s for flora and fauna.

=== Industrial reuse === 
The use of reclaimed water to recharge aquifers that are not used as a potable water source.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===  Planned potable reuse ===
Planned potable reuse is publicly acknowledged as an intentional project to recycle water for drinking water. There are two ways in which potable water can be delivered for reuse - "Indirect Potable Reuse" (IPR) and "Direct Potable Reuse". Both these forms of reuse are described below, and commonly involve a more formal public process and public consultation program than is the case with de facto or unacknowledged reuse. In ‘indirect’ potable reuse applications, the reclaimed wastewater is used directly or mixed with other sources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Pecson|first2=B|last3=Trussell|first3=R.S.|last4=Trussell|first4=R.R.|title=Potable reuse treatment trains throughout the world|url=http://www.trusselltech.com/uploads/media_items/potable-reuse-treatment-trains-throughout-the-world.original.pdf|journal=J. Water Supply Res. Technol.-AQUA|volume=62|pages=321–338|last1=Gerrity|first1=D|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct potable reuse is also called "toilet to tap".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Some water agencies reuse highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater or resource recovery plants as a reliable, drought proof source of drinking water. By using advanced purification processes, they produce water that meets all applicable drinking water standards.  System reliability and frequent monitoring and testing are imperative to them meeting stringent controls.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

The water needs of a community, water sources, public health regulations, costs, and the types of water infrastructure in place, such as distribution systems, man-made reservoirs, or natural groundwater basins, determine if and how reclaimed water can be part of the drinking water supply. Some communities reuse water to replenish groundwater basins. Others put it into surface water reservoirs. In these instances the reclaimed water is blended with other water supplies and/or sits in storage for a certain amount of time before it is drawn out and gets treated again at a water treatment or distribution system.  In some communities, the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.

Modern technologies such as [[reverse osmosis]] and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

==== Indirect potable reuse ====
Indirect potable reuse (IPR) means the water is delivered to the consumer indirectly.  After it is purified, the reused water blends with other supplies and/or sits a while in some sort of storage, man-made or natural, before it gets delivered to a pipeline that leads to a water treatment plant or distribution system. That storage could be a [[groundwater]] basin or a surface water reservoir.

Some municipalities are using and others are investigating Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) of reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water may be pumped into (subsurface recharge) or percolated down to (surface recharge) groundwater aquifers, pumped out, treated again, and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also be referred to as ''groundwater recharging''. This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth/sand (absorption) and microflora in the soil (biodegradation).

IPR or even unplanned potable use of reclaimed wastewater is used in many countries, where the latter is discharged into groundwater to hold back [[saline intrusion]] in coastal aquifers. IPR has generally included some type of environmental buffer, but conditions in certain areas have created an urgent need for more direct alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Michael|first2=C.|last3=Duan|first3=X.|last4=He|first4=X.|last5=Dionysiou|first5=D.D.|last6=Mills|first6=M.A.|last7=Fatta-Kassinos|first7=D.|date=June 2015|title=Dissolved effluent organic matter: Characteristics and potential implications in wastewater treatment and reuse applications|journal=Water Research|volume=77|pages=213–248|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.03.011|last1=Michael-Kordatou|first1=I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Direct potable reuse ====
Direct potable reuse means the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.  Direct potable reuse may occur with or without “engineered storage” such as underground or above ground tanks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) scheme, water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.  Direct potable reuse may occur with or without “engineered storage” such as underground or above ground tanks. In other words, DPR is the introduction of reclaimed water derived from urban wastewater after extensive treatment and monitoring to assure that strict water quality requirements are met at all times, directly into a municipal water supply system.

==== Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) ==== 
IPR occurs through the augmentation of drinking water supplies with urban wastewater treated to a level suitable for IPR followed by an environmental buffer (e.g. rivers, dams, aquifers, etc.) that precedes drinking water treatment. In this case, urban wastewater passes through a series of treatment steps that encompasses [[membrane filtration]] and separation processes (e.g. MF, UF and RO), followed by an advanced chemical oxidation process (e.g. UV, UV+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ozone).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Reuse in space ===
Wastewater reclamation can be especially important in relation to [[human spaceflight]].  In 1998, [[NASA]] announced it had built a human waste reclamation [[bioreactor]] designed for use in the [[International Space Station]] and a manned [[Mars]] mission. Human [[urine]] and [[feces]] are input into one end of the reactor and pure [[oxygen]], pure [[water]], and [[compost]] ([[humanure]]) are output from the other end. The soil could be used for growing [[vegetable]]s, and the [[bioreactor]] also produces [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/ASEN/asen5519/1999-Files/presentations/dave-waller.pdf University of Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript902.htm|title=Scientific American Frontiers|work=Scientific American Frontiers - PBS Programs - PBS|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboard the [[International Space Station]], [[astronauts]] have been able to drink recycled urine due to the introduction of the [[ECLSS]] system.  The system costs $250 million and has been working since May 2009. The system recycles wastewater and urine back into potable water used for drinking, food preparation, and oxygen generation.  This cuts back on the need for resupplying the space station so often.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/090520-space-urine.html|title=Astronauts Drink Recycled Urine, and Celebrate|date=May 20, 2009|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Water/wastewater reuse, as an alternative water source, can provide significant economic, social and environmental benefits, which are key motivators for implementing such reuse programmes. Specifically, in agriculture, irrigation with wastewater may contribute to improve production yields, reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Irrigation with Treated Wastewater: Potential Impacts on Microbial Function and Diversity in Agricultural Soils|publisher=Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F698_2015_346|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* Increased [[water resources|water availability]] 
* [[Drinking water]] substitution - keep drinking water for drinking and reclaimed water for non-drinking use (i.e. industry, cleaning, irrigation, domestic uses, toilet flushing, etc.)
* Reduced over-abstraction of surface and groundwater
* Reduced energy consumption associated with production, treatment, and distribution of water compared to using deep groundwater resources, water importation or desalination 
* Reduced nutrient loads to receiving waters (i.e. rivers, canals and other surface [[water resources]])
* Reduced manufacturing costs of using high quality reclaimed water
* Increased agricultural production (i.e. crop yields)
* Reduced application of fertilizers (i.e. conservation of nutrients, reducing the need for artificial fertilizer (e.g. soil nutrition by the nutrients existing in the treated effluents))
* Enhanced environmental protection by restoration of streams, [[wetlands]] and ponds
* Increased employment and local economy (e.g. tourism, agriculture).

== Design considerations ==
=== Distribution ===
[[File:Nonpotable water pipeline in Mountain View.gk.jpg|thumb|A lavender-colored pipeline carrying nonpotable water in a dual piping system in Mountain View, California, U.S.]]
Nonpotable reclaimed water is often distributed with a [[dual piping]] network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely separate from potable water pipes.

In many cities using reclaimed water, it is now in such demand that consumers are only allowed to use it on assigned days. Some cities that previously offered unlimited reclaimed water at a flat rate are now beginning to charge citizens by the amount they use.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Treatment processes ===
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}
For many types of reuse applications wastewater must pass through numerous [[sewage treatment]] process steps before it can be used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse osmosis), and disinfection.

There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: [[Ozonation]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[Aerobic treatment system|aerobic treatment]] ([[membrane bioreactor]]), [[forward osmosis]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[Advanced oxidation process|advanced oxidation]].&lt;ref name=PotableReuseMembraneReview/&gt;

Wastewater is generally treated to only [[Secondary treatment|secondary level treatment]] when used for irrigation.

A pump station distributes reclaimed water to users around the city. This may include golf courses, agricultural uses, cooling towers, or in land fills.

=== Alternative options ===
Rather than treating wastewater for reuse purposes, other options can achieve similar effects of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] savings: 
* [[Greywater]] reuse systems - at a household level, treated or untreated greywater may be used for [[flush toilet]]s or to water the garden. 
* [[Rainwater harvesting]] and [[Stormwater harvesting|stormwater recovery]]- Urban design systems which incorporate rainwater harvesting and reduce runoff are known as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] (LID) in the United States and [[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] (SUDS) in the United Kingdom.   
* Seawater [[desalination]] - an energy-intensive process where salt and other minerals are removed from seawater to produce potable water for drinking and irrigation, typically through [[membrane filtration]] ([[reverse-osmosis]]), and [[steam-distillation]].

=== Costs  ===
The cost of reclaimed water exceeds that of [[potable water]] in many regions of the world, where a [[fresh water]] supply is plentiful. However, reclaimed water is usually sold to citizens at a cheaper rate to encourage its use. As fresh water supplies become limited from distribution costs, increased population demands, or climate change reducing sources, the cost ratios will evolve also. The evaluation of reclaimed water needs to consider the entire water supply system, as it may bring important value of flexibility into the overall system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=S.X.|date=2012|title=A real options approach to the design and architecture of water supply systems using innovative water technologies under uncertainty|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydroinformatics|author2=V. Babovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed water systems usually require a [[dual piping]] network, often with additional [[water tower|storage tanks]], which adds to the costs of the system.

=== Barriers to implementation ===
* Full-scale implementation and operation of water reuse schemes still face regulatory, economic, social and institutional challenges.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ncube-EJ-Water-Scarcity-a-driver-for-water-reclamation-and-collaboration.pdf|title=Water Scarcity, a driver for water reclamation, reuse and collaboration|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Economic viability of water reuse schemes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Costs of water quality monitoring and identification of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/reuse.htm|title=Water Reuse - Environment - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in contaminant identification may include the separation of inorganic and [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]], [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], [[Colloid|Colloids]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pintilie|first=Loredana|last2=Torres|first2=Carmen M.|last3=Teodosiu|first3=Carmen|last4=Castells|first4=Francesc|date=December 15, 2016|title=Urban wastewater reclamation for industrial reuse: An LCA case study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652616311143|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=139|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.209|issn=0959-6526|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health aspects ==
Reclaimed water is considered safe when appropriately used. Reclaimed water planned for use in recharging aquifers or augmenting surface water receives adequate and reliable treatment before mixing with naturally occurring water and undergoing natural restoration processes. Some of this water eventually becomes part of drinking water supplies.

A water quality study published in 2009 compared the water quality differences of reclaimed/recycled water, surface water, and groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helgeson|first=Tom|title=A Reconnaissance-Level Quantitative Comparison of Reclaimed Water, Surface Water, and Groundwater|year=2009|publisher=WateReuse Research Foundation|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=978-1-934183-12-0|pages=141|url=http://www.watereuse.org/product/reconnaissance-level-quantitative-comparison-reclaimed-water-surface-water-and-groundwater}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results indicate that reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater are more similar than dissimilar with regard to constituents. The researchers tested for 244 representative constituents typically found in water. When detected, most constituents were in the parts per billion and parts per trillion range. DEET (a bug repellant), and caffeine were found in all water types and virtually in all samples. Triclosan (in anti-bacterial soap &amp; toothpaste) was found in all water types, but detected in higher levels (parts per trillion) in reclaimed water than in surface or groundwater. Very few hormones/steroids were detected in samples, and when detected were at very low levels. Haloacetic acids (a disinfection by-product) were found in all types of samples, even groundwater. The largest difference between reclaimed water and the other waters appears to be that reclaimed water has been disinfected and thus has disinfection by-products (due to chlorine use).

A 2005 study titled "Irrigation of Parks, Playgrounds, and Schoolyards with Reclaimed Water" found that there had been no incidences of illness or disease from either microbial pathogens or chemicals, and the risks of using reclaimed water for irrigation are not measurably different from irrigation using potable water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crook|first=James|title=Irrigation of Parks, Playgrounds, and Schoolyards: Extent and Safety|year=2005|publisher=WateReuse Research Foundation|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-9747586-3-9|pages=60|url=http://www.watereuse.org/product/irrigation-parks-playgrounds-and-schoolyards-reclaimed-water-extent-and-safety-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study conducted by the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] in the United States of America found that the risk of exposure to certain microbial and chemical contaminants from drinking reclaimed water does not appear to be any higher than the risk experienced in at least some current drinking water treatment systems, and may be orders of magnitude lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13303|title=Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nation's Water Supply through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater|date=2012|publisher=National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommends adjustments to the federal regulatory framework that could enhance public health protection for both planned and unplanned (or de facto) reuse and increase public confidence in water reuse.

Many humans associate a feeling of [[disgust]] with reclaimed water and 13% of a survey group said they would not even sip it.&lt;ref name="Kean"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Winter 2015|title=Waste Not, Want Not|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/waste-not-want-not|journal=Distillations|volume=1|issue=4|page=5|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonetheless, the main health risk for potable use of reclaimed water is the potential for pharmaceutical and other household chemicals or their derivatives ([[Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s) to persist in this water.&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/pharmaceuticals-in-the-environment-a-growing-problem/20067898.article|title=Pharmaceuticals in the environment: a growing problem|date=19 February 2015|work=The Pharmaceutical Journal|last1=Owens|first1=Brian|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be less of a concern if [[human excreta]] was kept out of [[sewage]] by using [[dry toilet]]s or systems that treat [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separately from [[greywater]].

To address these concerns about the source water, reclaimed water providers use multi-barrier treatment processes and constant monitoring to ensure that reclaimed water is safe and treated properly for the intended end use.

== Environmental aspects ==
There is debate about possible health and environmental effects. To address these concerns, A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product (PPCP) exposures was conducted by the [[WateReuse|WateReuse Research Foundation]]. For each of four scenarios in which people come into contact with recycled water used for irrigation - children on the playground, golfers, and landscape, and agricultural workers - the findings from the study indicate that it could take anywhere from a few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs that we get in a single day through routine activities.

Using reclaimed water for non-potable uses saves potable water for drinking, since less potable water will be used for non-potable uses.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region09/water/recycling/|title=Water Recycling and Reuse: The Environmental Benefits/|publisher=US Environment Protection Agency|date=23 February 2016|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sometimes contains higher levels of nutrients such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[oxygen]] which may somewhat help [[fertilizer|fertilize]] garden and agricultural plants when used for irrigation.

The usage of water reclamation decreases the pollution sent to sensitive environments.  It can also enhance [[wetland]]s, which benefits the wildlife depending on that [[eco-system]]. It also helps to stop the chances of drought as recycling of water reduces the use of fresh water supply from underground sources.  For instance, The San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant instituted a water recycling program to protect the [[San Francisco Bay]] area's natural salt water marshes.&lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;

The main potential risks that are associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes, when the treatment is not adequate are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/044e7a7e-558a-4abf-b985-2e831d8f36d1/files/water-recycling-guidelines-health-environmental-21.pdf|title=NATIONAL WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[contamination]] of the food chain with microcontaminants, [[pathogens]] (i.e. [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]], [[helminths]]), or [[antibiotic resistance]] determinants; 
# soil [[Soil salinity|salinization]] and accumulation of various unknown constituents that might adversely affect agricultural production; 
# distribution of the indigenous soil [[microbial communities]];
# alteration of the [[physicochemical]] and [[microbiological]] properties of the soil and contribution to the accumulation of chemical/biological [[contaminants]] (e.g. [[heavy metals]], chemicals (i.e. [[boron]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[pesticides]]/[[herbicides]]), natural chemicals (i.e. [[hormones]]), contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) (i.e. [[pharmaceuticals]] and their [[metabolites]], [[personal care products]], [[household chemicals]] and [[food additive]]s and their transformation products), etc.) in it and subsequent uptake by plants and crops; 
# excessive growth of [[algae]] and vegetation in canals carrying wastewater (i.e. [[eutrophication]]); 
# groundwater quality degradation by the various reclaimed water contaminants, migrating and accumulating in the soil and aquifers.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation|Ecological sanitation#History}}

Wastewater reuse (planned or unplanned)  is an ancient practice, which has been applied since the dawn of human history and is closely connected to the development of sanitation provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/04/01/000009265_3961006165519/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Reuse of wastewater in agriculture: A guide for planners|last2=Kalbermatten|first2=J. M.|last3=Bartone|first3=C. R.|last1=Khouri|first1=N|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. ===
In the U.S., the [[Clean Water Act]] of 1972 mandated elimination of the discharge of untreated waste from municipal and industrial sources to make water safe for fishing and recreation. The US federal government provided billions of dollars in grants for building sewage treatment plants around the country. Modern treatment plants, usually using [[oxidation]] and/or [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] in addition to primary and secondary treatment, were required to meet certain standards.&lt;ref&gt;33 Usc 1251 seq., 1972, [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]], Enacted by Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles County]]'s sanitation districts started providing treated wastewater for landscape irrigation in parks and golf courses in 1929.  The first reclaimed water facility in [[California]] was built at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in 1932.  The Water Replenishment District of Southern California was the first groundwater agency to obtain permitted use of recycled water for groundwater recharge in 1962.

[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] is located in Southern California, USA, and houses a classic example in indirect potable reuse.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/volume6/v6issue1/199-a6-1-4/file|title=Remaking waste as water: The governance of recycled effluent for potable water supply|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watereuse.org/files/s/docs/OCWD_Tampa _Potable_Reuse_Workshop.pdf.|title=Orange County’s groundwater replenishment system: Potable reuse for the best available water|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the injected water consists of recycled water, starting as of 1976 with Water Factory 21, which used RO and high lime to clean the water (production capacity of 19,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wastewater.co.za/images/files/Advanced_reuse_Whk_to_Singapore_Water_May_2003.pdf|title=Advanced reuse: from Windhoek to Singapore and beyond, Water|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plant was decommissioned in 2004 and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity (265,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day with an ultimate capacity of 492,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day), under the name of Groundwater Replenishment System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/volume6/v6issue1/199-a6-1-4/file|title=Remaking waste as water: The governance of recycled effluent for potable water supply,|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidelines and regulations ==

=== International organisations ===

* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO): “Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater” (2006).&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt; 
* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP): “Guidelines for municipal wastewater reuse in the Mediterranean region” (2005). 
* United Nations Water Decade Programme on Capacity Development (UNW-DPC): Proceedings on the UNWater project “Safe use of wastewater in agriculture” (2013).

=== European Union ===

The health and environmental safety conditions under which wastewater may be reused are not specifically regulated at the [[European Union]] (EU) level. There are no guidelines or regulations at EU level on water quality for water reuse purposes. In the [[Water Framework Directive]], reuse of water is mentioned as one of the possible measures to achieve the Directive’s quality goals, however this remains a relatively vague recommendation rather than a requirement: Part B of Annex VI refers to reuse as one of the “supplementary measures which Member States within each river basin district may choose to adopt as part of the programme of measures required under Article 11(4)”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC92582|title=Water Reuse in Europe - Relevant guidelines, needs for and barriers to innovation|last2=Gawlik|first2=Bernd|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|last1=Alcalde Sanz|first1=Laura|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides that, Article 12 of the [[Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive|Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive]] concerning the reuse of treated wastewater states that “treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate”, is not specific enough to promote water reuse and it leaves too much room for interpretation as to what can be considered as an “appropriate” situation to reuse treated wastewater.

Despite the lack of common water reuse criteria at the EU level, several Member States (MS) have issued their own legislative frameworks, regulations, or guidelines for different water reuse applications (e.g. Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, and Spain).

However, after an evaluation carried out by the [[European Commission]] (EC) on the water reuse standards of several member states it was concluded that they differ in their approach. There are important divergences among the different standards regarding the permitted uses, the parameters to be monitored, and the limit values allowed. This lack of harmonization among water reuse standards might create some trade barriers for agricultural goods irrigated with reclaimed water. Once on the common market, the level of safety in the producing member states may be not considered as sufficient by the importing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Reuse - Environment - European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/reuse.htm|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative standards on wastewater reuse from European member states are the following:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== U.S. ===
Reclaimed water is not regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), but the EPA has developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/region9/water/recycling/|title=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100FS7K.pdf|title=2012 Guidelines for Water Reuse|date=2012|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines provide a framework for states to develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements.

==Examples==

=== Australia ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in Australia}}
When there are droughts in [[Australia]] interest in reclaimed effluent options increases. Brisbane has been seen as a leader in this trend, and other cities and towns will review the [[Western Corridor Recycled Water Project]] once completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Van Buynder|first2=Paul|last3=Lugg|first3=Richard|last4=Blair|first4=Palenque|last5=Devine|first5=Brian|last6=Cook|first6=Angus|last7=Weinstein|first7=Philip|date=17 March 2009|title=Indirect Potable Reuse: A Sustainable Water Supply Alternative|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=3|pages=1174–1203|doi=10.3390/ijerph6031174|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Clemencia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While there are currently no full-scale direct potable reuse schemes operating in Australia, the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] is investigating the option of installing a potable reuse scheme at its Davis research base in [[Antarctica]]. To enhance the quality of the marine discharge from the Davis [[Wastewater Treatment Plant|WWTP]], a number of different, proven technologies have been selected to be used in the future, such as [[ozonation]], UV [[disinfection]], [[chlorine]], as well as UF, activated carbon filtration and RO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Israel ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in Israel}}
As of 2010, Israel leads the world in the proportion of water it recycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE6A01DQ20101114?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|title=Arid Israel recycles waste water on grand scale|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel treats 80% of its sewage (400 billion liters a year), and 100% of the sewage from the Tel Aviv metropolitan area is treated and reused as irrigation water for agriculture and public works. As of today, all the reclaimed sewage water in Israel is used for agricultural and land improvement purposes.

=== Namibia ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in Namibia}}
An example of direct potable reuse is the case of [[Windhoek]] (Namibia, New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant (NGWRP)), where treated wastewater has been blended with drinking water for more than 40 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced [[coagulation]]/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent [[ozone]], biological activated carbon/granular [[activated carbon]], [[ultrafiltration]] (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The reclaimed wastewater nowadays represent about 14% of the city’s drinking water production.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=TREATMENT OF WASTEWATER FOR RE-USE IN THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEM OF WINDHOEK|url=http://www.ewisa.co.za/literature/files/339%20Menge.pdf|last1=MENGE|first1=J|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in Singapore}}
In Singapore reclaimed water is called [[NEWater]] and is bottled directly from an advanced water purification facility for educational and celebratory purposes. Though most of the reused water is used for high-tech industry in Singapore, a small amount is returned to reservoirs for drinking water.

At the end of 2002, the programme - successfully branded as NEWater - had garnered a 98 percent acceptance rate, with 82% of respondents indicating that they would drink the reused water directly, another 16% only when mixed with reservoir water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781843393641/water-sensitive-cities|title=Water Sensitive Cities|publisher=IWA Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The produced NEWater after stabilization (addition of alkaline chemicals) is in compliance with the WHO requirements and can be piped off to its wide range of applications (e.g. reuse in industry, discharge to a drinking water reservoir).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/newater/Pages/default.aspx|title=Singapore Public Utilities Board|accessdate=29 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528095250/http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/newater/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NEWater]] now makes up around 30% of Singapore’s total use, by 2060 Singapore’s National Water Agency plans to triple the current NEWater capacity as to meet 50% of Singapore’s future water demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781780400075/milestones-water-reuse|title=Global milestones in water reuse: keys to success and trends in development|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{Further|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
In South Africa, the main driver for wastewater reuse is drought conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, in [[Beaufort West]], South Africa’s a direct wastewater reclamation plant (WRP) for the production of drinking water was constructed in the end of 2010, as a result of acute [[water scarcity]] (production of 2,300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/146252.pdf|title=Risk Assessment for South Africa’s first direct wastewater reclamation system for drinking water production|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imesa.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-6.pdf|title=Beaufort West Water Reclamation Plant: First Direct (Toilet-to-Tap) Water Reclamation Plant in South Africa|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process configuration based on multi-barrier concept and includes the following treatment processes: sand filtration, [[UF]], two-stage [[Reverse osmosis|RO]], and permeate disinfected by [[ultraviolet light]] (UV).

=== U.S. ===
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in the United States}}
The leaders in use of reclaimed water in the U.S. are [[Florida]] and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ufl.edu/2000/05/24/water/ UF Professor: Drought Highlights Value Of Reused Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907013345/http://news.ufl.edu/2000/05/24/water/ |date=2006-09-07 }}. [[University of Florida]] News. May 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2012 U.S. National Research Council report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Water-Reuse-Potential-Expanding/13303/|title=Water Reuse: Potential for Expanding the Nation's Water Supply through Reuse of Municipal Wastewater (2012) : Division on Earth and Life Studies|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a committee of independent experts found that expanding the reuse of municipal wastewater for irrigation, industrial uses, and drinking water augmentation could significantly increase the United States’ total available water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4307-Water-Reuse|title=Division on Earth and Life Studies|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''"red neuron"''' (acidophilic or "eosinophilic" neuron) is a pathological finding in [[neurons]], generally of the [[central nervous system]], indicative of acute neuronal injury and subsequent [[apoptosis]] or [[necrosis]]. Acidophilic neurons are often found in the first 12–24 hours after an [[ischemic]] injury such as a stroke. Since neurons are permanent cells, they are most susceptible to hypoxic injury. The red coloration is due to [[pyknosis]] or degradation of the nucleus and loss of [[Nissl bodies]] which are normally stained blue ([[basophilic]]) on hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining ([[H&amp;E stain]]). This leaves only the degraded proteins which stains red ([[eosinophilic]]). Acidophilic neurons also can be stained with acidic dyes other than eosin (e.g. acid fuchsin and light green yellowish).&lt;ref name="Robbins and Cotran's"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.inkling.com/read/robbins-cotran-pathologic-basis-of-disease-8th/chapter-28/cellular-pathology-of-the | title=Robbins and Cotran’s Pathological Basis of Disease 8ed | publisher=Elsevier | author=Kumar| year=2010 | pages=1281 | isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''repair café''' is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackman|first1=John|title='Repair Café' Gets Stuff Fixed|url=http://www.rethinklocal.org/blog/2013/07/repair-cafe-gets-stuff-fixed/|website=Rethink Local website|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-85913052.html Global Village: Warum eine neue Bewegung aus den Niederlanden Toaster und Bügeleisen repariert ]" [[Der Spiegel]], 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www1.wdr.de/themen/ratgeber/repaircafe114.html Mehr reparieren, weniger konsumieren] [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sz-WohLQyQ Repair Cafe nu ook doorgedrongen in Duitsland]" [[heute]], 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/07/201271654749156813.html Dutch group mends broken items for free]" [[Al Jazeera]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/2013010832354-repareren-weer Repareren is weer in]" [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]], 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/repair-cafe-verhuist-naar-elzenhof-opent-cafe-molenbeek Repair Café naar Elzenhof]" Brusselnieuws, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was devised by Martine Postma in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/amsterdam-tries-to-change-culture-with-repair-cafes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; An Effort to Bury a Throwaway Culture One Repair at a Time]" [[The New York Times]], 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2009, the first Repair Café was held at Fijnhout Theater, [[Amsterdam-West]]. On 2 March 2010, the Repair Café Foundation was set up. The foundation was formed to support local groups around the world in setting up their own Repair Cafés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/how-to-set-up-your-own-repair-cafe | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 14 November 2016 | first1 = Katherine | last1 = Purvis | first2 = Nell | last2 = Card | first3 = Lucy | last3 = Palmer | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = How to set up your own repair café}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of Repair Cafés has grown quickly. In March 2016 Postma registered more than 1,000 Repair Cafés worldwide, 327 in the Netherlands, 309 in Germany, 22 in the UK, 21 in the US, 15 in Canada, four Australia and one in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319022011/http://repaircafe.org/bezoeken Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 19 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the number of Repair Cafés climbed over 1,200, in March 2018 the number reached 1,500 in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130020242/https://repaircafe.org/en/visit/ Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the first [[International Repair Day]] was announced. It is intended to be an annual event, taking place on the third Saturday of October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voicemag.uk/blog/3325/dialogues-and-debates-ugo-vallauri|title=Dialogues and Debates: Ugo Vallauri|work=Voice Magazine|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
In 2017, the Repair Café Foundation developed an online tool - the [http://RepairMonitor.org RepairMonitor] - enabling volunteers to collect and share repair data via a central database. In March 2018, information about almost 4,000 repairs had been entered into this system, aiming to promote reparability and durability of products.   

==3D printing of broken parts==
Some repair cafés have begun to use 3D printers for replicating broken parts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid1565685/repair-cafe-maakt-onvindbare-wisselstukken-met-3d-printer Repair café maakt onvindbare wisselstukken met 3D-printer]" [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken pieces of domestic appliances may be able to be pieced or glued back together, after which they can be scanned with a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]]. Examples of 3D scanners include David Starter-Kit, [[3D Systems]] Sense, [[MakerBot]] Digitizer, Fuel 3D, Microsoft [[Kinect]], and [[Asus]] Xtion.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion can be used together with ReconstructMe software for 3D scanning&lt;/ref&gt; Once the physical object is scanned, the 3D model is rendered. It can be converted to a .stl or .obj format and revised using [[geometry processing]] software such as makeprintable, netfabb, [[MeshLab]], Meshmixer, [[Ultimaker|Cura]], or [[Slic3r]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Cura and Slic3r have some fixup tools, despite being mainly a slicer program&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed using a [[3D printer client]], creating a physical part using the 3D printer. The complete process takes some time to complete.

To reduce the time needed in the repair café, people might choose to use a pre-made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Examples of such websites are [[Thingiverse]], [[CGTrader]], [[GrabCAD]], and Google [[3D Warehouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like [[Autodesk 123D|123D Catch]], and/or choose (in the event the repair café does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D ''model'' made in the repair café, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like [[Ponoko]], [[Shapeways]], and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair café to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

'''Scientometrics''' is the study of measuring and analysing [[science]], technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff"&gt;[[Loet Leydesdorff|Leydesdorff, L.]] and Milojevic, S., "Scientometrics" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4566 arXiv:1208.4566] (2013), forthcoming in: Lynch, M. (editor), ''International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences'' subsection 85030. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice there is a significant overlap between scientometrics and other scientific fields such as [[bibliometrics]], information systems, [[information science]] and [[science of science policy]].

== Historical development ==
Modern scientometrics is mostly based on the work of [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] and [[Eugene Garfield]]. The latter created the [[Science Citation Index]]&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; and founded the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] which is heavily used for scientometric analysis. A dedicated academic journal, [[Scientometrics (journal)|''Scientometrics'']], was established in 1978. The industrialization of science increased the quantity of publications and research outcomes and the rise of the computers allowed effective analysis of this data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price|De Solla Price, D.]], ''editorial statement''. '''Scientometrics''' Volume 1, Issue 1 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; While the sociology of science focused on the behavior of scientists, scientometrics focused on the analysis of publications.&lt;ref name="ScientometricsLeydesdorff" /&gt; Accordingly, scientometrics is also referred to as the scientific and empirical study of science and its outcomes.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowry | first1 = Paul Benjamin | last2 = Romans | first2 = Denton | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Aaron | year = 2004 | title = Global journal prestige and supporting disciplines: A scientometric study of information systems journals | ssrn = 666145 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 29–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowry, Paul Benjamin 2013"&gt;Lowry, Paul Benjamin; Moody, Gregory D.; Gaskin, James; Galletta, Dennis F.; Humpherys, Sean; Barlow, Jordan B.; and Wilson, David W.  (2013). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2186798  Evaluating journal quality and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Senior Scholars’ journal basket via bibliometric measures: Do expert journal assessments add value?]," MIS Quarterly (MISQ), vol. 37(4), 993–1012. Also, see YouTube video narrative of this paper at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQIDkA-ke0&amp;feature=youtu.be.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, around the turn of the century, evaluation and ranking of scientists and institutions came more into the spotlights. Based on bibliometric analysis of scientific publications and citations, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] ("Shanghai ranking") was first published in 2004 by the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. Impact factors became an important tool to choose between different journals and the rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] (THE-ranking) became a leading indicator for the status of universities. The [[H-index|''h''-index]] became an important indicator of the productivity and impact of the work of a scientist. However, alternative author-level indicators has been proposed (see for example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Belikov, A.V. |author2=Belikov, V.V. | year = 2015 | title = A citation-based, author- and age-normalized, logarithmic index for evaluation of individual researchers independently of publication counts | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages= 884 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.7070.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Around the same time, interest of governments in evaluating research for the purpose of assessing the impact of science funding increased. As the investments in scientific research were included as part of the U.S. [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), a major economic stimulus package, programs like [[STAR METRICS]] were set up to assess if the positive impact on the economy would actually occur.&lt;ref name="Lane1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J | title = Assessing the Impact of Science Funding | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Methods of research include qualitative, quantitative and computational approaches.

One significant finding in the field is a principle of cost escalation to the effect that achieving further findings at a given level of importance grow exponentially more costly in the expenditure of effort and resources. However, new algorithmic methods in search, [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]] are showing that is not the case for many information retrieval and extraction-based problems. Related fields are the [[history of science and technology]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].

Journals in the field include ''[[Scientometrics (journal)|Scientometrics]], [[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'', and ''[[Journal of Informetrics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-informetrics/|title = Journal of Informetrics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics]] founded in 1993 is an association of professionals in the field.

'''Social research''' is a [[research]] conducted by [[social scientist]]s following a systematic plan. Social research methodologies can be classified as [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref&gt;Shackman, Gene. What is Program Evaluation, A Beginner's Guide. Module 3. Methods. The Global Social Change Research Project. 2009. Available at http://www.ideas-int.org. See Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create [[Validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]] general claims. Related to quantity.
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual subjective accuracy over generality. Related to quality.

While methods may be classified as quantitative or qualitative, most methods contain elements of both. For example, qualitative data analysis often involves a fairly structured approach to coding the raw data into systematic information, and quantifying intercoder reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth H. Bradley |author2=Leslie A. Curry |author3=Kelly J. Devers |title=Qualitative Data Analysis for Health Services Research: Developing Taxonomy, Themes, and Theory |journal=Health Serv Res |date=August 2007 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=1758–1772 |pmc=1955280 |pmid=17286625 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is often a more complex relationship between "qualitative" and "quantitative" approaches than would be suggested by drawing a simple distinction between them.

Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena: from [[census]] survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. Methods rooted in classical [[sociology]] and [[statistics]] have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as [[political science]], [[media studies]], [[program evaluation]] and [[market research]].

==Method==

Social scientists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the historical core of social theory ([[positivism]] and [[antipositivism]]; [[structure and agency]]). While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between [[social theory|theory]] and [[data]].&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Haralambos &amp; Holborn. ''Sociology: Themes and perspectives'' (2004) 6th ed, Collins Educational. {{ISBN|978-0-00-715447-0}}. Chapter 14: Methods&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individuals' [[social actions]] may choose ethnographic [[participant observation]] or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or ''[[triangulation (social science)|triangulate]]'', quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a multi-strategy design.

==Sampling==

Typically a population is very large, making a [[census]] or a complete [[enumeration]] of all the values in that population infeasible. A sample thus forms a manageable [[subset]] of a [[Statistical population|population]]. In positivist research, statistics derived from a sample are analysed in order to draw [[inference]]s regarding the population as a whole. The process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as ''[[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]''. Sampling methods may be either random ([[random sampling]], [[systematic sampling]], [[stratified sampling]], [[cluster sampling]]) or non-random/[[nonprobability sampling|nonprobability]] ([[convenience sampling]], [[purposive sampling]], [[snowball sampling]]).&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt; The most common reason for sampling is to obtain information about a population. Sampling is quicker and cheaper than a complete [[census]] of a population.

==Methodological assumptions==

Social research is based on [[logic]] and [[empirical]] [[Observation#The role of Observation in the Scientific Method|observation]]s. [[Charles C. Ragin]] writes in his ''Constructing Social Research'' book that "Social research involved the interaction between ideas and evidence. Ideas help social researchers make sense of evidence, and researchers use evidence to extend, revise and test ideas." Social research thus attempts to create or validate [[theory|theories]] through [[data collection]] and [[data analysis]], and its goal is exploration, description, [[explanation]], and [[prediction]]. It should never lead or be mistaken with [[philosophy]] or [[belief]]. Social research aims to find social patterns of regularity in social life and usually deals with [[social group]]s (aggregates of individuals), not individuals themselves (although science of [[psychology]] is an exception here). Research can also be divided into [[pure research]] and [[applied research]]. Pure research has no application on real life, whereas applied research attempts to influence the real world.

There are no laws in [[social science]] that parallel the [[Physical law|laws]] in [[natural science]]. A law in social science is a universal generalization about a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[fact]]s. A fact is an observed [[phenomenon]], and [[Observation#The role of Observation in the Scientific Method|observation]] means it has been seen, heard or otherwise experienced by researcher. A theory is a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of social life. [[Concept]]s are the basic building blocks of theory and are abstract elements representing classes of phenomena. [[Axiom]]s or [[postulate]]s are basic assertions assumed to be true. [[Proposition]]s are conclusions drawn about the relationships among concepts, based on analysis of axioms. [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] are specified expectations about [[empirical]] [[reality]] derived from propositions. Social research involves [[Hypothesis testing|testing]] these hypotheses to see if they are true.

Social research involves creating a theory, [[operationalization]] ([[measurement]] of variables) and [[observation]] (actual collection of [[data]] to test hypothesized relationship). Social theories are written in the language of variables, in other words, theories describe logical relationships between variables. Variables are logical sets of attributes, with people being the "carriers" of those variables (for example, [[gender]] can be a variable with two attributes: [[male]] and [[female]]). Variables are also divided into [[independent variable]]s (data) that influences the [[dependent variable]]s (which scientists are trying to explain). For example, in a study of how different dosages of a drug are related to the severity of symptoms of a disease, a measure of the severity of the symptoms of the disease is a dependent variable and the administration of the drug in specified doses is the independent variable. Researchers will compare the different values of the dependent variable (severity of the symptoms) and attempt to draw conclusions.

==Guidelines for "good research"==

When social scientists speak of "good research" the guidelines refer to how the science is mentioned and understood. It does not refer to how what the results are but how they are figured. [[Glenn Firebaugh]] summarizes the principles for good research in his book ''Seven Rules for Social Research''. The first rule is that "There should be the possibility of surprise in social research." As Firebaugh (p.&amp;nbsp;1) elaborates: "Rule 1 is intended to warn that you don't want to be blinded by preconceived ideas so that you fail to look for contrary evidence, or you fail to recognize contrary evidence when you do encounter it, or you recognize contrary evidence but suppress it and refuse to accept your findings for what they appear to say."

In addition, good research will "look for differences that make a difference" (Rule 2) and "build in reality checks" (Rule 3). Rule 4 advises researchers to replicate, that is, "to see if identical analyses yield similar results for different samples of people" (p.&amp;nbsp;90). The next two rules urge researchers to "compare like with like" (Rule 5) and to "study change" (Rule 6); these two rules are especially important when researchers want to estimate the effect of one variable on another (e.g. how much does college education actually matter for wages?). The final rule, "Let method be the servant, not the master," reminds researchers that methods are the means, not the end, of social research; it is critical from the outset to fit the research design to the research issue, rather than the other way around.

Explanations in social theories can be [[idiographic]] or [[nomothetic]]. An idiographic approach to an explanation is one where the scientists seek to exhaust the [[idiosyncratic]] causes of a particular condition or event, i.e. by trying to provide all possible explanations of a particular case. Nomothetic explanations tend to be more general with scientists trying to identify a few causal factors that impact a wide class of conditions or events. For example, when dealing with the problem of how people choose a job, idiographic explanation would be to list all possible reasons why a given person (or group) chooses a given job, while nomothetic explanation would try to find factors that determine why job applicants in general choose a given job.

Research in science and in social science is a long, slow and difficult process that sometimes produces false results because of methodological weaknesses and in rare cases because of fraud, so that reliance on any one study is inadvisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This was the biggest political science study of last year. It was a complete fraud.|url = https://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630535/same-sex-marriage-study|website = Vox|accessdate = 2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{further|Human subject research}}

The ethics of social research are shared with those of medical research. In the United States, these are formalized by the [[Belmont report]] as:

===Respect for persons===

The principle of respect for persons holds that (a) individuals should be respected as autonomous agents capable of making their own decisions, and that (b) subjects with diminished autonomy deserve special considerations.&lt;ref name="Belmont"&gt;{{cite web |title=Belmont report |publisher=The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research |date=April 18, 1979 |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405065531/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cornerstone of this principle is the use of [[informed consent]].

===Beneficence===

The principle of beneficence holds that (a) the subjects of research should be protected from harm, and, (b) the research should bring tangible benefits to society. By this definition, research with no scientific merit is automatically considered unethical.&lt;ref name="Belmont"/&gt;

===Justice===

The principle of justice states the benefits of research should be distributed fairly. The definition of fairness used is case-dependent, varying between "(1) to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4) to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each person according to merit."&lt;ref name="Belmont"/&gt;

==Foundations of social research==

===Sociological positivism===
The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while some scholars pinpoint the origin of [[demography]] to 1663 with the publication of [[John Graunt]]'s ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400906 ''The Founder of Statistics''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Social research began most intentionally, however, with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]] in the early 19th century.

[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Statistical sociological research, and indeed the formal academic discipline of [[sociology]], began with the work of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of [[Auguste Comte]]'s philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic. 1992. "Positivism". In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method|Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: {{nowrap|"[o]ur}} main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.&amp;nbsp;... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895. ''Rules of the Sociological Method''. Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or [[psychological]]) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''suis generis'' "[[social fact]]s" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is "healthy" or "pathological", and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] ''The Rules of Sociological Method'' 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E.&amp;nbsp;G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern methodologies===
In the early 20th century innovation in survey methodology were developed that are still dominant. In 1928, the psychologist [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] developed a method to select and score multiple items with which to measure complex ideas, such as attitudes towards religion. In 1932, the psychologist [[Rensis Likert]] developed the [[Likert scale]] where participants rate their agreement with statement using five options from totally disagree to totally agree. Likert like scales remain the most frequently used items in survey. 

In the mid-20th century there was a general—but not universal—trend for American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. [[Robert K. Merton]] released his ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] founded [[Columbia University]]'s [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]], where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the "founder of modern empirical sociology".&lt;ref name="Hynek"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeábek | first1 = Hynek | year = 2001 | title = Paul Lazarsfeld — The Founder of Modern Empirical Sociology: A Research Biography | url = | journal = International Journal of Public Opinion Research | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 229–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld made great strides in [[statistical survey]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld, P.&amp;nbsp;F., &amp; Henry, N.&amp;nbsp;W. (1966). ''Readings in mathematical social science''. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt; Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt;

==Terminology==
The term is derived from the [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] {{lang|la|peccatum Sodomiticum}} or "sin of Sodom", which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek word {{lang|grc|Σόδομα}} (Sódoma).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html myetymology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916041421/http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html |date=2012-09-16 }}, Sodomy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the "sinful" cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may "know" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the "messengers" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to "do worse" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, "so that they wearied themselves to find the door." (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])

In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v. Texas'' in which The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that sodomy laws are unconstitutional on June 26, 2003|author=|date=|website=cornell.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406071731/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cognates in other languages, such as [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|[[:fr:sodomie|sodomie]]}} (verb {{lang|fr|sodomiser}}), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|[[:es:sodomía|sodomía]]}} (verb {{lang|es|sodomizar}}), and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[:pt:sodomia|sodomia]]}} (verb {{lang|pt|sodomizar}}), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]—human sexuality and the anus—without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.

In modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word {{lang|no|[[:no:sodomi|sodomi]]}} carries both senses. In [[Danish language|Danish]], {{lang|da|[[:da:sodomi|sodomi]]}} is rendered as "unnatural [[carnal knowledge]] with [[Gay sexual practices|someone of the same sex]] or (now) with [[Zoophilia|animals]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=sodomi "Sodomi"] (''[[Ordbog over det danske Sprog]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], the word for sodomy,  {{lang|ar|لواط|rtl=yes}} (Arabic pronunciation: {{lang|ar-Latn|liwāṭ}}; Persian pronunciation {{lang|fa-Latn|lavât}}), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the [[Qur'an]]). Its direct reference is to [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]] (لوط ''Lūṭ'' in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is "the practice of Lot", but more accurately it means "the practice of Lot's people" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself.
 
The word ''[[wikt:sod#Etymology 2|sod]]'', a noun or verb (to "sod off") used as an insult, is derived from ''sodomite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Main Entry: sod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422175451/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;nowiki&gt;[3,noun]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that "an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction — and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction — appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, pp. 92–98&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.
Neither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.

Many times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.

Specific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).

In Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. "Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they." (v. 47, NASB) "Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49–50, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word "thus" is the conjunction "ו" which is usually translated "and", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)

There is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and "abomination" is used to describe many sins.

The [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as "There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel," but the word corresponding to "sodomite" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:קדש), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as "[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Roman Empire period===

==== New Testament ====
The [[New Testament]], like the [[Old Testament]], references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the [[Epistle of Jude]] provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed.

{{quotation|1=Jude 1:5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
&lt;br&gt;6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
&lt;br&gt;7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.|2=[[Authorized King James Version]]&lt;br&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Jude%201:7 Compare Jude 1:7 in multiple versions]}}

The Greek word in the New Testament from which the phrase is translated "giving themselves over to fornication", is "ekporneuō" ("ek" and "porneuō"). As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as "sexual immorality".

The Greek words for "strange flesh" are "heteros", which almost always basically denotes "another/other", and "sarx",  a common word for "flesh", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.

In the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall "filthy" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word ("aselgeiais") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).

====Epistle of Jude====
The [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: "just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered "sexual immorality and unnatural desire" is translated "strange flesh" or "false flesh", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.

One theory is that it is just a reference to the "strange flesh" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent's Word Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  "out of the order of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown&lt;/ref&gt; "Strange" is understood to mean "outside the moral law",&lt;ref&gt;Word pictures in the New Testament, Archibald Thomas Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bibleverse||Romans|7:3|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Galatians|1:6|KJV}}) while it is doubted that either Lot or the men of Sodom understood that the strangers were angels at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Gn. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philo====
The [[Hellenistic]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] [[Philo]] (20 BC - 50 AD)  described the inhabitants of Sodom in an extra biblical account:

"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them" (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo The works of Philo a contemporary of Josephius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119043027/http://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo |date=2016-01-19 }} Page 528&lt;/ref&gt;

====Josephus====
The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] used the term "Sodomites" in summarizing the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] narrative: "About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards [[God]], in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices" "Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed." (''Antiquities'' 1.11.1,3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216095250/http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |archivedate=2009-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — circa AD 96). His assessment goes beyond the Biblical data, though it is seen by conservatives as defining what manner of fornication (Jude 1:7) Sodom was given to.

===Medieval Christendom===
[[File:Dante sodom.jpg|thumb|[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] interview the sodomites, from {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido da Pisa|it}}'s commentary on the ''Commedia'', c. 1345]]

The primarily sexual meaning of the word ''sodomia'' for Christians did not evolve before the 6th century AD. [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], in his novels no. 77 (dating 538) and no. 141 (dating 559) amended to his [[Corpus iuris civilis]], and declared that Sodom's sin had been specifically same-sex activities and desire for them. He also linked "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences"  upon cities as being due to "such crimes",&lt;ref&gt;trans. in Derrick Sherwin Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, (London: Longmans, Green, 1955), 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; during a time of recent earthquakes and other disasters (see [[Extreme weather events of 535–536]]). He may have also used the anti-homosexual laws he enacted upon personal and political opponents, in case he could not prove them guilty of anything else.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm&lt;ref&gt;For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior. Individuals might ignore and escape secular laws, but they could not do the same with divine laws, if Justinian declared his novels to be such.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Christians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the 4th century regarded such as worse than murder in his fourth homily on {{bibleverse||Romans|1:26-27|KJV}} [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210204.htm], while [[Paul the Apostle]] in the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' referred to same sex relations as ''"shameful lust"'' and which acts were contrary to nature,  with men suffering a ''"due penalty"'' in their bodies. Just like the Jews, early Christians prior to Justinian I are not known to have used the word ''sodomia'' for the carnal sin they abhorred, though [[Philo of Alexandria]] (20 BC - 50 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Jewish philosopher, Writing on the life of Abraham&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methodius of Olympus]] (AD 260-312)&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the sin of Sodom&lt;/ref&gt; attributed homosexual relations to Sodom, as may have Josephus, (AD 37 – c. 100)&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities 1.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;33-34; ET Jonge 422-23; The Sodom tradition in Romans Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2004 by Philip F.

Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom may have been forgotten today (as some hold it had been, along with his law novellizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake [[Charlemagne|Charlemagnian]] [[capitularies]], fabricated by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita ("Benedict the Levite") around 850 AD, as part of the [[Pseudo-Isidore]]. Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:

It was in these fake capitularies where Benedictus utilized Justinian's interpretation as a justification for ecclesiastical supremacy over mundane institutions, thereby demanding{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} burning at the stake for carnal sins in the name of Charlemagne himself. Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[Nīþ|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.

Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.

Benedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. According to Benedictus, this was why all mundane institutions had to be subjected to ecclesiastical power in order to prevent moral as well as religious laxity causing divine wrath.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]
For delaying reasons described in the article [[Pseudo-Isidore]], but also because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.

This came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W. A. P.|authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning "of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials. The resulting infamy of sodomy motivated a continuing discrimination and persecution of homosexuals and sexual deviants in general long after the Medieval period had ended. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:

:"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers."
:"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them." ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])

[[File:Amsterdam sodomites 1730.png|thumb|upright|A [[wanted poster]], published in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in 1730, accusing ten men of "the abominable crime of sodomy" ({{lang|nl|de verfoeyelyke Crimen van Sodomie}})]]

An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the 18th century, sodomy was still theoretically a capital crime, and there are a handful of cases where sodomites were executed. However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}
[[File:Hangin outside Newgate Prison.jpg|left|thumb|An execution taking place outside Newgate Prison]]
Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}

In 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing. At least 60 men were sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm The Dutch Purge of Homosexuals 1730] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518101647/http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm |date=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern sodomy laws==
{{main|Sodomy law}}

===United States===
{{Main|Sodomy laws in the United States}}

In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy, and in 1986 the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting sodomy. However, state legislators and state courts had started to repeal or overturn their sodomy laws, beginning with Illinois in 1961, and thus in 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all sodomy, with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy.

On June 26, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in a 6–3 decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' struck down the [[Texas]] same-sex sodomy law, ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the [[Due process|due process clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], with [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s concurring opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. (''See [[Sodomy law]].)'' This decision invalidated all  [[U.S. state|state]] sodomy laws insofar as they applied to noncommercial conduct in private between consenting civilians and overruled its 1986 ruling in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' which upheld [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s sodomy law.

In the [[U.S. military]], the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], the statute banning sodomy.  In ''United States v. Stirewalt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in part and in the result): I agree with the result in this case but I "would reserve for another day the questions of whether and how ''Lawrence'' [''v. Texas'', 539 U.S. 558 (2003)] applies to the military. "1  ''Like United States v. Marcum'', "the factual differences between Lawrence and Appellant's case are striking" for the reasons mentioned by the majority as well as the circumstances surrounding the charges themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|title=U.S. v. Stirewalt|author=|date=|website=www.armfor.uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525185749/http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|archivedate=25 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stirewalt's conviction of sodomy stood due to the circumstances surrounding the crime. The court went on to say that despite ''Lawrence''{{'}}s application to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" which would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm|title=U.S. v.

''United States v. Meno'' and ''United States v. Bullock'' are two known cases in which consensual sodomy convictions have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' precedent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldn.org/binary-data/SLDN_ARTICLES/pdf_file/2309.pdf United States v.

==Religions==
Views on sodomy in some contemporary [[world religion]]s.

===Judaism===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw ''good''.
:— [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]], {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49-50|KJV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical Jewish texts are seen by many as not stressing the homosexual aspect of the attitude of the inhabitants of Sodom as much as their cruelty and lack of [[hospitality]] to the "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 2 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah|author=|date=|website=rictornorton.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608042052/http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century Jewish scholar [[Nachmanides]] wrote, "According to our sages, they were notorious for every evil, but their fate was sealed for their persistence in not supporting the poor and the needy." His contemporary Rabbenu Yonah expresses the same view: "Scripture attributes their annihilation to their failure to practice ''[[tzedakah]]'' [charity or justice]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|title=Tzedakah Activists Vs. Sodomites|author=|date=|website=www.shemayisrael.co.il|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813013341/http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Prohibitions on same-sex activities among men (#157) and bestiality (#155–156) are among the [[613 commandments]] as listed by [[Maimonides]] in the 12th century; however, their source in [[Leviticus 18]] does not contain the word ''sodomy''. The idea that homosexual intercourse was involved as at least a part of the evil of Sodom arises from the story in [[Genesis 19]] (NIV):

{{quote|Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:4-7|KJV;NIV|Gen.19:4&amp;ndash;7 compare}}) 
The Hebrew verb used is ''to know'', which can have a sexual meaning in the Bible, but doesn't always, and might have a sexual meaning here, judging from Lot's shocked reaction:
"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing&amp;nbsp;..."}}

===Christianity===
The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice'', pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf Gagnon, ''Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice'', pp. 46–50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512090559/http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the Sodom narrative with [[Leviticus 18]], which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being "defiled":

{{quote|for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled; otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.}}

Some scholars, such as Per-Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture.

Others, the earliest of whom was [[D.S. Bailey|Derrick Sherwin Bailey]], claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. In their view the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of [[hospitality]] laws than sexual sins.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'' (Hamden: Conn.: Archon, 1975 reprint from 1955), 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Destruction of Sodom|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad (Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement)|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402022353/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary word in contention is the Hebrew word ''yâda‛'' used for ''know'' in the Old Testament. Biblical scholars disagree on what "know" in this instance refers to, but most of conservative Christianity interprets it to mean "sexual intercourse",&lt;ref&gt;Greg Bahnsen, ''Homosexuality: A Biblical View'' (Phillipsburg: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing, 1978), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology'', by Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges&lt;/ref&gt; while the opposing position interprets it to mean "interrogate."&lt;ref&gt;John J. McNeil, ''The Church and the Homosexual'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to "know" by sexual intercourse.

Those who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (yâda‛) for "know" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the [[Septuagint]] it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''yâda‛'' denoting sex is in Genesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja&lt;/ref&gt; (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning. Its use in the parallel story in Judges 19 is also invoked in support of this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Sodom: Inhospitality or Homosexuality?'', by Dave Miller, Ph.D., Apologetics Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James B. DeYoung, ''Homosexuality'', pp. 118–122&lt;/ref&gt; with it otherwise providing the only instance of "knowing" someone by violence.

===Islam===
While the [[Quran]] clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the "people of Lot" ("What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?"&lt;ref&gt;Sura 26:165–167, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;), only one passage can be interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities:

{{quote|As for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both; and if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo, God is relenting, merciful.&lt;ref&gt;Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
[[Hadith]] (reports of [[Muhamma]]d's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with different writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Wafer, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shariah]] (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.&lt;ref name="Jong"&gt;Jivraj &amp; de Jong, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and an increasing number of Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance.&lt;ref name="Jong"/&gt; For sodomy within marriage, the majority of [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not ''haram'' (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|title=Chapter Three: The Islamic Sexual Morality (2) Its Structure|author=|date=|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016184024/http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation in Muslim societies]] and the strong emphasis on virility leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt &amp; Sofer, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sodomy is homosexual, but for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report the demand for anal penetration from their male clients.&lt;ref&gt;Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fairground Park Riot''' was a [[Ethnic conflict|race riot]] that broke out on June 21, 1949 at a newly integrated public swimming pool.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;Eddie Silva, "The Longest Day," Riverfront Times,  October 25, 2016, http://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-longest-day/Content?oid=2469321&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Fairground Pool, in St. Louis [[Missouri]], was one of the largest pools in the [[American Midwest]] measuring 440 feet. The pool was able to hold from 10,000 to 12,000 swimmers at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"June 21, 1949-Race Riot Over Pool Integration in St. Louis Missouri,"legallegacy.worldpress.com, last modified June 21, 2016, https://legallegacy.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/june-21-1949-race-riot-over-pool-integration-in-st-louis-missouri/&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period much of the country was suffering from segregation. Missouri was among one of the states that was still segregated. Pickets had been put up at the Fairground Park to protest the segregation of pools. At the time; however, the federal law did not support segregation of public facilities.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; O'Toole, who at the time made the decision regarding the pools and parks, realized that the pools could not continue to be segregated. He said, "I can't oppose anyone from lawfully using a swimming pool. They are taxpayers and citizens, too."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; On June 21, 1949, African Americans were allowed access to the city pool for the first time. Until that day, the Fairground Park swimming pool was only open to white patrons. On the first day that it was open to African Americans too, only 30 to 40 African Americans showed up. They swam alongside white children without any problem until a group of white teenagers surrounded the fence that enclosed the pool and began to shout threats to the African American swimmers. The black children had to be taken to a changing room until they could be escorted out by police. Some eye witness reports contradict each other some saying that the children were not placed in harm's way, while others say that the police escorts did not stop the white teenagers from physically attacking the black children. Some witnesses reported that by 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day the crowd escalated to several hundred and of those people only 20 to 30 were African American. The riot escalated rapidly when a rumor got around that a black man had killed a white man. The black boys were surrounded by the white boys who had arrived with baseball bats. It appeared that one of the boys even had a knife. One of the African American children was beat until an officer fell on top of him to stop the white child from attacking him.  By now, the crowd had turned into thousands. Approximately 150 police officers were at the scene. By 10 o'clock that night, the situation mellowed down; however, the crowd did not fully disappear until after midnight. To avoid another eruption, the mayor decided that the best decision would be to segregate the pools again.&lt;ref name=Phillip&gt;Phillip O'Connor, "Pool riot pivotal in race relations City's decision in '49 to integrate swimming pools sparked violence that triggered change." St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 21, 2009, http://www.stltoday.com/news/pool-riot-pivotal-in-race-relations-city-s-decision-in/article_914ec52e-4be8-5b09-ac98-e71da7160cc6.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 1950, it was ordered by the federal court to integrate the pools of St. Louis.

== Through Robert Gammon &amp; J.C. Tobias Eyes ==
When the race riot occurred, Robert Gammon was only a teenager. All he wanted to do wash cool down at the Fairground Park swimming pool. Sixty years later, he can still remember the fear he endured. He remembers the taunts, the bricks, and the fights. When he heard the radio announcement that the pool would be open for blacks as well, he did not think it would cause such backlash. For the longest time, all he wanted to do was swim in the outdoor pool that had the wooden diving platform. However, he had never experienced such fear as he did when he headed home that night. When he along with the other black kids were escorted to the changing room, he remembers a white woman spitting at him. Once the police escorts separated, Gammon and his friends were chased by whites to St. Louis Avenue before giving up. He even recalls one of his friends getting hit in the head by a brick that was thrown at him. After the riot, he felt that it would be a long time before he could trust white people again. He said, "I thought all white people hated us."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; To this day Gammon cannot understand why the riot happened. He wonders, "Just because I'm black?" He remembers the crowds continuing to get larger and larger as the day went on and more fights kept breaking out. Time magazine published an article about the riot in the days following the riot and described the scene as, "Negro boys were chased and beaten by white gangs. In the gathering dusk, one grown-up rabble-rouser spoke out. 'Want to know how to take care of those niggers?' he shouted. 'Get bricks. Smash their heads, the dirty, filthy "-".'" &lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; Years later Gammon visited the Fairground Park and leaned against the fence that once had enclosed the original pool. As the years have gone by, he does not see race the same way. He does not continue to hold the belief that all whites hate him; however, he does wish that the whole incident would have never happened. In his eyes, he sees things are better nowadays, but the issue is still prevalent and there is still progress to be made.  J.C. Tobias recalls being chased by a mob of white teenagers when he and some friends were walking back home from the park's baseball diamond. He said, "When you're a kids, you don't think much about it. As you age, you realize it didn't make much sense. We were just up there to swim."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; J.C. Tobias was just a teenager when the riot occurred and sixty years later he still has a vivid recollection of the event.

== The Other Side ==
Star-Times' also made a report about the riot. The report included what one middle-aged man at the riot said. According to the report, the man said, "Kill a nigger and make a name for yourself," the other man said.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; "Kill the black bastards." &lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Star Times' even included a photograph of white mothers carrying their young children along with them to miss the excitement. White teenagers went around with their weapons. They carried with them baseball bats and broom sticks. One reporter stated that they overheard one of the white teenagers say, "This is a waiting party. Waiting until it gets dark," and another white teenager replied with, "I'll kill the bastards."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Someone from the crowd spotted some African Americans and shouted, "There's some niggers!"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Like a swarm of ants, the proceeded towards the African American boys and surrounded them. They saw an African American boy pull a knife and they began to attack him. They used their clubs, bats, sticks, and their fist to attack the young boy. Despite police effort to protect the boy, the whites continued to attack him as he laid on the ground.

== Forgotten history ==
In Eddie Silva's, "The Longest Day,"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; he shares his feeling about the race riot and believes that the race riot "has been erased from the city's collective memory."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; This part of history is overlooked and not talked about because it forces the people to confront the city's racial divisions. Silva believes that ignoring the riot does not change that fact that it happened and it is something that needs receive the attention it deserves because its effects still continue currently. Some choose to forget or not believe that on the night of the riot approximately 4,000 to 5,000 whites roamed the grounds of the Fairground Park and assaulted any and every African American that crossed their path.&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the nearly twelve hours and 400 officers it took to restore order, there were over a dozen people injured and at least eight were arrested.&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; No deaths resulted in the melee, however, ten black people and two white people were hospitalized for injuries sustained in the event. Official reports state that out of the seven people that were arrested that day, three were white and four were black. Of those seven however, three blacks and one white was ultimately arrested and charged with initiating the riot.&lt;ref&gt;Landon Jones, "Echoes of Michael Brown's Death in St. Louis's Racially Charged Past," The Atlantic, August 12, 2014,  https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/how-an-integrated-swimming-pool-incited-race-riots-in-st-louis/375943/&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at the Fairground Park Pool dropped so significantly that it no longer made a profit and ultimately was closed down.

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997.

==Background and overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Primitive Hut''' is a concept that explores the origins of architecture and its practice. The concept explores the [[anthropological]] relationship between man and the natural environment as the fundamental basis for the creation of architecture. The idea of The Primitive Hut contends that the ideal architectural form embodies what is natural and intrinsic.

The Primitive hut as an architectural theory was brought to life over the mid-1700s till the mid-1800s, theorised in particular by ([[Abbot|''Abbé'']]) [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]. Laugier provided an allegory of a man in nature and his need for shelter in ''An Essay on Architecture'' that formed an underlying structure and approach to architecture and its practice. This approach has been explored in architectural theory to speculate on a possible destination for architecture as a discipline.  The essay was arguably one of the first significant attempts to theorise architectural knowledge both scientifically and philosophically.  
                                                                
== Origins of The Primitive Hut: ''Essai sur L'Architecture'' (''Essay on Architecture),'' 1755 ==

''The Essay on Architecture'' was first published by Marc-Antoine Laugier in 1753. It was written in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of enlightenment]], during a time characterised by rationalist thinking through science and reason. Architecture in France during this period was defined predominantly by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style  with its excessive ornamentation and religious [[iconography]]. Rather than being concerned with the search for meaning and the over analysis of the [[Representation (arts)|representational elements]] of architecture, Laugier's essay proposed that the idea of noble and formal architecture was found in what was necessary for architecture, not in its ornamentation but in its [[Truth|true]] underlying fundamentals. Laugier argued for the simplicity of architecture, that architecture must return to its origins, the simple rustic hut.

It was through The Primitive Hut that Laugier sought to explain his philosophy of architecture. The ''Essay on Architecture'' provides what Laugier explains as the general rules of architecture: the 'true principles', the 'invariable rules'; for 'directing the judgement and forming the taste of the gentleman and the architect'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To Laugier, The Primitive Hut was the highest virtue that architecture should achieve.

=== The frontispiece illustration ===

An illustration of the primitive hut by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Dominique Eisen]] was the frontispiece for the second edition of Laugier's ''Essay on Architecture (1755)''. The frontispiece was arguably one of the most famous images in the history of architecture, it helped to make the essay more accessible and consequently it was more widely received by the public. The message the illustration was suggesting was clear; that the essay would suggest a new direction or a new order for architecture. In the image a young woman who personifies architecture draws the attention of an angelic child towards the primitive hut. Architecture is pointing to a new structural clarity found in nature, rather than the ironic ruins of the past.

=== Premise ===

''The Essay on Architecture'' provides a story of man in his 'primitive' state to explain how the creation of the "primitive man's" house is created instinctively based on mans need to shelter himself from nature. Laugier believed that the model of the primitive man's hut provided the ideal principles for architecture or any structure. It was from this perspective that Laugier formed his general principles of architecture where he outlined the standard form of architecture and what he believed was fundamental to all architecture. To Laugier, the general principles of architecture were found in what was natural, intrinsic and part of natural processes.

=== Outline ===

Laugier's ''Essay on Architecture'' is divided into six chapters that focus on the different constituencies and considerations of architecture.  It methodically identifies the key components of a building, describes their fundamental importance and how they should be approached.

In Chapter 1: "The General Principles of Architecture", Laugier divides and analyses buildings into five main "articles": the [[column]], [[entablature]], [[pediment]], the different [[storey]]s of architecture, the [[window]]s and [[door]]s. In Article 1, for example, Laugier makes four general rules for the construction of columns, one of them being that the column "must be strictly perpendicular, because being intended to support the whole load, perfect verticality gives it its greatest strength."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Essay on Architecture|last=Laugier|first=M. A.|publisher=T. Osbourne and Shipton|year=1755|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Laugier, these articles emphasised the fundamental components of a building and what he identifies as their core necessities - that is, The Primitive Hut model. Laugier emphasised the point that nature provides the rules for architecture.

Laugier used the frontispiece to illustrate that typically architecture needs only three main elements, the free-standing columns, horizontal beams (entablature), and a simple pediment (the triangular end of a pitched roof).

Laugier also noted that the deviation or misuse of the principles lead to inherent faults in typical buildings and in architectural practice. In particular he recognised logical faults, issues such as proportion and unintelligent design. Instead, advocating that "by approaching the simplicity of the model, fundamental mistakes are avoided and true perfection achieved".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea also claims that Ancient Greek temples owed their form to the earliest habitations erected by man. In the primitive hut, the horizontal beam was supported by tree trunks planted upright in the ground and the roof was sloped to shed rainwater. This was an extension of the primitive hut concept and the inspiration behind the basic [[Doric order]].

The essay advocates that architecture approach perfection through the search for absolute beauty, specifically by returning to the hypothetical original hut as a model for building.

== Contribution to architectural theory ==

The Primitive Hut made an important contribution to the theory of architecture. It marked the beginning of a significant analysis and debate within architectural theory, particularly between [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] schools of thought. While previously the field of architecture concerned the search for the ideal building form through truth in building, the primitive hut questioned the universal in architecture. It was through the reading of the Laugier Essay questioned the fundamental and the universal requirements of architecture, the text marked a new field of inquiry into the field of architecture that changed the understandings and the approach to architecture. In particular, there were the beginnings of an attempt to understand the various individual components of architecture.

The Primitive Hut is an a-historical point of reference that is not necessarily a historical object that is investigated through speculation or an archaeological investigation. The Primitive Hut was instead a self-evident realisation that created a new perspective of architectural inquiry. Architectural inquiry would be engaged to justify the validity of the primitive hut model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucas/legitimacy-of-architecture/project/the-primitive-hut.html|title=The Idea of the Primitive Hut|last=|first=|date=15 March 2013|website=The Legitimacy of Architecture 1750-1850|publisher=Universiteit Leiden|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of The Primitive Hut have conceptually been linked to the Old Testament and the story of [[Adam and Eve]], and of other primitive cultures. The classical orders in the stories about primitive dwellings are often the subject of analysis to trace the history of the primitive hut, these have arguably been traced back to the works of Vitruvius and [[De architectura|''The Ten Books on Architecture'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Adams House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History|last=Rykwert|first=Joseph|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|year=1972|isbn=0870705121|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tracings work to validate The Primitive Hut model.

Scientific and philosophical approaches have led to various branches of inquiry that question both the origins and the possible destinations of architecture. These have been recognised across a range of different cultures. These different approaches have led to various conceptualisations that question cultural differences and attempt to define the ideal principles of architecture and of the primitive hut specifically.

The Primitive hut is a conceptual hut, that is not necessarily a material and physical hut. It is an abstract concept of a place that is created through mans response to the natural environment, where architecture acts as the mediator between man and nature. The Primitive hut concept explores how architecture came to be, and is a way of explaining the fundamental origins of architecture. The Primitive hut provides a point of reference for all speculation on the essentials of building and represents arguably the first architectural 'idea'.

The Primitive Hut concept also suggests that the natural environment provides the solutions for this ideal architectural form. Understandings of [[vernacular architecture]] have often had a major influence on the understandings of the Primitive Hut, as they often provide a different point of origin for a potential direction for architecture. Rather than focusing on the meanings that are associated with the building and its components, the Primitive Hut questions the fundamental components that are universal in architecture.

=== Themes ===

Theory surrounding The Primitive Hut covers a number of key themes:                                           
* To present rites where a "primitive hut" has either been built ritually and at seasonal intervals, or deliberately in a "primitive" state for analogous ritual purposes.                                                                       
* To show how the idea of the primitive hut became a vehicle for architectural theories from the fifteenth century on.                                                                        
* To suggest that the "primitive hut will retain its validity as a reminder of the original and therefore essential meaning of all building for people: that is, of architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Germann|first=G|title=Review: On Adams House in Paradise; The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History by Joseph Rykwert|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=Vol. 33, No. 3, Oct., 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of primitive huts ==
The primitive hut has been theorised to have different forms:                                          
# The purely historical object that has been abandoned to construct better huts.                                          
# The hut reconstructed in people's imagination.                                          
# The anthropological hut, an existing hut that is analysed to rediscover the universal elements of architecture.                                          
# The primitive hut as a place that continuously reoccurs whenever a building is created both consciously and unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=T|year=2009|title=Benoit Goetz: A French reader of Rykwerts On Adams House in Paradise|journal=Interstices, A Journal of Architecture and Related Arts|volume=10|pages=87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threats to sea turtles''' are numerous and have caused many [[sea turtle]] species to be endangered. Of the seven extant species of sea turtles, six in the family Cheloniidae and one in the family Dermochelyidae, all are listed on the [[IUCN Red List of Endangered Species]]. The list classifies six species of sea turtle as "threatened", two of them as "critically endangered", one as "endangered" and three as "vulnerable". The [[flatback sea turtle]] is classified as "data deficient" which means that there is insufficient information available for a proper assessment of conservation status.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2018. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 3.1. &lt;http://www.iucnredlist.org&gt;. 11 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Although sea turtles usually lay around one hundred eggs at a time, on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Sara. "Hilton Head Island sees record sea turtle nesting season." Bluffton Today (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.blufftontoday.com/news/2010-08-06/hilton-head-island-sees-record-sea-turtle-nesting-season&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the things that endanger these hatchlings are natural, such as predators including sharks, raccoons, foxes, and seagulls,&lt;ref&gt;"Natural ." Sea Turtle Foundation. Sea Turtle Foundation, 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.seaturtlefoundation.org/threats/natural/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; many new threats to the sea turtle species have recently arrived and increased with the ever-growing presence of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, Michael, Aaron Wirsing, Jordan Thomson, and Derek Burkholder. "A review of lethal and non-lethal effects of predators on adult marine turtles." ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'' 356.1-2 (2008): 43-51. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial lighting==

One of the greatest threats to the survival of hatchlings is [[lighting|artificial lighting]].  When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="Lohmann, Catherine 2006"&gt;Lohmann, Catherine, and Kenneth Lohmann. "Sea turtles ." ''Current Biology'' 16.18 (2006): R784-R786. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially.  With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle’s natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest  thing of light.  With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused and turned around, few of them making successful treks to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Marc. "The Biogeography of Leatherback Turtles." San Francisco State University. San Francisco State University, Nov 2002. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/fall02%20projects/leatherback.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies support artificial light as the leading cause for hatchling disorientation, showing that in 1999, 51% of the nests studied showed signs of confusion with one-fourth of all the hatchlings headed in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Mark. "Light Pollution and Marine Turtle Hatchlings: The Straw that Breaks the Camel's Back?." ''The George Wright Forum''. The George Wright Society, 2001. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	As artificial lighting has been shown to be significantly harmful to the offspring of sea turtles, there have been several large-scale conservation efforts by Marine Life programs and conservation groups like  that continue to educate the public on turtle conservation.  Communities situated on or near a beach have been warned of the effects excessive lighting has on sea turtles and there has been substantial attempts to darken beaches and replace harmful artificial lighting with turtle-safe lights.  Some entire communities have adopted official sea turtle protection regulations, such as Florida’s “Lights-out” policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Fredrica. "Saving Sea Turtles with a Lights-Out Policy in Florida." ''National Geographic News''10 Mar. 2003: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0310_030310_turtlelight_2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic interference==

Ferrous metal wire mesh screens are commonly used to protect sea turtle nests from predators' excavating and devouring the eggs and hatchlings.  A new concern is that nestlings' delicate magnetic sense may not develop normally in the presence of the magnetic field interference from                                                    these steel mesh cages.  The effects of the use of steel mesh as a cage material may not be known for many years until assessments can be made of the success rate of the first adult populations that developed within such cages begin attempting landfall for nest-making.  Gravid turtles or their hatchlings may also be affected by the presence of magnetic fields arising from power cables, iron debris,  steel seawalls or other human activities that locally modify earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Lohmann, Catherine 2006"/&gt;

==Oil spills and marine pollution==
[[File:Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation.jpg|thumb|An oiled Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]
[[Marine pollution]] is both directly harmful to sea turtles as well as indirectly, through the deterioration of their natural habitats.  Some of the most dangerous ocean pollutants include [[toxic metal]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, untreated waste, [[chemical substance|chemicals]], and a variety of [[petroleum]] products. [[Oil spill]]s are particularly dangerous to sea turtles.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles"&gt;"Sea Turtle Threats: Oil Spills." ''Sea Turtle Conservancy'' (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=oilspills&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;   Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can get in their eyes, skin, and lungs which can lead to significant health problems.  Even if they are not directly in contact with marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat.  Oil is also a cause for the death of [[seagrass]], which is a large staple in the diet of the green turtle.  The diets of the [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[loggerhead sea turtle]], and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]] species have also been affected by the oil’s role in the reduction of certain [[sponges]] and [[invertebrates]].   Extended exposure has been found to deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other threats.&lt;ref name="Milton, Sarah 2010"&gt;Milton, Sarah, and Peter Lutz. United States. ''Oil and Sea Turtles Biology, Planning, and Response''.  2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, formerly known as the Caribbean Conservation Program, the [[animal migration|migration]] habits of sea turtles increase their exposure to marine pollution at each of the stages of their lives including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub adults, or nesting adults.   A 1994 study off of Florida’s Atlantic coast, 63% of hatchlings surveyed had been found to have ingested tar.  Loggerheads in particular have been shown to have the most problems with [[tarball (oil)|tarball]] ingestion, leading to [[esophagus|esophageal]] swelling that can dislocate the intestines and liver leading to serious [[buoyancy]] issues as well as excessive swelling.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles" /&gt; Many regions heavily associated with oil, either exploration, transportation, or processing, are also significant sea turtle environments, including the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]], and particularly the coasts of Texas and Florida.&lt;ref name="Milton, Sarah 2010"/&gt; Sea turtles existing in the exact areas where oil spills occur are not the only ones at risk due to the strong and far reaching ocean currents which can move pollution to great distances from its derivation.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, B.E. "Ecology of neonate loggerhead turtles inhabiting lines of downwelling near a Gulf Stream front." ''Sea Turtle Conservancy '' (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Breeding season is in particular a dangerous time for sea turtles due to the pollution of beach nesting sites.&lt;ref&gt;Antworth, Rebecca, David Pike, and John Stiner. "Nesting ecology, current status, and conservation of sea turtles on an uninhabited beach in Florida, USA." ''Biological Conservation'' 130.1 (2006): 10-15. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contamination of their diet can lead to disruption of digestion as well as physical injury of the sea turtles’ digestive tracts.  The nesting of female sea turtles is often deterred due to the potential of oily effluence.&lt;ref name="conserveturtles" /&gt;  If the female does lay eggs, the development of the eggs is still at risk due to either oil in the sand or contamination from the mother turtle that was oiled while nesting.  If the eggs in the nest have contact with oil while in the last half of their [[egg incubation|incubation phase]], the rate of hatchling survival sharply decreases and those that do survive have a greater chance of physical deformities.&lt;ref&gt;United States. ''Impacts of Oil on Marine Mammals and Sea Turtles'', 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean plastic==
Discarded plastic bags floating in the ocean resemble jellyfish, a common food of sea turtles. If a turtle eats a plastic foil, it tends to clog the turtle's digestive system and results in the animal dying. There have been many cases of dissection showing plastic foil and other debris inside turtles stomachs and intestines.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.seaturtle.org/imagelib/?cat=663&amp;thumb=1 Pictures of plastic items eaten by turtles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Owing to the popularity of numerous sea turtle species, people often travel to areas where the turtles nest or live to observe and photograph them. This has resulted in numerous deaths of the turtles through boat collisions, tourists attempting to catch or steal individuals, and other incidents. In [[Costa Rica]], tourists have recently been criticised for interfering with the nesting habits of the resident [[Olive ridley sea turtle]]s, disrupting and confusing the animals by attempting to take [[selfie]]s with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/selfie-taking-tourists-threaten-sea-turtle-population-in-costa-rica-1.3237329|title=Selfie-taking tourists threaten sea turtle population in Costa Rica  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boats ==
[[File:Manatee_bearing_scars_on_back_from_boat_propeller.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manatee_bearing_scars_on_back_from_boat_propeller.jpg|thumb|Image of a manatee with boat strike injuries. Similar injuries occur on turtle with parallel cuts (as shown in the image) or by blunt force trauma.]]
There are numerous threats to sea turtles associated with boats including: [[Oil spill|oil spills,]] [[habitat degradation]], and vessel collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology of Sea Turtles|last=Lutcavage|first=ME|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=388-404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boat strike injuries result in two types of injuries: blunt force trauma and propeller slices in the [[carapace]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=George|date=2012|title=Boat strikes: A threat to the Suwannee Cooter (Pseudemys concinna suwanniensis)|url=|journal=Herpetological Conservation and Biology|volume=7|pages=349-357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blunt force trauma is from the hull of the boat hitting the turtle. Blunt force trauma results in a cracking, less obvious, injury on the turtle's [[carapace]]. Propeller strikes form clear cut, parallel lines on the carapace of the turtle. The [[propeller]] wounds can cut into the spinal cord or lungs if deep enough, as these are located dorsally on the animal attached to the underside of the [[carapace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anatomy of Sea Turtle|last=Wyneken|first=J|publisher=U.S. Departments of Commerce NOAA Technnical Memorandum NMFS-SEFSC-470|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea turtle stranding data is the primary method of quantifying boat strike injuries, which has increased by 20% in [[Florida]] between 1985 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singel|first=K|date=2007|title=Navigating Florida’s waterways: boat related strandings of marine turtles in Florida|url=|journal=Proceeding of the 27th Annual Symposium on Sea Turtle Biology and Conservation.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, sea turtles are not able to avoid boat collisions when boats are travelling too quickly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazel|first=Julia|date=2007|title=Vessel speed increases collision risk for the green turtle Chelonia mydas|url=|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=3|pages=105-113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the faster a boat is travelling the more damage is done to the turtle, making incidents more lethal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Work|first=Paul A.|last2=Sapp|first2=Adam L.|last3=Scott|first3=David W.|last4=Dodd|first4=Mark G.|date=2010|title=Influence of small vessel operation and propulsion system on loggerhead sea turtle injuries|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2010.07.019|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=393|issue=1-2|pages=168–175|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2010.07.019|issn=0022-0981|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When sea turtles surface to breathe they continue swimming in the water column just below the surface, this allows them to get a few breathes in at a time, and then dive into deeper water to hunt or [[forage]]. This depth is the ideal depth for the propeller of the boat to hit the turtle, it also makes it even more difficult for boaters to try and avoid the turtle, since they can't be seen.

There are ways to mitigate the problem. Speed reduction zones have been beneficial for species such as the [[Florida Manatee|Florida manatee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laist|first=David W.|last2=Shaw|first2=Cameron|date=2006|title=PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT BOAT SPEED RESTRICTIONS REDUCE DEATHS OF FLORIDA MANATEES|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00027.x|journal=Marine Mammal Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=472–479|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00027.x|issn=0824-0469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones would be especially important implemented in shallow, [[Coast|coastal]] regions near popular nesting beaches during nesting season. Vessel modification are another way that boaters can reduce their influence on marine life. Jet board motors have an impeller that eliminates the threat of propeller damage to marine turtles. The motor rests only a few inches from the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of the boat, meaning it is less likely to hit turtles that are not surfacing to breathe. Propeller guards are slightly helpful at idle speeds, but once a boat begins to reach higher planing speeds they are ineffective in protecting the turtle from the propeller. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sea turtles that strand alive with boat injuries can be treated at rehabilitation facilities. Treatment is not always successful, but there are turtles that do survive boat strike injuries. 

==Fishing==
According to an article in AAAS &amp; Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died over the past twenty years due to injuries caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats.&lt;ref name="news.sciencemag.org"&gt;Stokstad, Erik. "Sea Turtles Suffer Collateral Damage From Fishing." ''Science AAAS'' 07 Apr 2010: n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/sea-turtles-suffer-collateral-da.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310111027/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/sea-turtles-suffer-collateral-da.html |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fisheries]] often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark.  What is known as “[[bycatch]]” is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name="news.sciencemag.org"/&gt; [[longline fishing|Longline]], [[trawling|trawl]],&lt;ref&gt;Sasso, Christopher, and Sheryan Epperly. "Seasonal sea turtle mortality risk from forced submergence in bottom trawls." ''Fisheries Research'' 81.1 (2006): 86-88. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gillnet]] fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea turtle accidents.  Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come up for air.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Heather, Erin LaCasella, Robin LeRoux, Henry Miliken, and Brett Hayward. "Characteristics of sea turtles incidentally captured in the U.S. Atlantic sea scallop dredge fishery." ''Fisheries Research'' 93.3 (2008): 289-295. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital organs and intestines.&lt;ref&gt;Viegas, Jennifer. "Millions of Sea Turtles Captured, Killed by Fisheries." ''Discovery News'' (2010): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://news.discovery.com/animals/turtles-bycatch-fishing.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poaching==

In many countries sea turtles are captured, killed, and traded for their meat, shells and for their leather flippers.   Eggs are also at risk of [[poaching]] and are commonly eaten by humans and are considered a delicacy in certain cultures.  Other cultures believe sea turtle eggs to be [[aphrodisiac]]s, while others claim that eating them yields longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Rhett. "Sex sells sea turtle conservation in Mexico." Environmental News August 19, 2005: n. pag. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://news.mongabay.com/2005/0819-turtles.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In some islands, parts of the sea turtle are used in ceremonies and are considered sacred.  Other times, the carcasses harvested are made into jewelry, instruments, souvenirs, sunglasses, or wall decorations, especially of the Hawksbill variety which are desired for the striking details of the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guern Lytle, Claire. "Sea Turtle Egg Poaching Legalized in Costa Rica: The Debate ." Coastal Care. N.p., n.d. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://coastalcare.org/2011/07/legalized-poaching-turtles-eggs-and-playa-ostional-costa-rica/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==
[[File:Climate March 0841 (34210334302).jpg|thumb|Placard "I speak for the sea turtles", at the [[People's Climate March (2017)]].]]

[[Global warming]] is estimated to have serious effects on wildlife over the next few decades. There is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. With the increase of temperature, [[polar ice cap|polar ice]] has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. Global warming has been associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that [[coastal erosion|erode beaches]] and flood nests.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Warming." SEE Turtles. N.p., 2007. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.seeturtles.org/1380/global-warming.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224021856/http://www.seeturtles.org/1380/global-warming.html# |date=2010-12-24 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. Water that is too warm can also cause [[coral bleaching]], which is detrimental to [[reefs]] that are essential to certain species, such as the Hawksbill sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, Sean. "Global Warming Has Devastating Effect on Coral Reefs, Study Shows." National Geographic News 28 Oct 2010: n. pag. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/warming-coral.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[File:Turtlewithfptumors0149026.jpg|thumb|right|A sea turtle with [[fibropapillomatosis]].]]
A disease known as [[fibropapillomatosis]] manifests itself in turtles through external [[tumor]]s.  These tumors often grow to be so large that they hinder a sea turtle’s ability to see, eat, and swim, therefore rendering the sea turtle unable to survive.  Inexplicably, the majority of the cases of fibropapillomatosis have been diagnosed in the [[green sea turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'') while none have been in the [[leatherback sea turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea'').  Cases of this disease have been found in all major oceans.  Although the causes of this disease are not clear, many believe the source to be [[virus|viral]].  These tumors are either smooth or contain pointed projections and they are red, pink, grey, black, or purple in color. These tumors are usually located anywhere on the soft skin tissue of the sea turtle, either the neck, eyes, or bottom of the flippers and range in size anywhere from a pea to a grapefruit.&lt;ref&gt;Florida. ''Fibropapillomatosis and its effect on green turtles'', 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts and rehabilitation centers==

A study by Discovery News targets the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the Eastern [[Pacific]], the Southwest [[Atlantic]], and the Northwest Atlantic as the regions in the direst need of preservation endeavors.  In 1963, the Marine Turtle Group was created by the chairman of the Survival Service Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources as the first international forum for sea turtle research and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Frederick. "Saving sea turtles: the evolution of the IUCN Marine Turtle Group." ''Endeavour'' 29.3 (2005): 114-118. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1973, the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] was passed, providing protection for all sea turtle species, and in 1977, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the [[NOAA|NOAA Fisheries]] and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to enforce the ESA with regards to sea turtles.  USFWS is responsible for all sea turtle conservation on nesting beaches and NOAA Fisheries are responsible for the marine conservation of sea turtles. The conservation of sea turtles on an international scale has been led by two major environmental agreements: the [[Indian Ocean]] – South-East Asian Marine Turtle Memorandum of Understanding and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles.&lt;ref name="nmfs.noaa"&gt;"Marine Turtles." Office of Protected Resources. NOAA Fisheries, 11 Nov 2010. Web. 8 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/turtles/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an attempt to lessen the number of turtles killed by fishing incidents, several new types of turtle-safe fishing equipment have been introduced such as the [[circle hook]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Read, Andrew. "Do circle hooks reduce the mortality of sea turtles in pelagic longlines? A review of recent experiments." ''Biological Conservation'' 135.2 (2007): 155-169. Web. 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fish bait]], and [[turtle excluder device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Bycatch - So what's the answer?." WWF Global. N.p., 2009. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.smartgear.org/smartgear_bycatch/bycatch_{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Poaching]] has been outlawed in most countries and turtle conservation education has been growing in both in size and efficiency.

Rehabilitation centers have been established as well, such as the Marine Life Center in [[Juno Beach, Florida]] &lt;ref&gt;"Our Mission." ''Loggerhead Marinelife Center''. N.p., 2010. Web. 9 Dec 2010. &lt;http://www.marinelife.org/mission&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center located on [[Topsail Island, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center Mission Statement." ''Topsail Turtle Project''. N.p., 2011. Web. 4 Oct 2011. &lt;http://seaturtlehospital.org/whoweare.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these centers is to help protect the local and [[endangered sea turtles|endangered sea turtle]] population by: a) rescuing sick or injured turtles and taking them to the treatment facility, b) rehabilitating these turtles through various types of treatment and/or surgery, and c) releasing turtles back into the ocean once they have been successfully nursed back to health. Although some sea turtles’ injuries are so severe that they can never become healed to the extent of being able to survive on their own outside of the facilities, hundreds of the patients from both the Gordon and Patricia Gray Veterinary Hospital in Juno Beach and the Sea Turtle Hospital in Topsail Island have been successfully rehabilitated and released in the last couple of decades.

Evaluating the progress of conservation programs is difficult, because many sea turtle populations have not been assessed adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bjorndal |first1= Karen |last2= Bowen |first2= Brian |year= 2011 |title= Better Science Needed for Restoration in the Gulf of Mexico |journal= Science |volume= 331 |pages= 537–538 |doi= 10.1126/science.1199935 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6017/537.full.pdf |accessdate= July 25, 2011 |issue=6017 |pmid=21292956 |last3= Chaloupka |first3= M. |last4= Crowder |first4= L.
