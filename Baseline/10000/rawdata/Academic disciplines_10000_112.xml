The '''Arcetri Observatory''' ({{lang-it|Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri}}) is an astrophysical observatory located in the hilly area of [[Arcetri]] on the outskirts of [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. It is located close to [[Villa Il Gioiello]], the residence of [[Galileo Galilei]] from 1631 to 1642. Observatory staff carry out theoretical and observational astronomy as well as designing and constructing astronomical instrumentation. The observatory has been heavily involved with the following instrumentation projects:

* The [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] 6.5 m telescope
* The [[Large Binocular Telescope|LBT]] 2x 8.4 m telescopes
* The [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] 3.5 m telescope
* The [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] telescope adaptive secondary mirror
* The 1.5 m [[Gornergrat Infrared Telescope]] (TIRGO)

The '''Areni-1 shoe''' is a 5,500-year-old [[leather]] shoe that was found in 2008 in excellent condition in the [[Areni-1 cave]] located in the [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/09/worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-found-in-armenia-2/ |title=World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved |last=Dindar |first=Shereen |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe, the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers.&lt;!-- the range of accuracy in dating methods may have quite a large variable, depending upon what is stated for this dating, it could make little difference that a few hundred years difference is claimed and make the find merely contemporary with that found in Germany --&gt; The discovery was made by an international team led by  [[Boris Gasparyan]], an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]] (co-directors of the project are [[Ron Pinhasi]] from [[University College Cork]] in [[Ireland]], and [[Gregory Areshian]] from [[UCLA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient shoe steps out of cave and into limelight |author=Bruce Bower |newspaper=Science News |date=July 3, 2010 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60099/title/Ancient_shoe_steps_out_of_cave_and_into_limelight |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
An Armenian post-graduate student, [[Diana Zardaryan]], discovered the leather shoe in the course of excavations by a team of archeologists from Armenia’s [[Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography]], Ireland and the United States.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-June12-2010"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2069047.html ''Oldest Leather Shoe A ‘Dream’ Find For Armenian Scientist''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), June 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The shoe was found upside down at the base of a shallow, rounded, and plastered pit that was {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|44|–|48|cm|abbr=on}} wide, beneath an overturned broken [[Chalcolithic]] ceramic bowl.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010984 |title=First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands |work=PLOS One |first1=Ron |last1=Pinhasi |first2=Boris |last2=Gasparian |first3=Gregory |last3=Areshian |first4=Diana |last4=Zardaryan |first5=Alexia |last5=Smith |first6=Guy |last6=Bar-Oz |first7=Thomas |last7=Higham |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broken pot and goat horns also were found nearby. Excavations in the same area also found [[Areni-1 winery|the world's oldest wine-making site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12158341 |title='Oldest known wine-making facility' found in Armenia. |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |work=BBC |date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was funded by the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Chitjian Foundation]], the [[Gfoeller Foundation]], the [[Steinmetz Family Foundation]], the [[Boochever Foundation]] and the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/10/oldest-leather-shoe-steps_n_607264.html |title=Oldest Leather Shoe Steps Out After 5,500 Years |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's findings were published on June 9, 2010, in the journal ''[[PLOS One]]''.

==Analysis==
The shoe was found in near-perfect condition due to the cool and dry conditions in the cave and a thick layer of sheep dung which acted as a solid seal. Large storage containers were found in the same cave, many of which held well-preserved wheat, barley, and [[apricot]]s, as well as other edible plants.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The shoe contained grass and the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was because the grass was used as insulation to keep the foot warm, or used to preserve the shape of the shoe while not being worn. Lead archaeologist Ron Pinhasi could not determine whether the shoe belonged to a man or a woman. While small, approximately a woman's U.S. and Canada size 7, European size 37, or UK size 6, he stated that "the shoe could well have fitted a man from that era".&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The [[shoe laces]] were preserved as well.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

Major similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of one-piece leather-hide shoes discovered across Europe and the one reported from Areni-1 Cave, suggesting that shoes of this type were worn for millennia across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"/&gt; According to Pinhasi, the Areni-1 shoe is similar to the Irish ''[[pampooties]]'', a shoe style worn in the [[Aran Islands]] up to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8KRXbqACR1CdoIW6YN9-GE4GjxQ | title = 5,500-year leather mocassin world's oldest shoe |agency=AFP | date = June 10, 2010 | accessdate = June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes are very similar to the traditional shoes of the Balkans, still seen today in festivals, known as [[Opanci]] (''Opanke'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100609-worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-armenia-science/ National Geographic: ''World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in [[Oxford]] and California, it was established that the shoe dates back to 3,500&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;!-- the variable should be given as =/- xxx years --&gt;  This date is a few hundred years older than the date given for the leather shoe found on [[Ötzi the Iceman]], 400 years older than those found at [[Stonehenge]], and 1,000 years older than those found at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/09/oldest-leather-shoe-archaeology/ |title=What's Older Than the Pyramids and Smells Worse Than a Mummy? |publisher=Fox News |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been treated for preservation, the Areni-1 shoe is on display at the [[History Museum of Armenia]], Yerevan.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://armenianow.com/arts_and_culture/23683/ancient_shoe_found_armenia/ |title=Do You Have that in a Size 38?: World’s oldest shoe to go on display in Yerevan |last=Gevorgyan |first=Siranuysh |work=ArmeniaNow.com |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campus Bible Study''' (or '''CBS''') was established in 1975 at the [[University of New South Wales]] by the then [[Anglican]] chaplain [[Phillip Jensen]]. CBS celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 2015, and continues to officially operate out of UNSW's Anglican Chaplaincy (similarly, there are chaplaincy groups for Muslims, Buddhists, etc.). The current Anglican Chaplain is Carl Matthei. 

=== Overview ===
During a typical week, CBS runs large public Bible-teaching meetings, many small-group Bible studies, and other training sessions in theology and ministry for students. CBS also runs three conferences per year, the largest one being Mid-Year Conference (MYC), which typically attracts 500-750 students. While officially linked to the movement of [[Sydney Anglicans]], Campus Bible Study is [[non-denominational]] and welcomes everyone to their public meetings. CBS focuses on the [[Bible]] rather than particular denominations beliefs, and seeks to challenge individuals to consider the [[gospel]] of [[Jesus]]. 

Throughout its history, CBS has been the source of a number of innovative ministries, including the development of the [[Ministry Training Strategy]] (MTS) and the creation of [[Matthias Media]]. Campus Bible Study has also been influential in encouraging an increasing number of young people from [[Sydney]] into full-time Christian Ministry, and has been linked to the growth in enrolments at [[Moore Theological College]] through MTS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

=== University Churches ===
CBS also runs five different university churches for various groups of students living in the residential colleges at UNSW. [http://www.unichurch.org.au/ Unichurch UNSW] is an English speaking congregation. The [http://www.focus-unsw.org/ Fellowship of Overseas University Students] (FOCUS) at UNSW runs four congregations for international students — Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, and International. 

=== Affiliations ===
CBS should not be confused with the Christian Union (CU), which (as of 2006) was a student-run, Student-Guild-affiliated organisation. CBS and the CU work in concert to conduct ministry on campus. Most members of CU are also members of CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcunsw.orgsync.com/org/christianunion/About|title=Christian Union UNSW|website=arcunsw.orgsync.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS is also affiliated with the [[Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afes.org.au/campus/campus-bible-study-university-new-south-wales-kensington|title=Campus Bible Study &gt; University of New South Wales, Kensington {{!}} Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (AFES)|website=afes.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (AFES) but is not a member — the AFES group at UNSW is the Christian Union (CU).

'''Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB)''' is a highly distinguished biological research institute in [[Asia]], located on the West Bank of the picturesque Canal Road [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It is an autonomous organization that is under administrative control of [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.

==History==
On 1 November 1981, University of the Punjab announced the "birth" of the Centre.  In April, 1983 the Federal Government allocated a sum of 1.635 million rupees to create a nucleus laboratory of the Centre.  In November, 1985 the proposal to establish the Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) was approved at a cost of 24.55 million rupees.  In 1986, the CAMB project was upgraded into a Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB) and the cost of setting it up was subsequently revised in January 1991, to 44.33 million rupees.  In April 1987, the Federal Ministry of Science &amp; Technology (MOST) approved the establishment of a Centre for Applied Molecular Biology (CAMB), located back to back with the laboratory block of the Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB).
The CEMB established nucleus laboratories in March, 1985 in two student laboratories of the Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore.  Construction work on the CEMB building started in 1987 on a site located in Lahore's southern suburb of Thokar Niaz Baig along the Canal.  The scientific staff moved into the new building in late 1992-93.

==Admission process==

The Centre offers [[Master of Science|M.Phil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Molecular Biology]]. Annually, only 20-30 position for academically brilliant students with research aptitude, from all over the world, are available for M.Phil and Ph.D. The admission process is one of the toughest and highly competitive in [[Pakistan]] with admission rate of around 10% annually. A greater number of foreign scholars are also pursuing their M.Phil and Ph.D in the centre.

==Research groups==

CEMB has the following research groups:

#Applied and Functional Genomics
#Bioinformatics
#Congenital Mental Retardation
#Crop Breeding and GMO Detection Group
#Development of Recombinant Biopharmaceuticals
#Forensic Research Lab
#Forensic Services Lab
#Hearing Impairment
#Medical Genetics Group
#Molecular Medicine
#Molecular Virology and Molecular diagnostics
#Plant Biosafety,
#Plant Genomics,
#Plant Transformation
#Seed Biotechnology

==Achievements==
CEMB researchers have made a great contribution to Molecular Biology. Recently, CEMB has made Bt transgenic rice, Bt transgenic cotton and virus-free gladiolus, potato and tomato. Several kits are made for the PCR-based diagnosis of HCV and HBV . A total of 11 new deafness loci, 3 vision impairment loci and 17 new genes are discovered here. All these results have been published in the form of research papers in more than 100 international journals of high reputation including Nature, American Journal of Human Genetics, European Journal of Human Genetics, Molecular Vision, Virology Journal, Infectious Diseases, PLoS, Differentiation, Forensic Science International and International Journal of Legal Medicine. Besides, CEMB holds the rights to 7 patents for inventions made by its scientists. In recognition of these achievements, Islamic Development Bank conferred it with Science and Technology Prize in 2008.

==International collaborations==
As research in general and molecular biology in particular is an expensive business to do, CEMB often has collaborations with many national and international research institutes. These include National Institute of Health (NIH) USA, University of Cincinnati, University of Washington, University of Arizona, Johns-Hopkins University, Brigham Young University and US Department of Agriculture.

==Local collaborations==
CEMB also has linkages with local institutes like Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, University of Lahore, Lahore College for Women University, Forman Christian University Lahore, Comsats Islamabad, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Government College University Lahore, Government College University Faisalabad, Baluchistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, University of Health Sciences Lahore, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, King Edwards Medical University Lahore and Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore.

==CEMB and CAMB==

CEMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and CAMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). Although, both are independent and autonomous, CEMB is the academic and basic research wing while CAMB is the applied and commercial production wing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18596">'''Child integration''' is the inclusion of [[children]] in a variety of mature daily activities of families and communities. This contrasts with, for example, [[age segregation]]; separating children into age-defined activities and institutions (e.g., some models of organized schooling). Integrating children in the range of mature family and community activities gives equal value and responsibility to children as contributors and collaborators, and can be a way to help them learn. Children's integration provides a learning environment because children are able to observe and pitch in as they feel they can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|title=Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|volume=37|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, child integration into "[[adult]]" life is not as common as it used to be. However, in other cultures social norms continue to incorporate children into the mature, productive activities of the family and community. In all cultures child integration is present in one way or another. For example,  nearly all children's first language learning seems to be supported through integration with a mature linguistic community. Children usually are not taught in a classroom how to speak, but instead [[Observational learning|learn by observing]] the language and pitching it when they can.

== Examples of children in collaborative communities ==

Children in Indigenous communities participate in mature activities with the guidance from someone who has practice in that activity. When engaged in shared endeavors the guider and the learner both notice and assess how much understanding the learner has in the task and the guider provides support if it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Arauz|first3=Rebeca|last4=Correa-Chavez|first4=Maricela|last5=Angelillo|first5=Cathy|title=Firsthand learning through intent participation|journal=Analise Psicologia|date=2004|volume=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous cultures emphasize and instill values of being respectful, empathic and cooperative to their children. These values are practiced through tasks like [[co-sleeping]] and group play which helps bring about close connections within the family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maschinot|first1=Beth|title=The changing face of the United States: The influence of culture on early child development.|date=2008|publisher=Zero to Three}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different ways children can be integrated into society. One example, child care educators in certain Native communities, like the [[First Nations]] in Canada have taught children traditional language, where then the children have the responsibility to spread that language knowledge by teaching their parents and other family members, thus ingratiating them into society with responsibility to carry on the language legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Jessica|last2=Simpkins|first2=Maureen|year=2004|title=The community within the Child: Integration of Indigenous Knowledge into First Nations Childcare Process and Practice|journal=The American Indian Quarterly|volume=28|page=480|doi=10.1353/aiq.2004.0091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chippewa]] people have several different methods of teaching, such as lecturing and counseling, and integrating children into adult and community life. Overall, the children do the same tasks as their mothers and fathers just on a smaller scale. For example, a young girl might learn to make nets like her mother and uses the same knots her mother uses but makes smaller nets than her mother. Throughout the years she will slowly make bigger and bigger nets and perfect the skill that her mother and her mother's mother before her had. These skills may be learned by observation and sometimes if a specific person in the community is very skillful at something, the adults might recommend the child go find that person and learn from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilger|first1=Sister, M.I.|title=Chippewa child life and its cultural background|journal=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology|date=1951|issue=Bulletin 146|pages=55–60, 114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community endeavors ===
The integration of children into community and family endeavors in Indigenous American Communities begins as early as infancy. Among the [[Mayan peoples]] of the Yucatan peninsula, children are allowed to roam freely  allowing them ample opportunity to become acquainted with the mundane activities of the family. In the Mexican indigenous community of the Mazahua, children will coordinate their activities with those of their parents in a manner that allows them to cooperate in familial endeavors and may at times be granted a leading position in the endeavor. Children are considered to be valuable and responsible contributors of the community. The process of child integration into mature activities begins in infancy and continuous throughout time; between ages 3 and 4 the child will already be participating in some of the family's day to day activities, by ages 5 and 7 that child will already be cooperating in most of the endeavors that adults engage in and will have also earned several important responsibilities which can range from performing certain household tasks to providing childcare for younger siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Mejia Arauz|first3=Rebeca|last4=Correa-Chavez|first4=Maricela|last5=Angelillo|first5=Cathy|title=First Hand Learning Through Intent Participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2003|volume=54|issue=1|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118|pmid=12499516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural practice of integrating children in the mature activities of the family and community is common in many [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]]. Many integrate children into "adult" activities, work life, and other cultural practices at a very young age. Among the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] people of the Andes, families accept the child as a part of an integral process towards a collective wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-year-olds in the Chillihuani community frequently get their own food and drink, and those of herding families participate in herding and caring for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In this community, work and play are not two separable things (i.e., one for adult and one for children). The children enjoy having real responsibilities and find pride in being able to contribute to their society.

Similarly, some [[Chippewa]] communities of Washington also commonly integrate children in the mature activities of the community. Children are expected to observe and work with their parent to be able to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|develop skills]] for that line of work. Young girls assist their mothers with beadwork, household chores, chopping wood, etc., and boys are expected to work on canoe-making with the men and are given arrows to learn hunting skills at 5 or 6 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Hilger, M. I. (1951). Chippewa child life and its cultural background. Washington: U.S. G.P.O.)p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily household activities provide the child the ability to learn cultural practices such as different food dishes, hygiene, and parenting skills, as well as the social values and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, Viviana. 2005. Pricing the Priceless Child: The Changing Social Value of Children. New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaskins, Suzanne &amp; Ruth Paradise. 2010. Learning through Observation in Daily Life. In: David Lancy, John Bock &amp; Suzanne Gaskins (eds.), The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood. Lanham: Altamira Press, pp109.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for children in Indigenous American communities to learn through trial and error instead of explicit instruction. This is due to the cultural understanding of "echando a perder se enesena la gente" (throwing to lose, teaches people) which promotes optimism and growth of the child in the community, allowing the youth to feel comfortable making mistakes as long as they keep working towards their goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urrieta | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Familia and Comunidad-Based Saberes: Learning in an Indigenous Heritage Community | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 320–335 | doi = 10.1111/aeq.12028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the town of [[Tepoztlan]] are encouraged to participate in community activities. The people there believe that everyone can contribute something to community endeavors. Young children are encouraged to participate by being brought to various meetings and activities by their mothers, so as they grow older, they request to be admitted into the group on their own will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Percy-Smith|first1=Barry|last2=Thomas|first2=Nigel|title=A handbook of children and young people's  participation: Perspectives from theory and practice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-87107-3|pages=141–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political movements and civic life ===
Some Indigenous American communities can incorporate young children into the political activities of the community. Political violence and displacement within the community of San Agustin Loxicha, [[Oaxaca]] created an important aspect of child participation in the community's struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Anne-Marie | year = 2007 | title = The Children of Loxicha, Mexico: Exploring Ideas of Childhood and the Rules of Participation | url = | journal = Children, Youth and Environments | volume = 17 | issue = 2| page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this community, it is common for young children to take part in marches or sit-ins, hunger strikes, school life, child play, and accept the political part of their lives instead of seeing it as a hardship or something to be pitied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Anne-Marie | year = 2007 | title = The Children of Loxicha, Mexico: Exploring Ideas of Childhood and the Rules of Participation | url = | journal = Children, Youth and Environments | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 43–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Nahua indigenous town of Tepoztlan located near Mexico City, children, adolescents, and older members of the community were involved in a 5-year long political movement against the construction of a golf course in their town. During assemblies children participated by aiding in the preparation of food and drinks for the crowd, while adolescents brought in groups of peers to further political involvement in the community. During marches and protest children and adolescents were active members of the civic movement. Any repression that the group suffered on behalf of the authorities was not seen as something negative in the experience of the youth, but was instead something that would further motivate their desire to be politically active. Through their integration into the political structure of the civil movement, the child's/adolescent's understanding of the issue expanded to such a degree that they would not only have physical presence in the group but would also be capable of offering new perspectives and potential solutions to the issue at hand. It is important to note that none of the children and adolescents involved were forced to do so. If a child showed an interest in the political movement they were encouraged by the adults to become participants but ultimately the choice was always left to them. Once a child decided to become involved the parents and other adults respected the pace and rhythm of that involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corona Caraveo|first1=Yolanda|title=Todos Como Uno: la participación infantil en comunidades de tradicion indigena|journal=III Conferencia de la Red Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Childwatch International|date=2006|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language brokering ===
In some immigrant communities, children link their family and friends to the environment around them by translating and paraphrasing words, phrases or occurring situations.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana, Marjorie, F. &amp; Reynolds, Jennifer &amp; Meza Marie (January/February/March 2003) "In other words: Translating or para-phrasing as a family literacy practice in immigrant households", Reading Research Quarterly 38, 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is known as [[Generation Gap|language brokering]] and is used by children in immigrant communities to integrate themselves into family endeavors and into [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Elaine (2010) "Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it, ISSN 1974-4382&lt;/ref&gt; The child's contribution by language brokering integrates them into many environments, such as the doctor's office, at parent-teachers' conferences, banks, housing offices, and various sorts of negotiation activities. Subsequently, children who engage in language brokering are more likely to also be representatives of their community when transitioning into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Elaine (2010) "Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it, ISSN 1974-4382&lt;/ref&gt; Child integration has become very important to form linkages between new immigrant communities and the predominant culture and new forms of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic systems]].

With the increased interaction in larger societies children in Indigenous Mayan communities who are bilingual help monolingual parents as interpreters. For example, the children will translate for parents when selling products in the barrios of Cancun, where the primary language is Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskins|first1=Suzanne|title=From corn to cash: Change and continuity within Mayan families|journal=Ethos|date=2003|volume=31|issue=2|page=248|doi=10.1525/eth.2003.31.2.248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productive endeavors ===
In some indigenous communities, children are often integrated as active participants into family and community work.  [[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]] is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=
Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|year=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some families, young children contribute to the family's finances by taking a job in a factory or a store under the supervision of a formal adult figure, while some join the family business under the oversight of their parents and older siblings. When children join the family business they tend to gain knowledge of a trade such as accounting, public relations and how to be able to time manage. Some children not only obtain an economic boost for the family as a whole, but also learn autonomy and [[Prosocial behavior|altruism]] with regards to having their own earned income to support the family and also to spend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar, M. (1991). Young workers in Latin America: protection or self-determination?. Child Welfare, 70269-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's motivation as integrated contributors ==
Children in Indigenous American communities pitch in to community endeavors because they experience their contribution having a tangible effect on their community. The children often contribute without being told and children get to learn how to do the activity as they contribute. However, children aren't just born with this way of learning by observation; they have been given the opportunity by being encouraged to attend, observing, and participating in mature activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppens |title=Benefits and processes of expanding repertoires|journal=Human Development|date=June 2014|volume=57|issue=2–3|pages=150–161|doi=10.1159/000356770|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In indigenous communities, children's and adult's interests in participation must be viewed as equal, not just the adults forcing their views onto the children. Children are seen as a part of community just as much as adults. In many cultures, children are expected to take on tasks that are important to community. Children are also seen as integral members of the community, rather than separate from adults. Some cultures even give children control over specific goods, such as livestock or [[arable land]] and the expectations that come with this may also be seen as forms of participation. These ideas of children actively participating in their communities and influencing the society opens up opportunities for the participation of children &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Percy-Smith|first1=Barry|last2=Thomas|first2=Nigel|title=A handbook of children and young people's  participation: Perspectives from theory and practice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-87107-3|pages=141–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of age segregation in the West ==
Segregating children by age was not always the norm in the United States. A century and a half ago, children in the US had access to a wide range of adult activities and were integrated into multiple aspects of family functioning and survival. The change from this integration into segregation was a product of [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]], Western formal schooling, [[child labor]] laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as Psychology and Education. A combination of the above caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and services such as childcare emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Glida | first2 = M. | last3 = Chavajay | first3 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Children's Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 431–440 | doi=10.1177/1745691610375558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9037">'''Conductive Education''', or CE, is an educational system, based on the work of Hungarian Professor [[András Pető]], that has been specifically developed for children and adults who have [[motor disorder]]s of neurological origin such as [[cerebral palsy]].

CE is based on the premise that a person who has a motor disorder may not only have a medical condition requiring treatment, but may often also have a major problem in learning that requires [[special education]]. Its spread has been largely due to the advocacy of families; and research studies of its efficacy have so far been inconclusive&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, A (1999) Towards Conductive Education. In {{ISBN|978-963-85499-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of conductive education ==
Conductive Education’s origin lies in the works of Hungarian Professor [[András Pető]] whose [[National Institute of Motor Therapy]] created a framework for an educational model in which children with disabilities could have an education that met their particular physical and intellectual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orvostortenet.hu/tankonyvek/tk-05/pdf/2.15/2007_200_201_forrai_judit_history_of.pdf "HISTORY OF A SPECIAL HEALING METHOD..."], Judit Forrai, MD, PhD, Lecturer Semmelweis University&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductive education entered the wider public consciousness in the mid-1980s, as a result of two television documentaries — "Standing Up For Joe" (1986), and "To Hungary with Love" (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/reluctantinternationalists/blog/hungary-love/ "To Hungary with Love"], The Reluctant Internationalists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-price-of-a-miracle-the-peto-method-of-treating-handicapped-children-was-hailed-as-a-breakthrough-2323277.html "The price of a miracle"], October 2011, The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/24/guardianobituaries.schools "Maria Hari"], 2001 obituary at The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
The goals of conductive education include assisting children in developing maximized orthofunction (the ability to conduct [[activities of daily living]], such as dressing, eating, and self-care). The program also seeks to develop maximal independence in school, the community at large, and the workforce using minimal or no [[adaptive equipment]]. This program especially targets children under age six for maximal potential impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conductivelearningcenter.org/about/what-is-conductive-education/|title=Conductive Learning Center {{!}} Home|website=conductivelearningcenter.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==
=== The child is a unified whole ===

The detrimental effects of a brain injury impede the whole development of the child, therefore practitioners of conductive education prefer a treatment that considers the individual as a unified whole and provides an overall, holistic intervention. Holistic means that everything in life, the total functioning of the individual, personal development and social organization, is seen as interdependent, interconnected, multi- leveled, interacting and cohesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tatlow A |title=Towards a comprehensive motor education in the treatment of cerebral palsy |journal=Physiotherapy |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=332–6 |date=October 1980 |pmid=7465657 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of “whole” underpins the system from which Pető thought that children with motor disorders would benefit.

=== Targeting the whole personality ===

Allport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allport, Gordon W. |title=Pattern and Growth in Personality |publisher=Harcourt College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |year=1961 |pages= |isbn=0-03-010810-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that  “Personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psycho-physical systems that determine his characteristic and behavior and thought.” This definition implies that personality is not just a sum of traits, one added to another, but rather that the different traits are held together in a special relationship to the whole. ''Dynamic'' implies that the individual's personality is constantly evolving and changing. From time to time and from one situation to another, there are changes in the structural organization which are influenced by the concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hurlock, Elizabeth Bergner |title=Personality development |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1973 |pages= |isbn=0-07-031447-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductive education attempts to build up the impaired children’s personalities gradually in a manner appropriate to their age. In Pető’s system, the individual is not a recipient of treatment, s/he is an active participant in the learning process. CE is conceived of as a partnership between educator and learners to create circumstances for learning- it is an all day learning process &lt;ref&gt;Sutton, A. (1993) Ed.  Conductive movement therapy as special education. By Pető,A    
The Conductor. No.18, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activity and intention ===

Pető asserted that restoring the interrupted learning process is not possible without the active participation of the individual, and that consequently passive exercises or patterns cannot change or improve the functional stage of the individual.

=== Continuity and consistency ===

In conductive education, continuity is considered necessary to reinforce a new skill. An opportunity to use the same skill for many different tasks is also considered essential. The system has to provide possibilities for children to practice emerging skills not only in specific learning situations but in the many inter-connecting, in-between situations of which life consists. In order to achieve this, CE turns any given part of a child’s day into a learning situation.

=== An interdisciplinary model ===

Pető believed that, in order to provide a unified treatment, it is vital that the group of professionals who are responsible for the program have training based on the same philosophy and relevant practice. Instead of a multidisciplinary approach, Pető applied an interdisciplinary model where a single specially trained group of professionals are responsible for the planning and implementation of the whole process.

== Components ==

Pető’s system consists of many interrelated facets, and  an conductive educators believe that conductive education works only as a unified system, not as a composite or amalgamation.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, A. (1998). Conductive Education As Exemplar Of The Emerging Paradigm Of Dynamic Inclusion, With New Emphases For Educational Research. Paper Presented at the European Conference on Educational Research, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 17–20 September 1998 [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/000000887.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductive Education as a system has seven significant elements: Group, Facilitation, Daily Routine, Rhythmic Intention, Conductive Furniture, Task Series, and the Conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conductive-education.org.nz/elements.htm "Elements"], The New Zealand Foundation for Conductive Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/treatment/therapy/conductive-education/ "What is conductive education?"] cerebralpalsy.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Both a 2000 Swedish report,&lt;ref name="SBU"&gt;Forssberg, Hans and Birgit Rösblad, ''Conductive education -an educational program for children with cerebral palsy'', Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, 2000 [http://www.sbu.se/en/Published/Alert/Conductive-education-an-educational-program-for-children-with-cerebral-palsy/?epslanguage=EN]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 review&lt;ref name="Darrah"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0020332/ |title=Darrah J, Watkins B, Chen L, Bonin C. Effects of conductive education intervention for children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy: an AACPDM evidence report. Rosemont, IL, USA: American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM), (AACPDM Evidence Report), 2003: 34. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the research literature did not provide conclusive evidence either in support of or against conductive education, and that the limited number of studies and their poor quality made purely evidence-based decision-making about conductive education impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">A '''copywriting agency''' is a business that provides writing and editing services to businesses and other organizations. Like individual copywriters, [[copywriting]] agencies may offer writing on a for-hire or per-project basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://job-descriptions.careerplanner.com/Copy-Writers.cfm|title=Job Duties and Tasks for: "Copy Writer"|publisher=CareerPlanner.com|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, because copywriting agencies often offer the services of many staff members, they may offer a broader range of services than can individuals. These services include but not limited to writing, editing, content or marketing consulting, [[brand]]ing, [[Product naming|naming]], [[scriptwriting]], [[speechwriting]], [[information architecture]], print and [[web design]] and layout, [[Software engineering|software development]], [[social network]]ing consulting and implementation, and [[project management]]. An agency may also partner with other businesses—for example, design or advertising firms—or with in-house client teams. Depending on the project, agency staff may work onsite with the client, from the agency offices, or virtually from any location.

Copywriting agencies may be designed on an employee model, with full- or part-time employees providing services to clients. Others may work with a regular team of trusted contractors, while still others function more like middlemen, connecting clients and editorial freelancers and taking a cut of the proceeds from each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careercenter.aaaa.org/jobs/5402501/copywriter|title=Copywriter|publisher=AAAA Career Center|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business and nonprofit clients often hire copywriting agencies for larger projects that fall outside of existing skills and time or staffing needs, or for projects that require expertise in a specific discipline or area of knowledge. Many agencies specialize in one or more industries—doing work for clients, for example, in publishing, finance, technology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, the environment, engineering, government, the military, education, the arts, or the nonprofit world. Others employ writers, editors, etc. with varying specialties, so as to work for a variety of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-15/how-to-hire-an-ad-agencybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=How to Hire an Ad Agency|last=McKee|first=Steve|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing for overall economic trends, job prospects for both individual copywriters and copywriting agencies expanded during the 1990s and 2000s, for reasons including an increased need for production and editing of online contentand an increase in business outsourcing and freelancing. As of 2012, employment for freelance writers is expected to continue to grow.

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

The word  was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the hypertext) to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the ''hypotext''), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly.  The hypertext may of course become original text in its own right.&lt;ref name="Allen2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Graham|title=The New Critical Idiom|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Ch 3: Hypertextuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has more recently been used in extended ways, for example, Adamczewski suggests that the [[Iliad]] was used as a ''structuring hypotext'' in [[Mark's Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Adamczewski2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamczewski|first=Bartosz |title=Q Or Not Q?: The So-Called Triple, Double, and Single Traditions in the Synoptic Gospels|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35582">[[File:Teatersport -4.jpg|thumb|Swedish actors performing in [[theatresports]], a competitive form of improv]]
'''Improvisational theatre''', often called '''provisation ''' or '''improv''', is the form of [[theatre]], often [[comedy]], in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].

Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.

Improvisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]]. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=Béatrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers’ Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

==History==
The earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed. Alison Hodge. New York: Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Nobel-winner [[Dario Fo]] received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style]]
Modern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the [[progressive education]] movement initiated by [[John Dewey]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/tspwb1hist.html|title=TheatreSports History|work=interactiveimprov.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people credit American [[Dudley Riggs]] as the first [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',&lt;ref name="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

Spolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.&lt;ref name=Wonderful&gt;The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book "Something Wonderful Right Away" (Limelight Editions, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;Janet Coleman's "The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the current "rules" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her protégé, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.&lt;ref name=Wonderful /&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt;

Many of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].

Simultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.

In 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.

In San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.

Modern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s "happenings" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s "Forum Theatre" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.

[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.

In 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre &amp; Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called [[netprov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichtung-digital.de/en/journal/aktuelle-nummer/?postID=577|title=Current Issue - Dichtung Digital|work=dichtung-digital.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form relies on [[social media]] to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.

==Improvisational comedy==
[[File:Improvisers in Chicago.jpeg|thumb|Three improvisers performing longform improv comedy at the Gorilla Tango Theatre in Chicago.]]
Modern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.

Shortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined [[Theater game|game]], structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; The shortform improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.

Longform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]]; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Detroit]], [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; and is building a growing following in [[Denver]], [[Montreal]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[New Orleans]], [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hawaii]]. Outside the [[United States]], longform improv has a growing presence in the [[United Kingdom]], especially in cities such as [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==
Other forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde&lt;ref&gt;Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans&lt;/ref&gt; in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.

[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as "sound and movement" and "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s "[[poor theater]]" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason="[1]"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.

Longform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.

==Applying improv principles in life==
Many people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what's going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say "yes." And if you're lucky, you'll find people who will say "yes" back.}}

[[Tina Fey]] in her book ''[[Bossypants]]'' lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109232959/http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-09 |title=Tina Fey's Rules For Improv… And Your Career |work=Women 2.0 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html "Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, "executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves."

==In film and television==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Many directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.

Some of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Rob Reiner]].

Improv comedy techniques have also been used in television and [[Stand-up comedian|stand-up comedy]] in hit shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Thick of It]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; also had some improvised elements in them.

==Psychology==
In the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569780120070722#preview |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.

In the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, and"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and process==
Improvisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.

In order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as ''gagging''—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, And..."]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''"Yes, And..."'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a "base (or shared) reality" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or "miraculously" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.

Because improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.

==Community==
Many theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.

In addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.

In Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.

==Notable Contributors To The Field==
Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer–author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of "Commun-edy Outreach" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.

[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true "people's Theatre", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of "That Movie In Your Head", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name "ImprovOlympic" and now as "IO"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's "Time Dash" game with Del Close's "Harold" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.

[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the "second generation" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the "Clap-In" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.

In the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.

Gunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativität des Improvisationstheaters''. Gunter Lösel. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial engineering''' is an inter-disciplinary profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex [[process (engineering)|processes]], [[system]]s, or [[organizations]] by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Salvendy, Gabriel. Handbook of Industrial Engineering. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc; 3rd edition p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;.     

Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in business administration, management, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems or processes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  From these results, they are able to create new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of man, materials and machines and improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iienet2.org/details.aspx?id=716|title=What IEs Do|website=www.iienet2.org|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Depending on the sub-specialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, [[operations research]], [[systems engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[production engineering]], [[management science]], [[management engineering]], [[financial engineering]], [[ergonomics]] or [[human factors engineering]], [[safety engineering]], or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.   

Even though its underlying concepts overlap considerably with certain business-oriented disciplines, such as [[operations management]], Industrial engineering is a longstanding engineering discipline subject to (and eligible for) [[professional engineering]] licensure in most jurisdictions.   

== History ==
{{See also|List of industrial engineers}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

=== Origins ===
==== Industrial Revolution ====
There is a general consensus among historians that the roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4-1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specialization of labor ====
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]
Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

==== Interchangeable parts ====
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

=== Pioneers ===
[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856 – 1915) is generally credited as being the father of the Industrial Engineering discipline.  He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Steven's University and earned several patents from his inventions.  His books, ''Shop Management'' and ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]'' which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of Industrial Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingenieroindustrialpro.com/ All about industrial engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;  Improvements in work efficiency under his methods was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and reduction in time required to carry out the work.  With an abiding faith in the scientific method, Taylor's contribution to "Time Study" sought a high level of precision and predictability for manual tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

The husband-and-wife team of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] (1868 – 1924) and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] (1878 – 1972) was the other cornerstone of the Industrial Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering.  They categorized the elements of human motion into 18 basic elements called ''therbligs''.  This development permitted analysts to design jobs without knowledge of the time required to do a job. These developments were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or ergonomics.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

in 1908, the first course on Industrial Engineering was offered as an elective at [[Pennsylvania State University]], which became a separate program in 1909 through the efforts of [[Hugo Diemer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industryengineering08.blogspot.com/2012/04/industrial-engineering-definition.html|title=Industrial Engineering - Definition, Explanation, History, and Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by [[Cornell University]].

In 1912 [[Henry Laurence Gantt]] developed the [[Gantt chart]] which outlines actions the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form familiar to us today by [[Henry Wallace Clark|Wallace Clark]].

Assembly lines: moving car factory of [[Henry Ford]] (1913) accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare ("welfare capitalism") and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity.

Comprehensive quality management system ([[Total quality management]] or TQM) developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part of the recovery of Japan after the war.

The [[Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers|American Institute of Industrial Engineering]] was formed in 1948. The early work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] as interest grew from merely improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing process; most notably starting with the presentation by [[Henry R. Towne]] (1844 - 1924) of his paper ''The Engineer as An Economist'' (1186).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsof07amer#page/428/mode/2up Engineer as Economist]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern practice ===
In 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), you can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity.  These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility.   Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.

=== Compared to other engineering disciplines ===
Engineering is traditionally decompositional. To understand the whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts and puts them back together, becoming the master of the whole.
Industrial and systems engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be understood without the context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people understand the parts first, then they can understand the whole. In ISE, they understand the whole first, and then they can understand the role of each part.

Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that influence the entire situation&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=Robert|date=|title=The Nature of Industrial Engineering|url=|journal=The Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=5|pages=4|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while other engineering disciplines focuses on the design of inanimate objects 

"Industrial Engineers integrate combinations of people, information, materials, and equipment that produce innovative and efficient organizations. In addition to manufacturing, Industrial Engineers work and consult in every industry, including hospitals, communications, e-commerce, entertainment, government, finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sales, accounting, banking, travel, and transportation."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=imsefacpub|title=DETAILS AND DESCRIPTION OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING|last=Savory|first=Paul|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

" Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management. One of the main focuses of an Industrial Engineer is to improve the working environments of people – not to change the worker, but to change the workplace."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"All engineers, including Industrial Engineers, take mathematics through calculus and differential equations. Industrial Engineering is different in that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is based on continuous variable math. We emphasize the use of linear algebra and difference equations, as opposed to the use of differential equations which are so prevalent in other engineering disciplines. This emphasis becomes evident in optimization of production systems in which we are sequencing orders, scheduling batches, determining the number of materials handling units, arranging factory layouts, finding sequences of motions, etc. As, Industrial Engineers, we deal almost exclusively with systems of discrete components."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
== Etymology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

===Etymology===
While originally applied to [[manufacturing]], the use of "industrial" in "industrial engineering" can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. In fact, the "Industrial" in Industrial engineering means the "industry" in its broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darwish|first=H|last2=van Dyk|first2=L|date=2016|title=The industrial engineering identity: from historic skills to modern values, duties, and roles|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2224-78902016000300006|journal=South African Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=27|issue=3|pages=50-63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have changed the term "industrial" to broader terms such as Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research, Industrial Engineering &amp; Management. 
== Sub-disciplines ==
Industrial engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are industrial engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them such as Supply Chain and Logistics, and Facilities and Energy Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wonderfulengineering.com/what-is-industrial-engineering/|title=What is Industrial Engineering?|last=|first=|date=|website=Wonderful Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Systems_Engineering_and_Industrial_Engineering|title=Industrial Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]] (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), [[materials science]], [[computer science]], electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work - which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses | title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/ | title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG) | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses | title=Courses | publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/ | title=Courses | publisher=Northwestern University | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html | title=ISE Electives | publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

=== Differences in Teaching ===
While Industrial Engineering as a formal degree has been around for years, consensus on what topics should be taught and studied differs across countries. For example, Turkey focuses on a very technical degree while Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom have a management focus degree, thus making it less technical.  The United States focuses on case-studies and group problem solving&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bachelorsportal.com/articles/636/what-is-industrial-engineering-and-why-should-i-study-it.html|title=What is Industrial Engineering and Why Should I Study It?|last=Oanca|first=Alexandra|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Practicing Engineers ==
Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[computer programming|coding]] skills).

The '''Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta)''' is a teaching and research institute at the [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|Department of Architecture]] of [[ETH Zurich]], situated on the ETH Zurich’s Hönggerberg Campus site.

== History ==
The Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) was founded on 1 January 1967 as a research body at the Architecture Department of ETH Zurich. &lt;ref&gt;  For the history of the institute see Martin Fröhlich, “Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH-Zürich”, in Unsere Kunstdenkmaler, 24, no. 1 (1973), pp. 16–20; Katharina Medici-Mall, “Sammeln, forschen, ausstellen, publizieren: Das Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH Zürich”, Aktuelles Bauen, 18 (April 1983), pp. 23–6; Ruth Hanisch and Steven Spier, “ ‘History is not the Past but Another Mightier Presence’: The Founding of the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich and its Effects on Swiss Architecture”, The Journal of Architecture, 14, no. 6 (2009), pp. 655–86.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The opening symposium was held on 23 June 1967. &lt;ref&gt;Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur (ed.), Reden und Vortrag zur Eröffnung (Birkhäuser: Basle, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since its beginnings in 1967, the past and the present, theory and practice, have been the cornerstones and reference framework for the work undertaken at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta). Besides teaching activities in the fields of the history of art and architecture, [[architectural theory]] and [[urban design]], the institute’s core focus since its launch has lain in mediating and exploring architecture in its historical depth and thematic breadth. The results of the institute’s in-house research, which is primarily influenced by the areas of interest of the teaching staff and the holdings of the simultaneously established archive, have been presented since 1968 in a publication series. These first appeared in cooperation with the Birkhäuser publishing house (in the “rainbow series”), later with the Ammann publishing house and since the mid-1980s in the [[gta Verlag]], which today enjoys the reputation of being one of the leading architecture publishers.

The absorption of the so-called [[Gottfried Semper|Semper]] Archive from the ETH Bibliothek on the occasion of the creation of the institute forms the foundation of the [[gta Archives]], which over time has advanced to become an internationally renowned research facility. Since then, the main acquisition emphasis has been on the architecture of the nineteenth century and the pre-modern, modern (Swiss) architecture in the form of collections ([[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM)), as well as advance legacies and bequests of individual architects of international stature  (including [[Karl Moser]], [[Hans Bernoulli]], [[Lux Guyer]], [[Haefeli Moser Steiger]], [[Ernst Gisel]], [[Fritz Haller]] and [[Trix Haussmann|Trix]] and [[Robert Haussmann]]).

The organisational office for exhibitions by the ETH Zurich’s Department of Architecture became incorporated in the institute in 1974, and – since 1986 as gta Exhibitions – affords a wide public insight into contemporary architectural discourse and current research at the department.

=== Institute directors ===

* [[Adolf Max Vogt]] (1920–2013), director from 1967 to 1974 and 1981 to 1982
* [[Bernhard Hoesli]] (1923–1984), director from 1975 to 1980
* [[Heinz Ronner]] (1924–1992), director from 1983 to 1987
* [[Werner Oechslin]] (born 1944), director from 1987 to 1998 and 1999 to 2006
* [[Kurt W. Forster]] (born 1935), director from 1998 to 1999
* [[Andreas Tönnesmann]] (1953–2014), director from 2006 to 2010
* [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] (born 1951), director from 2010 to 2016
* [[Laurent Stalder]] (born 1970), director since 2016

===Professorial chairs and divisions ===
Today the institute encompasses the following professorial chairs:
*  Chair of the History and Theory of Architecture, Maarten Delbeke 
*  Adjunct Professor of the History of Architecture of Modernity, Ita Heinze-Greenberg  
*  Chair of Theory of Architecture, Laurent Stalder 
*  Chair of the History of Art and Architecture, Philip Ursprung 
*  Chair of the History of Urban Design (vacant) 

The following divisions assist the research projects and convey their findings:
*  gta Archives 
*  gta Verlag
*  gta Exhibitions 

The gta Institute assists in the promotion of academic newcomers with its own doctoral programme (since 2012). The institute’s educational provisions are supplemented by the programme Master of Studies in the History and Theory of Architecture, which mediates between practice and scholarship (since 1992).
There is a close academic exchange with the Werner Oechslin Library Foundation, associated with the ETH Zurich via a cooperation agreement.

== Teaching and research areas ==

The institute’s task is to empirically appraise and theoretically reflect upon architecture in its historical depth and ideological breadth. Along with the establishing and verification of facts, the gta Institute has always been at pains to review applied methods in terms of their validity as models and to make them beneficial to contemporary architecture. As an institute, the gta researches and teaches the history of knowledge of architecture, building forms and techniques, the function of architecture and its relations to society and politics, the evolution of design and architectural thinking from the beginnings to today, as well as the methodologies of architectural history work ranging from building analysis through to the digital humanities.

[[File:UNESCO-ICH-blue.svg|150px|thumb|Logo of Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]
An '''intangible cultural heritage''' ('''ICH''') is a practice, representation, expression, knowledge, or skill, as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts, and cultural spaces that are considered by [[UNESCO]] to be part of a place's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; 
Intangible cultural heritage is considered by Member States of [[UNESCO]] in relation to the tangible [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] focusing on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] made a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;meeting_id=00057#meet_00057
|title=Meeting of 2001
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=home
|title=Official website
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.

==Definition==

The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/convention|title = UNESCO|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines 
the intangible cultural heritage as the practices, representations, expressions, as well as the knowledge and skills (including instruments, objects, artifacts, cultural spaces), that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. It is sometimes called living cultural heritage, and is manifested inter alia in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/services/documentation/archives/multimedia/?id_page=13|title=Definition of Intangible Heritage|first=|last=LOMITKO|date=1 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage; 
* Performing arts; 
* Social practices, rituals and festive events; 
* Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; 
* Traditional craftsmanship

[[File:No-Maske Zo-onna Museum Rietberg RJP 4024.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Noh]] mask; Japan was the first country to [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|introduce legislation]] to protect and promote its [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible heritage]]&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;]]

[[Cultural heritage]] in general consists of the products and processes of a [[culture]] that are preserved and passed on through the generations. Some of that heritage takes the form of [[cultural property]], formed by tangible artefacts such as buildings or works of art. Many parts of culture, however are intangible, including [[song]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[skill]]s, cuisine, crafts and festivals. They are forms of culture that can be recorded but cannot be touched or stored in physical form, like in a museum, but only experienced through a vehicle giving expression to it. These cultural vehicles are called "Human Treasures" by the [[UN]].

According to the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) – or living heritage – is the mainspring of humanity's [[cultural diversity]] and its maintenance a guarantee for continuing creativity.  It is defined as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral history===
Intangible cultural heritage is slightly different from the discipline of [[oral history]], the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information (specifically, [[oral tradition]]), based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker.  ICH attempts to preserve cultural heritage 'with' the people or community by protecting the processes that allow traditions and shared knowledge to be passed on while oral history seeks to collect and preserve historical information obtained from individuals and groups.

===Food heritage===
With sustainable development gaining momentum as a priority of UNESCO heritage policies, an increasing number of food-related nominations are being submitted for inscription on the lists of the Convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frictions.hypotheses.org/184|title=At the UNESCO feast: introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mediterranean diet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=French|author=SILVA, A. J. M.|title=Le régime UNESCO (Discours et pratiques alimentaires en Méditerranée vol. III)|place=Charleston|editor=Create Space|year=2016|isbn=1532997116|url=https://www.academia.edu/27222415/Le_r%C3%A9gime_UNESCO_Discours_et_pratiques_alimentaires_en_M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e_vol._III_}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional Mexican cuisine and the Japanese dietary culture of washoku are just some examples of this booming phenomenon.

===Dance heritage===
The UNESCO lists of intangible cultural heritage also include a variety of dance genres, often associated with singing, music and celebrations, from all over the world. The lists include: celebratory and ritual dances, such as ‘Ma'di bowl lyre music and dance’ from Uganda and ‘Kalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan’ from India and social dances, such as rumba from Cuba. Also, some dances are localised and practised mainly in their country of origin, such as Sankirtana, a performing art that includes drumming and singing, from India. 

Other dance forms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddanceheritage.org/international-heritage/ Dance as a form of intangible heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;, however, even if they are officially recognised as heritage from their country of origin, are practised and enjoyed all over the world. For example, flamenco from Spain and tango, from Argentina and Uruguay, have a very international dimension. Dance is a very complex phenomenon, which involves culture, traditions, the use of human bodies, artefacts (such as costumes and props), as well as a specific use of music, space and sometimes light. As a result, a lot of tangible and intangible elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/drs.2016.0147 Lo Iacono, Valeria and Brown, David - ''Beyond Binarism: Exploring a Model of Living Cultural Heritage for Dance''. Dance Research Journal, Vol. 34, April 2016]
&lt;/ref&gt; are combined within dance, making it a challenging but extremely interesting type of heritage to safeguard.

===Digital heritage===
[[Digital heritage]] is a representation of heritage in the digital realm.

===Digital intangible heritage===

[[Digital intangible heritage]] is a sub-category of Intangible Cultural Heritage.&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71|title=Transmitting Al Ardha: Traditional Arab Sword Dance|first=Muqeem|last=Khan|date=1 March 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Heritage in the Digital Era|volume=4|issue=1|pages=71–86|via=multi-science.atypon.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral continuity==
[[Image:A traditional male folk group from Skrapar.JPG|thumb|Albanian polyphonic folk group wearing [[qeleshe]] and [[fustanella]] in [[Skrapar]]]]
Intangible cultural heritage is passed orally within a community, and while there may be individuals who are known tradition bearers, ICH is often broader than one individual's own skills or knowledge.  A 2006 report by the government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] said, regarding oral culture in their area, "The processes involved in the continuation of this traditional knowledge constitute one of the most interesting aspects of our living heritage. Each member of the community possesses a piece of the shared knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Tremolada|first2=Riccardo|title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights|journal=Transnational Dispute Management|date=March 15, 2014|volume=11|issue=2|ssrn=2472339|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial knowledge is passed on during community activities, frequently without any conscious attention to the process."&lt;ref&gt;"Creative Newfoundland and Labrador: The Blueprint for Development and Investment in Culture" Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2006, page 34.|url=http://www.tcii.gov.nl.ca/artsculture/pdf/culturalplan2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Prior to the UNESCO Convention, efforts had already been made by a number of states to safeguard their intangible heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/databases/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |author=Deacon, Harriet (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] |year=2004 |isbn=0796920745 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, with its [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties]], was the first to introduce legislation to preserve and promote intangible as well as tangible culture: [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Intangible Cultural Properties]] are [[Cultural Properties of Japan|designated]] and "holders" recognized of these craft and performance traditions, known informally as [[Living National Treasures of Japan|Living National Treasures]].&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultural Protection Policy in Korea: Intangible Cultural Properties and Living National Treasures |author=Yang Jongsung |publisher=Jimoondang International |year=2003 |isbn=1931897050 |pages=33ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1-2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, including South Korea ([[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea]]), the Philippines, the United States, Thailand, France, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Poland, have since created similar programs.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;

In 2003 UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.  This went into effect on 20 April 2006.  The Convention recommends that countries and scholars develop inventories of ICH in their territory, as well as work with the groups who maintain these ICH to ensure their continued existences; it also provides for funds to be voluntarily collected among UNESCO members and then disbursed to support the maintenance of recognized ICH.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; UNESCO has also created other intangible culture programs, such as a list called Proclamation of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].  This list began in 2001 with 19 items and a further 28 were listed in 2003 and another 43 in 2005. In part, the original list was seen as a way to correct the imbalance in the World Heritage List, since it excluded many Southern Hemisphere cultures which did not produce monuments or other physical cultural manifestations.&lt;ref name = Kurin/&gt; It was superseded in 2008 by the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].

Recently there has been much debate over protecting intangible cultural heritage through intellectual property rights, as well as the desirability to do so through this legal framework and the risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2705698 Farah, Paolo Davide and Tremolada, Riccardo ''Conflict between Intellectual Property Rights and Human Rights: A Case Study on Intangible Cultural Heritage'' (December 19, 2015). Oregon Law Review, Vol. 94, No. 1, 2015]
&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28431">An '''isotopic signature''' (also '''isotopic fingerprint''') is a ratio of non-radiogenic '[[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotopes]]', stable [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic isotopes]], or unstable [[radioactive]] isotopes of particular elements in an investigated material. The ratios of isotopes in a sample material are measured by [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]] against an [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|isotopic reference material]]. This process is called [[isotope analysis]].

==Stable isotopes==

{{Hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]}} &lt;!--Can't get superscript to work otherwise with template: {{Main article|δ13C}} --&gt;

{{Algal carbon isotopes}}
For example, different sources and sinks of [[methane]] have different affinity for the [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] isotopes, which allows distinguishing between different sources by the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio in methane in the air. In [[geochemistry]], [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleoceanography]] this ratio is called [[Δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]. The ratio is calculated with respect to [[Δ13C#Reference standard|Pee Dee Belemnite]] (PDB) [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|standard]]:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\delta \ce{^{13}C}_\mathrm{sample} = \left(\frac{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\ce{sample}}{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\mathrm{standard}} - 1\right) \cdot 1000&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil;

Similarly, carbon in inorganic [[carbonate]]s shows little isotopic fractionation, while carbon in materials originated by [[photosynthesis]] is depleted of the heavier isotopes. In addition, there are two types of plants with different biochemical pathways; the [[C3 carbon fixation]], where the isotope separation effect is more pronounced, [[C4 carbon fixation]], where the heavier &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is less depleted, and [[Crassulacean Acid Metabolism]] (CAM) plants, where the effect is similar but less pronounced than with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants. Isotopic fractionation in plants is caused by physical (slower diffusion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in plant tissues due to increased atomic weight) and biochemical (preference of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C by two enzymes: [[RuBisCO]] and [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]]) factors.&lt;ref&gt;Park S. Nobel (2009) Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. P.410.&lt;/ref&gt; The different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the [[food chain]], thus it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or an animal consists primarily of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[rice]], [[wheat]], [[soybeans]], [[potato]]es) or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[maize|corn]], or [[corn-fed beef|corn-fed]] [[beef]]) by [[isotope analysis]] of their flesh and bone collagen (however, to obtain more accurate determinations, carbon isotopic fractionation must be also taken into account, since several studies have reported significant &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C discrimination during biodegradation of simple and complex substrates).&lt;ref name="FernandezCadisch2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=Irene|last2=Cadisch|first2=Georg|title=Discrimination against13C during degradation of simple and complex substrates by two white rot fungi|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|volume=17|issue=23|year=2003|pages=2614–2620|issn=0951-4198|doi=10.1002/rcm.1234|pmid=14648898|bibcode=2003RCMS...17.2614F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FernandezMahieu2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=I.|last2=Mahieu|first2=N.|last3=Cadisch|first3=G.|title=Carbon isotopic fractionation during decomposition of plant materials of different quality|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=17|issue=3|year=2003|pages=n/a|issn=0886-6236|doi=10.1029/2001GB001834|bibcode = 2003GBioC..17.1075F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, marine fish contain more &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C than freshwater fish, with values approximating the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants respectively.&lt;!--bones are composed of an inorganic matrix and organic collagen --&gt;

The ratio of carbon-13 and carbon-12 isotopes in these types of plants is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = O'Leary | first1 = M. H.| title = Carbon Isotopes in Photosynthesis| jstor = 1310735| journal = BioScience| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 328–336| year = 1988| doi = 10.2307/1310735}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -16 to -10 ‰
* CAM plants: -20 to -10 ‰
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -33 to -24 ‰

[[Limestone]]s formed by precipitation in [[sea]]s from the atmospheric carbon dioxide contain normal proportion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. Conversely, [[calcite]] found in [[salt dome]]s originates from carbon dioxide formed by [[oxidation]] of [[petroleum]], which due to its plant origin is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted. The layer of limestone deposited at the Permian extinction 252 Mya can be identified by the 1% drop in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope]] is important in distinguishing [[biosynthetized]] materials from man-made ones. [[Biogenic]] chemicals are derived from biospheric carbon, which contains &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Carbon in artificially made chemicals is usually derived from [[fossil fuel]]s like [[coal]] or [[petroleum]], where the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C originally present has decayed below detectable limits. The amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C currently present in a sample therefore indicates the proportion of carbon of biogenic origin.

===Nitrogen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ15N|δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]}}
[[Isotopes of nitrogen#Nitrogen-15|Nitrogen-15]], or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, is often used in [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[medicine|medical]] research, for example in the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]] to establish the nature of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meselson |first=M. |last2=Stahl |first2=F.

Nitrogen-15 is extensively used to trace [[Ammoniacal nitrogen#Mineral nitrogen|mineral nitrogen]] compounds (particularly [[fertilizers]]) in the environment.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tissues and [[hair]] of [[vegan]]s therefore contain significantly lower δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N than the bodies of people who eat mostly meat. Similarly, a terrestrial diet produces a different signature than a marine-based diet. Isotopic [[hair analysis|analysis of hair]] is an important source of information for [[archaeology|archaeologists]], providing clues about the ancient diets and differing cultural attitudes to food sources.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P.

A number of other environmental and physiological factors can influence the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the [[food web]] (i.e. in plants) or at the level of individual animals. For example, in arid regions, the [[nitrogen cycle]] tends to be more 'open' and prone to the loss of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, increasing δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in soils and plants.&lt;ref name="Handley"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Handley |first=L.L |last2=Austin |first2=A.

===Oxygen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]}}
Oxygen comes in three variants, but the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]] is so rare that it is very difficult to detect (~0.04% abundant).&lt;ref name="iupac_abundance"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Pure Appl.

As the vapor tension depends on the concentration of dissolved salts, the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratio shows correlation on the [[salinity]] and temperature of water. As oxygen gets built into the shells of [[calcium carbonate]] secreting organisms, such sediments prove a chronological record of temperature and salinity of the water in the area.

Oxygen isotope ratio in atmosphere varies predictably with time of year and geographic location; e.g. there is a 2% difference between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-rich precipitation in Montana and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-depleted precipitation in Florida Keys. This variability can be used for approximate determination of geographic location of origin of a material; e.g. it is possible to determine where a shipment of [[uranium oxide]] was produced. The rate of exchange of surface isotopes with the environment has to be taken in account.&lt;ref name="nucfor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3FnEOg8tS4C&amp;pg=PA399&amp;dq=%22nuclear+forensics%22&amp;num=50&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nuclear%20forensics%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Forensic Analysis - Kenton J.

==Radiogenic isotopes==

===Lead isotopes===
Lead consists of four stable [[isotopes of lead|isotopes]]: &lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, and &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb. Local variations in [[uranium]]/[[thorium]]/[[lead]] content cause a wide location-specific variation of isotopic ratios for lead from different localities. Lead emitted to the atmosphere by industrial processes has an isotopic composition different from lead in minerals. Combustion of [[gasoline]] with [[tetraethyllead]] additive led to formation of ubiquitous micrometer-sized lead-rich [[particulate]]s in car exhaust [[smoke]]; especially in urban areas the man-made lead particles are much more common than natural ones. The differences in isotopic content in particles found in objects can be used for approximate geolocation of the object's origin.&lt;ref name="nucfor"/&gt;

==Radioactive isotopes==
[[Hot particles]], radioactive particles of [[nuclear fallout]] and [[radioactive waste]], also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) can be determined by [[mass spectrometry]] or by [[gamma ray spectrometer|gamma spectrometry]]. For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cobalt|Co]] and &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]. The [[Chernobyl accident]] did not release these particles but did release &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;[[Antimony|Sb]] and &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cerium|Ce]]. Particles from underwater bursts will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;[[Plutonium|Pu]]/&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu are also different for fusion and fission [[nuclear weapon]]s, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin.

==Applications==

===Archaeological studies===
In archaeological studies, stable isotope ratios have been used to track diet within the time span formation of analyzed tissues (10-15 years for bone collagen and intra-annual periods for tooth enamel bioapatite) from individuals; "recipes" of foodstuffs (ceramic vessel residues); locations of cultivation and types of plants grown (chemical extractions from sediments); and migration of individuals (dental material).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Forensics===
With the advent of stable [[isotope ratio mass spectrometry]], isotopic signatures of materials find increasing use in [[forensics]], distinguishing the origin of otherwise similar materials and tracking the materials to their common source. For example, the isotope signatures of plants can be to a degree influenced by the growth conditions, including moisture and nutrient availability. In case of synthetic materials, the signature is influenced by the conditions during the chemical reaction. The isotopic signature profiling is useful in cases where other kinds of profiling, e.g. characterization of [[impurities]], are not optimal. Electronics coupled with scintillator detectors are routinely used to evaluate isotope signatures and identify unknown sources.

A study was published demonstrating the possibility of determination of the origin of a common brown [[pressure sensitive adhesive|PSA]] [[packaging tape]] by using the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic signature of the backing polymer, additives, and [[adhesive]].&lt;ref&gt;James F. Carter, Polly L. Grundy, Jenny C. Hill, Neil C. Ronan, Emma L.

Measurement of carbon isotopic ratios can be used for detection of [[adulteration]] of [[honey]].

'''James P. Carse''' is [[Professor Emeritus]] of history and literature of religion at [[New York University]]. His book ''[[Finite and Infinite Games]]'' was widely influential.  Although Dr. Carse may not believe in God, he describes himself as religious "in the sense that I am endlessly fascinated with the unknowability of what it means to be human, to exist at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Paulson |authorlink= |title=Religion is poetry |url=http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |agency= |work= |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=23 December 2008 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818182051/http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |archivedate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carse's recent work on religion and belief provides a foil to [[New Atheism]].  His ideas about religion and belief were featured on the May 4, 2012 [[CBC Radio]] series [[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]] titled [http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2012/05/03/after-atheism-new-perspectives-on-god-and-religion-part-4/ After Atheism: New Perspectives on God and Religion, Part 4].

==Life==
He was born in Wembley, Middlesex and educated at the [[Latymer Upper School]], Hammersmith and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = RS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27sawyer%27%29| title = Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as a Technical Officer with the Meteorological Office involved in weather forecasting for RAF stations during World War II and was then sent to India to be involved in co-ordinating the meteorological service in South-East Asia Air Command (1943). On his return he joined the staff of the Forecast Research Division, Dunstable at its inception in 1949.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Work==
He was Chairman of British National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics (1961), Assistant Director (Dynamical Research) at the Meteorological Office, Director of Research at the Meteorological Office (1965–1976) and President of the Commission for Atmospheric Sciences, World Meteorological Organisation (1968–1973). He retired in 1976.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Publications==
Sawyer published the study ''Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5366/abs/239023a0.html|title=Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect|date=1 September 1972|journal=Nature|volume=239|pages=23–26|doi=10.1038/239023a0|author=J.

==Awards==
He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1962. His candidature citation read "''Mr. Sawyer is recognised as a leader in meteorological research, both in this country and abroad. With F.H. Bushby he devised the well-known 'baroclinic' model for numerical forecasting, using electronic computation, which is rightly regarded as a landmark in this difficult subject. His work on the characteristics of fronts is one of the few successful attempts to deal quantitatively with the dynamics (as distinct from the kinematices) of these important phenomena. He has done markedly original work on dynamical similarity in meteorology and his recent numerical calculations of air flow over mountains are believed to be the first realistic computations of their kind. In addition, he has contributed much to the detailed analysis of the salient features of large-scale atmospheric disturbances, including studies of the rainfall of depressions, the behavious of the tropopause, and the cloud systems associated with fronts. His work is characteristic of the younger school of dynamical meteorologists, and is doing much to make meteorology a more exact science than hitherto''."&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

He was also a Fellow of the Meteorological Society (FRMetS) and their president from 1963 to 1965. He was awarded their [[Symons Gold Medal]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1371797/John-Sawyer.html|title= John Sawyer|work= The Telegraph|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LIMSI Building Orsay.jpg|thumb|LIMSI's building.]]
The '''Computer Science Laboratory for Mechanics and Engineering Sciences''' ('''LIMSI''') is a [[CNRS]] pluri-disciplinary laboratory in [[Orsay]], France near [[Paris]] gathering academics and scholars from various scientific fields: primarily from the Engineering and Information Sciences, but also from Cognitive Science and Linguistics.
From the administrative point of view, LIMSI (UPR3251) is a [[CNRS]] laboratory tightly associated with the [[University of Paris-Sud|Paris-Sud University]]. LIMSI also develops collaborations with other universities and engineering schools within the [[University of Paris-Saclay|University Paris-Saclay]].

==History==
The laboratory was created in 1972 under the leadership of Lucien Malavard, with an initial focus on Numerical Fluid Mechanics, Acoustics, and Signal Processing. Its research themes have progressively been expanded to Speech and Image Processing, then to a growing number of themes related to Human-Computer Communication and Interaction on the one hand; to Thermics and Energetics on the other hand.

== Research themes ==
Its research is organized in four main themes, spanning the activities of 9 research groups:
- Fluid Mechanics remains one of its main research areas, with an expertise in the development of advanced numerical methodologies associated to experiments in academic configurations: the AERO and  ETCM groups both contribute activities related to large-scale numerical simulations, to uncertainty quantification, to the characterization of fluid dynamics (instabilities, turbulence), to the control of flows, and to multiphysic couplings;
- Energetics and the study of Mass and Heat Transfer: this theme carries out fundamental research aimed at a better understanding of transfer phenomena in convection and radiation, in multiphasic and oscillating conditions, and at extremely low temperatures. The ETCM and  TSF groups also study the analysis of large thermic systems with application to housing and solar energy.
- Natural Language Processing, applied to spoken, written, and signed language is another main research theme at LIMSI. Three  groups, TLP, ILES and  AA contribute to a wide spectrum of activities ranging from acoustic signal processing, automatic speech recognition and synthesis, to semantic modeling and fine-grained question answering, also including multimedia indexing, machine translation, the analysis and generation of emotions in speech and text, and information extraction;
- research in Human-Machine Interaction aims at a deeper understanding and modeling of interactions between humans and artificial systems in various contexts, and along various modalities. Four research teams are concerned: AMI focuses mostly on tangible, haptic, gestural and ambient interactions, whereas CPU is more focused on verbal and non-verbal interactions with virtual agents; interactions in virtual and augmented reality environments are studied primarily in the  AMI, VENISE and AA research groups.

Many research groups share similar or related interests and application domains; this is especially the case for collaborative research projects at the frontier between Science and Arts. VIDA is a tranverse action with the mission to coordinate LIMSI's activities in this domain, as well as to organize events, for instance under the umbrella of the "[http://www.ladiagonale-paris-saclay.fr/ Diagonale Paris-Saclay]".

The methods for inquiry draw from a number of academic disciplines such as [[women's studies]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]] studies, indigenous epistemologies, [[queer studies]], psychological anthropology, and [[ethnography]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This field shares theoretical similarities to critical [[disability studies]], psychopolitics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cresswell &amp; Spandler|first=|date=2013|title=The Engaged Academic: Academic Intellectuals and the Psychiatric Survivor Movement|url=|journal=[[Social Movement Studies]]|volume=12 |issue=2|pages=138–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frankfurt School|critical social theory]]. The academic movement formed, in part, as a response to [[Recovery approach|recovery]] movements, which many mad studies scholars see as being "co-opted" by mental health systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins and scope ==
Richard A. Ingram, a senior research fellow in the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]] (2007), has been credited with coining the phrase "Mad Studies" at the First Regional Graduate/Undergraduate Student Disability Studies Conference at Syracuse University on May 3, 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Richard A.|date=|title=Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together|url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/IJ/article/view/1680/1327|journal=Intersectionalities|volume= 5| issue =  3 (Special Issue) Mad Studies: Intersections with Disability Studies, Social Work, and ‘Mental Health’|pages=11–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://player.fm/series/mentally-sound-radio-show/mentally-sound-show-9-131115-6dHUzEqRe4Rzci2m|title=Mentally Sound Radio Show #9|last=McGowan|first=Victoria|date=November 13, 2015|work=Mentally Sound Radio Show|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an academic article entitled "Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together," Ingram points to a number of theorists who created the intellectual groundwork for the field, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]], [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article, Peter Beresford names Canadian scholars at the forefront of this academic field: "Mad studies has been pioneered by Ryerson and [[York University|York]] Universities in Toronto, with key figures such as mental health survivors, activists and educators David Reville and Geoffrey Reaume and academics Kathryn Church and Brenda LeFrancois."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/07/mad-studies-voice-of-sanity-psychiatry|title=Mad studies brings a voice of sanity to psychiatry|last=Beresford|first=Peter|date=October 7, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Alex Gillis summarizes the spread of mad studies programs in a November 2015 article: "Soon after Ryerson and York launched mad studies courses in the early 2000s, similar courses began in Simon Fraser University’s department of sociology and anthropology, and more recently at Memorial University’s school of social work, Queen’s University’s school of kinesiology and health studies, and the history departments at Trent University and the University of Winnipeg. A few universities in England, Scotland and the Netherlands launched courses in the past two years, using Canadian courses as models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/mad-studies/|title=The Rise of Mad Studies|last=Gillis|first=Alex|date=November 3, 2015|work=University Affairs|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dimensions of this emerging field may include research on the "social construction of 'mental illness, normalizing imperatives of the state and medicine, rapidly expanding nosologies (categories of pathology) for mental illness, collusion(s) of pharmaceutical corporations and professional associations within psychiatry, connections between ecocide and mental stress, psychiatrization of nonhuman animals, representation(s) of madness in media, history of consumer/survivor movement(s), and the rise and fall of mental treatments within scientific, medical, and lay communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ashevilleradicalmentalhealth.wordpress.com/mad-studies/|title=Mad Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=Asheville Radical Mental Health Collective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">{{Italic title}}
'''''Op. cit.''''' is an abbreviation of the [[Latin phrase]] ''{{lang|la|opus citatum}}'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th"&gt;{{Chicago 16th |pp=670 |at=14.31 |title=‘''Op. cit.''’ and ‘''loc. cit.''’ |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the work cited".&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt;

==Overview==
The abbreviation is used in an [[endnote]] or [[footnote]] to refer the reader to a previously cited work, standing in for repetition of the full title of the work.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; ''Op. cit.'' thus refers the reader to the [[bibliography]], where the full citation of the work can be found, or to a full citation given in a previous footnote. ''Op. cit.'' should never therefore be used on its own, which would be meaningless, but most often with the author's surname,&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; or another brief clue as to which work is referred to. For example, given a work called ''The World of Salamanders'' (1999) by Jane Q. Smith, the style would typically be "Smith ''op. cit.''", usually followed by a page number, to refer the reader to a previous full citation of this work (or with further clarification such as "Smith 1999, ''op. cit.''" or "Smith, ''World of Salamanders'', ''op. cit.''", if two sources by that author are cited).  Given names or initials are not needed unless the work cites two authors with the same surname, as the whole purpose of using ''op. cit.'' is economy of text.  For works without an individually named author, the title can be used, e.g. "''CIA World Fact Book'', ''op. cit.''"  As usual with foreign words and phrases, ''op. cit.'' is typically given in italics.  The variant ''[[Loc. cit.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''loco citato'' meaning "in the place cited",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; has been used for the same purpose but also indicating the same page not simply the same work; it is now rarely used or recognized.

The ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition, claims that ''op. cit.'' and ''loc. cit.'' are "rightly falling into disuse", and "instead uses the short-title form",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; e.g. the form ''World of Salamanders'', to use the example above.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 2"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.28: Short form for titles", pp.&amp;nbsp;668&amp;ndash;669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various different styles call for other alternatives, such as a reference to the author's surname and publication year, e.g. "Smith 1999".&lt;!--Is this MLA style? A citation for it needs to be added from a major style guide, common as it may be.--&gt;

''Op. cit'' is contrasted with ''[[ibid.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin adverb ''ibidem'', meaning "in the same place; in that very place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |author=Marchant and Charles, eds. |edition=260th |chapter=ibidem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 3"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.29: ‘''Ibid.''’", p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers the reader to the title of the work in the preceding footnote. The easily confused ''[[idem]]'' (sometimes abbreviated ''id.''), the Latin definitive pronoun meaning "the same"&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.30: ‘''Idem''’", pp.&amp;nbsp;669&amp;ndash;630.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used on occasion (especially in legal writing) within footnotes, and is a stand-in for the last-cited author, rather than title.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4" /&gt; The Latin adverb ''[[supra (grammar)|supra]]'', meaning "above" means simply "see above" and can therefore be somewhat imprecise.

==Examples==
Footnotes 9 to 15:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.
* (11) G. Wiki, ''Towards a More Perfect Speech'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 354.
* (12) G. Wiki, ''I Say, You Say'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 35.
* (13) Millan, ''op. cit.'', p. 5.
* (14) Wiki 2000, ''op. cit.'', p. 66.
* (15) Wiki, ''I Say, You Say op. cit.'', p. 4.

Reference number 13 refers to the last cited work by the author R. Millan, and hence, it is the same as in number 9 (R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar''), although the page referred to is different. Reference number 14 refers to reference number 10, ''Language and Its Uses'' (because the work was published in 2000), page 66. Reference number 15 refers to reference number 12: there are two works by Wiki published in 2003 so you must use the title.

For the short-title form:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.
* (11) G. Wiki, ''Towards a More Perfect Speech'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 354
* (12) G. Wiki, ''I Say, You Say'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 35
* (13) ''Art of Latin Grammar'', p. 5.
* (14) ''Language and Its Uses'', p. 66.
* (15) ''I Say, You Say'', p. 4.

This is exactly the same as the long form above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''''opus gallicum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Gallic work") was a technique of construction whereby precise holes were created in stone masonry for the insertion of wooden beams to create a wooden infrastructure. The technique was so named because, though its presence is attested in protohistoric times, its use was common enough in [[Gaul]] to merit mention in [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[De Bello Gallico|De bello Gallico]]'' and was frequently employed in the [[Merovingian]] era. The technique was imported by the [[Normans]] into the [[Molise]], where it was used extensively in the raising of [[castle]]s in a short time. Gaulish masons are even known to have brought the technique from Merovingian Francia to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and employed it in [[church architecture]]. 

The ''opus gallicum'' served not only as an infrastructural base, but also a [[Superstructure|superstructural]] binding element designed to strengthen the masonry. While the arrangement of some of the holes found in preserved structures is often perplexing, leaving doubt as to the exact function of the beams, modern scholarship has largely moved away from the theory that the ''opus gallicum'' was a rare and inefficient method. Overall the technique was not uncommon in the Middle Ages.

''Organization &amp; Environment'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]] and the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]]. In 2017, the journal's impact factor was 5.049. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipscience-help.thomsonreuters.com/incitesLiveJCR/JCRGroup/titleSuppressions.html |title=Title Suppressions |website=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Under the editorship of founding co-editor John M. Jermier and a number of editors, the journal took an interdisciplinary direction, playing host to a variety of perspectives including critical organization theory and radical ecology. Collaboration between members of the Organization and Natural Environment section of the [[Academy of Management]] and the Section on Environment and Technology section of the [[American Sociological Association]] was at the heart of the journal's framework. During this period ''O&amp;E'' became a prominent outlet for [[environmental sociology]], publishing articles both from established and world-renowned environmental thinkers and younger scholars who would later become leaders in environmental sociology. The journal played an important role in increasing the influence of environmental sociology within the larger discipline and by 2011 its impact factor had grown to rival that of distinguished general interest journals such as ''[[Social Problems (journal)|Social Problems]]'' and ''[[Social Forces (journal)|Social Forces]]''.&lt;ref name=JermierYears&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=John Bellamy |title=Organization &amp; Environment: The Jermier Years, 1997-2012 |journal=American Sociological Association Environment and Technology Newsletter |date=Fall 2012 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.envirosoc.org/newsletters.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editorial transition ==
As of December 1, 2012, ''Organization &amp; Environment'' is edited by Aragon-Correa and Starik. From this point, the journal aims to conduct "rigorous explorations and analyses of the multiple connections between the management of organizations and any of the relevant dimensions of [[sustainability]]"; targeted contributors are "sustainability management, policy, and related social science researchers".&lt;ref name=transition&gt;[http://oae.sagepub.com/site/includefiles/Editorial_Transition_Web_OE_081912.pdf "Editorial Transition in Organization &amp; Environment", Sagepub.com.] Accessed: August 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

The December 2012 editorial transition was strongly criticized by (now former) [[editorial board]] members of ''Organization &amp; Environment'' as an "editorial coup" on the part of Sage and GRONEN.&lt;ref name=JermierYears /&gt;&lt;ref name=withdrawal&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Collective Withdrawal from Editorial Review Board of ''Organization &amp; Environment''|url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/10/18/editors-resign-from-leading-environment-journal/|publisher=Climate &amp; Capitalism|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, the editorial transition was decided upon and carried out by Sage independently of its editors/editorial board, without their prior knowledge or acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Monthly Review |date=October 2012 |volume=64 |issue=7  |title=Notes from the Editors  |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2012/10/01/mr-064-05-2012-09 |accessdate=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed out that this is not the first time accusations of this sort have been leveled at Sage. In 2009, political scientists charged that the editor of [[Political Theory (journal)|''Political Theory'']] was replaced unilaterally and unfairly. Sage was forced to apologize, admitting that "whatever" they had done "was done without consulting the scholars on the editorial board of the journal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jaschik, Scott |title=Who Controls Journals? |date=July 7, 2009 |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/07/sage |work=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that the pro-corporate/management stance of GRONEN stands in stark contrast to the work of previous ''O&amp;E'' editors and writers, many of whom tended strongly to emphasize the role of corporate power in perpetuating environmental degradation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In a statement published in October 2012, 25 members of the editorial board of ''O&amp;E'' resigned in protest of the transition.&lt;ref name=withdrawal /&gt;

The '''philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law''' are the fields of [[legal philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology (Catholic Church)|theological]] ([[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]]), and [[legal theory|legal scholarship]] which concern the place of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the nature of the [[Catholic Church]], both as a natural and as a supernatural entity. [[Philosophy]] and theology shape the concepts and self-understanding of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] as the law of both a human organization and as a supernatural entity, since the [[Catholic Church]] believes that [[Jesus Christ]] instituted the church by direct divine command, while the fundamental theory of canon law is a meta-discipline of the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11&gt;Ladislas Orsy, "Towards a Theological Conception of Canon Law" (published in Jordan Hite, T.O.R., &amp; Daniel J. Ward, O.S.B., "Readings, Cases, Materials in Canon Law: A Textbook for Ministerial Students, Revised Edition" (Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1990), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of canon law==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
A triple species of human [positive] law is distinguished: ecclesiastical or canon law, [[law|civil law]], and the [[jus gentium|law of nations]]. Canon law {jus canonicum} and civil law differ among themselves partly by nature of origin, partly by nature of object, and partly by nature of end:
*They differ in origin: for the origin of the civil power is from God the author of nature; while the origin of the ecclesiastical power is from God the contributor of supernatural grace.
*They differ in object: because canon law regulates spiritual and sacred matters, while civil law regulates matters temporal and political. 
*They differ in end: for canon law especially aims at the eternal happiness {beatitudo} of people; civil law, however, aims at their temporal happiness {felicitas}.&lt;ref&gt;Bargilliat, M., “Prælectiones Juris Canonici—Tomus Primus” (Parisiis: Berche et Tralin, Editores, 1909), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotelian-Thomistic jurisprudence===
{{Main article|Politics (Aristotle)|Treatise on Law|Determinatio}}
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|right|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
Although canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Treatise on Law|Thomistic]] [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://www.canonlaw.info/ main page]. Accessed 9 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly discusses the place of canon law in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''&lt;ref&gt;J. Budziszewski, [http://www.undergroundthomist.org/the-architecture-of-law-according-to-thomas-aquinas The Architecture of Law According to Thomas Aquinas]; accessed 14 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (a small section of his ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]''). However, Aquinas himself was influenced by canon law; the fourth clause of his famous 4-part definition of law—the requirement of [[promulgation]]—is taken from the canonists, and the ''sed contra'' of his article on promulgation cites [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] (the "Father of Canon Law") as an authority.&lt;ref&gt;Blackfriars ''Summa Theologiæ'' Vol. 28, pg. 16 [notes by Thomas Gilby O.P. on ''Summa'' Ia-IIæ, q. 90, a. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to René A. Wormser,
{{quote|[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s service in assembling and co-ordinating [sic.] the mass of canon law was of inestimable value; but the man to whom the Church and canon law are most indebted is [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]...And it is largely upon the thesis of St. Thomas Aquinas that the Church jurists went so far as to pronounce that laws were of absolutely no force whatever if they were not for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;René A. Wormser, The Story of the LAW, pp. 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the term "law" (''lex'') is never explicitly defined in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgray.org/comps/book1.html JGray.org], accessed June-8-2013&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] in defining law as "...an ordinance of reason for the common good, [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by the one who is in charge of the community"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6X.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §1976], citing ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' I-II, 90, 4&lt;/ref&gt; and reformulates it as "...a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6T.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] §1951&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, dispute the applicability of the [[Treatise on Law|Thomistic definition of law]] (''lex'') to canon law, arguing that its application would impoverish [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiology]] and corrupt the very supernatural end of canon law.&lt;ref&gt;Exegetical Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, Vol. I, pg. 261-262 (commentary on 1983 CIC, Book I, Title I)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jus Publicum Ecclesiasticum''===
With the birth of the omni-competent sovereign nation-state in the seventeenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson &amp; McHenry, ''The American Federal Government'', pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed exclusive jurisdiction over all its citizens, the dual or [[concurrent jurisdiction]] of the Catholic Church and the sovereign state was intellectually and legally challenged. In the new legal and politico-religious climate in the period following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the newly formed [[sovereign state]]s of Europe claimed more jurisdiction over areas of law and legal practice which had traditionally been under the jurisdiction of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; In this post-Reformation period of political change, [[canon lawyer|canonical jurists]] sought to defend within the categories of the [[public law]] the right of the [[Catholic Church]] to make and enforce [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the name, ''jus publicum ecclesiasticum''—"public ecclesiastical law". 

{{quote|The Church is not merely a corporation (''collegium'') or part .of civil society. Hence, the maxim is false, "''Ecclesia est in statu''," or, the Church is placed under the power of the state. The Church is rightly named a Sovereign State. This is proved by Soglia 13 in these words : "''Ex defmitione Pufiendorfii, Status est conjunctio plurium hominum, quae imperio per homines administrate, sibi proprio, et aliunde non dependente, continetur. Atqui ex institutione Christi, Ecclesia est conjunctio hominum, quae per homines, hoc est, per Petrum et Apostolos, eorumque successores administratur cum imperio sibi proprio, nee aliunde dependente ; ergo Ecclesia est Status''."&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsofeccles01smituoft/elementsofeccles01smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, 9th Edition] (1895), §185&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The justification of the legal powers of the Catholic Church would now be defended along the lines of the [[sovereign state]]'s justification for its own legal powers, and the Catholic Church would be considered a concurrent and complementary ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'' in the realm of the supernatural end of man to that of the civil [[sovereign state]] in the realm of the natural end of man.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Communitas Perfecta''===
{{main article|Communitas Perfecta}}
Many canonists, in the years preceding the [[Second Vatican Council]], considered the justification and basis for canon law being a true legal system to be that the [[Catholic Church]] was established by [[Jesus Christ]] as a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'', and as such was a true human society which had the right to make human law.

{{quote|“…the Church is a Sovereign State, that is, a perfect and supreme society, established by our Lord for the purpose of leading men to heaven. We say, a society; now what is a society? Speaking in general, it is a number of persons associated together, in order to attain, by united efforts, some common end. We say, perfect; because she is complete of herself, and therefore has within her own bosom all the means sufficient to enable her to attain her end. We say, supreme, because she is subject to no other society on earth. Like every society, the Church is an external organization. For she is composed of human beings, who have a body as well as a soul. She is, in fact, by the will of her divine Founder, a community, an association of men, governed by men. Like every external organization, the Church must be governed by laws and regulations that will enable her to fulfill her mission and attain her end. The aim and end of the Church is the worship of God and the salvation of souls. Any action or omission, therefore, on the part of her members, which hinders her from carrying out her mission or reaching her end, and, consequently, whatever contravenes the regulations made by her concerning the worship of God and the sanctification of her children, is punishable by her. For God, having given her a mission, also gave her the means or the power to fulfill it. Hence she can establish, in fact has established, laws, and regulations, obligatory on her members. If the members violate those laws, they not only sin against God, but they offend also against the order, discipline, laws, or regulations established by the Church.”&lt;ref&gt;REV. S. B. SMITH, D.D., [https://archive.org/stream/elementsecclesia03smituoft/elementsecclesia03smituoft_djvu.txt ELEMENTS OF ECCLESIASTICAL LAW, VOL. III. ECCLESIASTICAL PUNISHMENTS. SECOND, REVISED EDITION.] (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1888), §§1658-1659 (accessed 31 January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Della Rocca asserts that it is a "fundamental principle of canon law which insists on the right of the Church as a [[Communitas Perfecta|perfect society]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In the context of ecclesiological discourse, "perfect society (''societas perfecta'')" and "perfect community (''[[Communitas Perfecta|communitas perfecta]]'')" have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine, particularly in the field of legislation, the limits of its own power."&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Pope Benedict XV]], in his [[apostolic constitution]] promulgating the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]], attributes the legislative authority of the church to it being founded by Jesus Christ with all the requirements for a ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XV, ap. const. ''Providentissima Mater Ecclesia'', (found in Peters [trans.], ''1917 Code of Canon Law'', pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology of canon law==
{{see also|Catholic theology|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
In the decades following the [[Second Vatican Council]], many canonists called for a more theological, rather than philosophical, conception of canon law,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71&gt;Errázuriz, ''Fundamental Theory'', pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the "triple relationship between theology, philosophy, and canon law".&lt;ref name=Orsy11/&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], in his address of 21 January 2012 before the [[Roman Rota]], taught that canonical laws can only be [[interpretation (canon law)|interpreted]] and fully understood within the [[Catholic Church]] in the light of her mission and [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] structure.&lt;ref name=Rota2012&gt;Benedict XVI, ''2012 Roman Rota Address'':&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Were one to tend to identify Canon Law with the system of the laws of the canons, the understanding of that which is juridical in the Church would essentially consist in the comprehending of that which the legal texts establish. At first glance, this approach would appear to hold Human Law entirely in value. However the impoverishment which this conception would bring about becomes manifest: with the practical oblivion of the [[Natural Law]] and of the [[Divine Positive Law]], as well as the vital relationship of every Law with the communion and the mission of the Church, the work of the interpreter becomes deprived of vital contact with ecclesial reality.&lt;ref name=Rota2012/&gt;
}}
Some authors conceive of canon law as ''essentially'' theological and the discipline of canon law as a theological subdiscipline,&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt; but Msgr. Carlos José Errázuriz contends that "in a certain sense, all postconciliar canonical scholarship has shown a theological concern in the widest sense, that is, a tendency to determine more clearly the place of the juridical in the mystery of the Church."&lt;ref name=Fundamental71/&gt;

===Ecclesiological inspiration of the 1983 Code===
{{Main article|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In view of the decision to reform the existing Code, the [[Second Vatican Council]], in the [[decree (canon law)|decree]] ''[[Optatam totius]]'' (§16), ordered that "the teaching of canon law...should take into account the mystery of the Church, according to the [[apostolic constitution|dogmatic constitution]] ''[[Lumen Gentium|De Ecclesia]]''...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651028_optatam-totius_en.html ''Optatam totius''] §16, accessed 14 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]] was structured according to the [[Roman law]] division of "norms, persons, things, procedures, penalties", while the 1983 Code, in total contrast, was deliberately given a much more doctrinal-theological structure. [[John Paul II]] described the ecclesiological inspiration of the new code of canon law in this way:&lt;ref name=sacrae&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html Sacrae Disciplinae Leges], accessed Jan-11-2013&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The instrument, which the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code]] is, fully corresponds to the [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|nature of the Church]], especially as it is proposed by the teaching of the Second Vatican Council in general, and in a particular way by its [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]] teaching. Indeed, in a certain sense, this new Code could be understood as a great effort to translate this same doctrine, that is, the [[Second Vatican Council|conciliar]] ecclesiology, into canonical language. If, however, it is impossible to translate perfectly into [[jurisprudence of canon law|canonical language]] the conciliar image of the Church, nevertheless, in this image there should always be found as far as possible its essential point of reference.&lt;ref name=sacrae/&gt;
}}
Thus the 1983 Code is configured, as far as possible, according to the "mystery of the Church", the most significant divisions—Books II, III, and IV—corresponding to the ''munus regendi'', the ''munus sanctificandi'', and the ''munus docendi'' (the "missions" of governance, of worship/sanctification, and of teaching) which in turn derive from the kingly, the priestly and the prophetic roles or functions of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Confer "CANON LAW AND COMMUNIO

==Fundamental theory of canon law==
{{see also|Ecclesiology (Catholic Church)}}
The fundamental theory of canon law is a discipline covering the basis of canon law in the very nature of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental theory is a newer discipline that takes as is object "the existence and nature of what is [[justice|juridical]] in the [[Catholic Church|Church of Jesus Christ]]."&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[discipline (academia)|discipline]] seeks to provide a theoretical basis for the coexistence and complementarity of canon law and the [[Catholic Church]], and it seeks to refute the "canonical antijuridicism" (the belief that ''law of the church'' constitutes a contradiction in terms; that ''law'' and ''church'' are radically incompatible)&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; of the various heretical movements and of the [[Protestant Reformation]]&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 7, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, and on the other, the antijuridicism deriving from a belief that all law is identifiable with the law of the state; that in order to be true law, the state must be its maker.&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline seeks to better explain the nature of law in the church and engages in theological discussions in post-[[Vatican II|conciliar]] Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 59 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to combat "postconciliar antijuridicism".&lt;ref&gt;Errázuriz M., ''Fundamental Theory,'' 62&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''physical symbol system''' (also called a [[formal system]]) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions.

The '''physical symbol system hypothesis''' ('''PSSH''') is a position in the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]] formulated by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]. They wrote:
{{Quotation|"A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]}}
This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is [[sufficient]] for intelligence).&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nilsson|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas),  [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|pp=15&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is called the [[computational theory of mind]], associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has been criticized strongly by various parties, but is a core part of AI research. A common critical view is that the hypothesis seems appropriate for higher-level intelligence such as playing chess, but less appropriate for commonplace intelligence such as vision. A distinction is usually made between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]].

== Examples ==
Examples of physical symbol systems include:
* [[Formal logic]]: the symbols are words like "and", "or", "not", "for all x" and so on. The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false.  The processes are the rules of logical deduction.
* [[Elementary algebra|Algebra]]: the symbols are "+", "×", "''x''", "''y''", "1", "2", "3", etc. The expressions are equations. The processes are the rules of algebra, that allow one to manipulate a mathematical expression and retain its truth.
* A [[digital computer]]: the symbols are zeros and ones of computer memory, the processes are the operations of the [[CPU]] that change memory.
* [[Chess]]: the symbols are the pieces, the processes are the legal chess moves, the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board.

The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
* Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are [[thought]]s. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
* A running [[artificial intelligence]] program: the symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.

== Arguments in favor of the physical symbol system hypothesis ==
=== Newell and Simon ===
Two lines of evidence suggested to [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence: the development of [[artificial intelligence]] programs and psychological experiments on human beings.

First, in the early decades of AI research there were a number of very successful programs that used high level symbol processing, such as [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s [[General Problem Solver]] or [[Terry Winograd]]'s [[SHRDLU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=130&amp;ndash;148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] named this kind of AI research "Good Old Fashioned AI" or [[GOFAI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expert system]]s and [[logic programming]] are descendants of this tradition. The success of these programs suggested that symbol processing systems could simulate any intelligent action.

And second, [[Psychology|psychological]] experiments carried out at the same time found that, for difficult problems in logic, planning or any kind of "puzzle solving", people used this kind of symbol processing as well. AI researchers were able to simulate the step by step problem solving skills of people with computer programs. This collaboration and the issues it raised eventually would lead to the creation of the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=91&amp;ndash;129, 170&amp;ndash;174}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This type of research was called "[[cognitive simulation]]".) This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of high level symbols.

=== Symbols vs. signals ===
In Newell and Simon's arguments, the "symbols" that the hypothesis is referring to are physical objects that represent things in the world, symbols such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that have a recognizable [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] or [[denotation]] and can be [[compositionality|composed]] with other symbols to create more complex symbols.

However, it is also possible to interpret the hypothesis as referring to the simple abstract 0s and 1s in the memory of a digital computer or the stream of 0s and 1s passing through the perceptual apparatus of a robot.  These are, in some sense, symbols as well, although it is not always possible to determine exactly what the symbols are standing for. In this version of the hypothesis, no distinction is being made between "symbols" and "signals", as [[David Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau]] explain.&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994&gt;

Cognitive Science 18(2):345&amp;ndash;353, 1994.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/pubs/simon-reply-www.ps.gz
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this interpretation, the physical symbol system hypothesis asserts merely that intelligence can be ''digitized''. This is a weaker claim. Indeed, [[David Touretzky|Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau|Pomerleau]] write that if symbols and signals are the same thing, then  "[s]ufficiency is a given, unless one is a dualist or some other sort of mystic, because physical symbol systems are [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]]."&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994/&gt; The widely accepted [[Church&amp;ndash;Turing thesis]] holds that any [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]] system can simulate any conceivable process that can be digitized, given enough time and memory. Since any digital computer is [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]], any digital computer can, in theory, simulate anything that can be digitized to a sufficient level of precision, including the behavior of intelligent organisms. The necessary condition of the physical symbol systems hypothesis can likewise be finessed, since we are willing to accept almost any signal as a form of "symbol" and all intelligent biological systems have signal pathways.

== Criticism ==

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] has identified four main "themes" or grounds in which the physical symbol system hypothesis has been attacked.&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"/&gt;
#The "erroneous claim that the [physical symbol system hypothesis] lacks [[symbol grounding]]" which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action.
#The common belief that AI requires non-symbolic processing (that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance).
#The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that "computation as it is currently understood, does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence".
#And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless, most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies.

=== Dreyfus and the primacy of unconscious skills ===
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] attacked the necessary condition of the physical symbol system hypothesis, calling it "the psychological assumption" and defining it thus:
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dreyfus refuted this by showing that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation. Experts solve problems quickly by using their intuitions, rather than step-by-step trial and error searches. Dreyfus argued that these unconscious skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950&amp;ndash;952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120&amp;ndash;132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50&amp;ndash;51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Searle and his Chinese room ===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

[[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program (or any physical symbol system) could not be said to "understand" the symbols that it uses; that the symbols themselves have no meaning or semantic content, and so the machine can never be truly intelligent from symbol manipulation alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269&amp;ndash;271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brooks and the roboticists ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence, situated approach|Moravec's paradox}}
In the sixties and seventies, several laboratories attempted to build [[robot]]s that used symbols to represent the world and plan actions (such as the [[Stanford Cart]]). These projects had limited success. In the middle eighties, [[Rodney Brooks]] of [[MIT]] was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all. Brooks (and others, such as [[Hans Moravec]]) discovered that our most basic skills of motion, survival, perception, balance and so on did not seem to require high level symbols at all, that in fact, the use of high level symbols was more complicated and less successful.

In a 1990 paper [http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf Elephants Don't Play Chess], robotics researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks 1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectionism ===
{{Main|Connectionism}}

=== Embodied philosophy ===
{{Main|Embodied philosophy}}

[[George Lakoff]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]] and others have argued that our abstract skills in areas such as [[mathematic]]s, [[ethic]]s and [[philosophy]] depend on unconscious skills that derive from the body, and that conscious symbol manipulation is only a small part of our intelligence.

{{Distinguish|Neoplasm}}
{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}
'''Pleonasm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|ə|n|æ|z|ə|m}}; {{ety|grc|''{{linktext|πλεονασμός}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleonasmós}}}}, {{ety||''{{linktext|πλέον}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleon}}|more; too much}}) is the use of more [[word]]s or [[morpheme|parts of words]] than are necessary or sufficient for clear expression: for example ''black darkness'' or ''burning fire''. Such [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] is, by traditional [[rhetoric]]al criteria, a manifestation of [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. However, pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or because the phrase has already become established in a certain form.

==Usage==
Most often, ''pleonasm'' is understood to mean a word or phrase which is useless, [[cliché]]d, or repetitive, but a pleonasm can also be simply an unremarkable use of [[idiom]]. It can aid in achieving a specific linguistic effect, be it social, poetic, or literary. In particular, pleonasm sometimes serves the same function as rhetorical repetition—it can be used to reinforce an idea, contention, or question, rendering writing clearer and easier to understand. Further, pleonasm can serve as a [[redundancy check]]: If a word is unknown, misunderstood, or misheard, or the medium of communication is poor—a wireless telephone connection or sloppy handwriting—pleonastic phrases can help ensure that the entire meaning gets across even if some of the words get lost.

===Idiomatic expressions===
Some pleonastic phrases are part of a language's idiom, like "tuna fish" and "safe haven" in American [[English language|English]]. They are so common that their use is unremarkable and often even unnoticeable for native speakers, although in many cases the redundancy can be dropped with no loss of meaning.

When expressing possibility, English speakers often use potentially pleonastic expressions such as ''It may be possible'' or ''maybe it's possible'', where both terms (verb ''may''&amp;nbsp;/ adverb ''maybe'' and adjective ''possible'') have the same meaning under certain constructions. Many speakers of English use such expressions for possibility in general, such that most instances of such expressions by those speakers are in fact pleonastic. Others, however, use this expression only to indicate a distinction between ontological possibility and epistemic possibility, as in "Both the ontological possibility of X under current conditions and the ontological impossibility of X under current conditions are epistemically possible" (in [[Propositional logic|logical]] terms, "I am not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of proposition X, but I am likewise not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of the negation of X"). The habitual use of the double construction to indicate possibility ''per se'' is far less widespread among speakers of most other languages (except in Spanish; see examples); rather, almost all speakers of those languages use one term in a single expression:
* French: ''Il est possible'' or ''il peut arriver''.
* Romanian: ''Este posibil'' or ''se poate întâmpla''.
* Typical Spanish pleonasms
** ''Voy a subir arriba'' - I am going to go up upstairs, "''arriba''" not being necessary.
** ''Entra para adentro'' - Go in inside, "''para adentro''" not being necessary.

* Turkish has many pleonastic constructs because certain verbs necessitate objects:
** ''yemek yemek'' - to eat food.
** ''yazı yazmak'' - to write writing.
** ''dışarı çıkmak'' - to go out outside.
** ''içeri girmek'' - to go in inside.
** ''oyun oynamak'' - to play game.

In a [[verb framing|satellite-framed]] language like English, [[verb phrase]]s containing [[grammatical particle|particle]]s that denote direction of motion are so frequent that even when such a particle is pleonastic, it seems natural to include it (e.g. "enter into").

===Professional and scholarly use===
Some pleonastic phrases, when used in professional or scholarly writing, may reflect a standardized usage that has evolved or a meaning familiar to specialists but not necessarily to those outside that discipline. Such examples as "null and void", "terms and conditions", "each and every" are [[legal doublet]]s that are part of [[Legal English|legally operative language]] that is often drafted into legal documents. A classic example of such usage was that by the [[Lord Chancellor]] at the time (1864), [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury|Lord Westbury]], in the English case of ''{{lang|la|ex parte}} Gorely'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ex p Gorely'', (1864) 4 De G L &amp; S 477.&lt;/ref&gt; when he described a phrase in an Act as "redundant and pleonastic". Although this type of usage may be favored in certain contexts, it may also be disfavored when used gratuitously to portray false erudition, obfuscate, or otherwise introduce verbiage. This is especially so in disciplines where imprecision may introduce ambiguities (such as the natural sciences).&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stylistic preference===
In addition, pleonasms can serve purposes external to meaning. For example, a speaker who is too terse is often interpreted as lacking ease or grace, because, in oral and sign language, sentences are spontaneously created without the benefit of editing. The restriction on the ability to plan often creates much redundancy. In written language, removing words not strictly necessary sometimes makes writing seem stilted or awkward, especially if the words are cut from an idiomatic expression.

On the other hand, as is the case with any literary or rhetorical effect, excessive use of pleonasm weakens writing and speech; words distract from the content. Writers wanting to conceal a thought or a purpose obscure their meaning with verbiage. [[William Strunk Jr]]. advocated concision in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (1918):

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.}}

Yet, one has only to look at [[Baroque]], [[Mannerist]], and [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] sources for different opinions.

===Literary uses===
* "This was the '''most''' unkind'''est''' cut of all." &amp;mdash;[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (Act 3, Scene 2,183).
* "I will be brief: your noble son is mad:/Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,/What is't but to be nothing else but mad?" &amp;mdash; ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 2, Scene 2)
* "Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as '''poodle dogs'''." &amp;mdash;[[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]''.
* "Let me tell you this, when social workers offer you, '''free, gratis and for nothing''', something to hinder you from swooning, which with them is an obsession, it is useless to recoil ..." &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]''.

==Types==
{{Original research section|date=September 2010}}
There are two kinds of pleonasm: '''syntactic pleonasm''' and '''semantic pleonasm'''.

===Syntactic pleonasm===
[[Syntax|Syntactic]] pleonasm occurs when the [[grammar]] of a language makes certain [[function word]]s optional. For example, consider the following [[English language|English]] sentences:

* "I know you're coming."
* "I know that you're coming."

In this construction, the [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''that'' is optional when joining a sentence to a [[verb]] phrase with ''know''. Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the word ''that'' is pleonastic in this case. By contrast, when a sentence is in spoken form and the verb involved is one of assertion, the use of ''that'' makes clear that the present speaker is making an indirect rather than a direct quotation, such that he is not imputing particular words to the person he describes as having made an assertion; the demonstrative adjective ''that'' also does not fit such an example. Also, some writers may use "that" for technical clarity reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Possible Worlds: an introduction to Logic and its Philosophy|year=1979|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/pw/index.htm|author=Norman Swartz &amp; Raymond Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, such as French, the word is not optional and should therefore not be considered pleonastic.

The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with subject pronouns. Since Spanish is a [[null-subject language]], which allows subject pronouns to be deleted when understood, the following sentences mean the same:

* "{{lang|es|Yo te amo.}}"
* "{{lang|es|Te amo.}}"

In this case, the pronoun {{lang|es|yo}} ('I') is grammatically optional; both sentences mean "I love you" (however, they may not have the same tone or ''intention''—this depends on [[pragmatics]] rather than grammar). Such differing but [[syntax|syntactically]] equivalent constructions, in many languages, may also indicate a difference in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]].

The process of deleting pronouns is called ''[[pro-drop language|pro-dropping]]'', and it also happens in many other languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], some&lt;!-- if not all --&gt; [[Slavic languages]], and the [[Lao language]].

In contrast, formal English requires an overt subject in each clause. A sentence may not need a subject to have valid meaning, but to satisfy the syntactic requirement for an explicit subject a pleonastic (or [[dummy pronoun]]) is used; only the first sentence in the following pair is acceptable English:

* "It's raining."
* "Is raining."

In this example the pleonastic "it" fills the subject function, however, it does not contribute any meaning to the sentence. The second sentence, which omits the pleonastic '''it''' is marked as ungrammatical although no meaning is lost by the omission.&lt;ref&gt;Haegeman, L. (1991). ''Introduction to Government and Binding Theory''. Blackwell Publishing. pp 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements such as "it", or "there" serving as empty subject markers are also called (syntactic) [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]]s, and also dummy pronouns. Compare:

* "There is rain."
* "Today is rain."

The pleonastic {{lang|fr|ne}} ({{lang|fr|ne pléonastique}}), expressing uncertainty in formal [[French language|French]], works as follows:
*"{{lang|fr|Je crains qu'il ne pleuve.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('I fear it may rain.')
*"{{lang|fr|Ces idées sont plus difficiles à comprendre que je ne pensais.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('These ideas are harder to understand than I thought.')

Two more striking examples of French pleonastic construction are the word {{lang|fr|aujourd'hui}} translated as 'today', but originally meaning "on the day of today", and the phrase {{lang|fr|Qu'est-ce que c'est?}} meaning 'What's that?' or 'What is it?', while literally it means "What is it that it is?".

There are examples of the pleonastic, or dummy, negative in English, such as the construction, heard in the New England region of the United States, in which the phrase "So don't I" is intended to have the same positive meaning as "So do I."&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Laurence R. ''Universals of Human Language'', Volume I, edited by Joseph H. Greenberg, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Jim P. (2008), "''So''-inversion as Polarity Focus"; in Michael Grosvald and Dianne Soares (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 38th Western Conference on Linguistics''; Fresno, California: University of California Press; pp. 304-317&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Robert South]] said, "It is a pleonasm, a figure usual in [[Bible|Scripture]], by a multiplicity of expressions to signify one notable thing",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ukIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA368|chapter=Sermon XIII Preached at St. Mary's, Oxford, on Sept. 12, 1658 |title=Five additional volumes of sermons preached upon several occasions,|volume=8|first=Robert |last=South|date=1744|page=368|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was observing the [[Biblical Hebrew]] poetic propensity to repeat thoughts in different words, since written Biblical Hebrew was a comparatively early form of written language and was written using oral patterning, which has many pleonasms. In particular, very many verses of the [[Psalms]] are split into two halves, each of which says much the same thing in different words. The complex rules and forms of written language as distinct from spoken language were not as well-developed as they are today when the books making up the [[Old Testament]] were written.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter J., ''Orality and Literacy (New Accents)'', p. 38, {{ISBN|0-415-28129-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, John C. ''Doing Our Own Thing'', p. 19. {{ISBN|1-59240-084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[parallelism (rhetoric)]].

This same pleonastic style remains very common in modern poetry and songwriting (e.g., "Anne, with her father&amp;nbsp;/ is out in the boat&amp;nbsp;/ riding the water&amp;nbsp;/ riding the waves&amp;nbsp;/ on the sea", from [[Peter Gabriel]]'s "Mercy Street").

====Types of syntactic pleonasm====
* ''Overinflection'': Many languages with [[inflection]], as a result of convention, tend to inflect more words in a given phrase than actually needed in order to express a single grammatical property. Take for example the German, ''Die alten Frauen sprechen''. Even though the plural form of the noun tells us the grammatical number of the noun phrase, the German language still dictates that the definite article, attributive adjective, and the verb must all also express the plural. Not all languages are quite as redundant however, and will permit inflection for number when there is an obvious numerical marker, as is the case with Hungarian, which does have a plural proper, but would express ''two flowers'' as ''two flower''. (The same is the case in [[Celtic languages]], where numerical markers precede singular nouns.) The main contrast between Hungarian and other tongues such as German or even English (to a lesser extent) is that in either of the latter, expressing plurality when already evident is not optional, but mandatory; making the neglect of these rules result in an ungrammatical sentence. As well as for number, our aforementioned German phrase also overinflects for grammatical case.
* ''[[Double negative|Multiple negation]]'': In some languages, repeated [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] may be used for emphasis, as in the English sentence, "There ai'''n't nothing''' wrong with that". While a literal interpretation of this sentence would be "There is not nothing wrong with that," i.e. "There is something wrong with that," the intended meaning is, in fact, the opposite: "There is nothing wrong with that" or "There isn't anything wrong with that." The repeated negation is used pleonastically for emphasis. However, this is not always the case. In the sentence "I do'''n't not''' like it," the repeated negative may be used to convey ambivalence ("I neither like nor dislike it") or even affirmation ("I ''do'' like it"). (Rhetorically, this becomes the device of [[litotes]]; it can be difficult to distinguish litotes from pleonastic double negation, a feature which may be used for [[irony|ironic]] effect.) Although the use of "double negatives" for emphatic purposes is sometimes discouraged in standard English, it is mandatory in other languages like Spanish or French. For example, the Spanish phrase {{lang|es|No es nada}} ('It is nothing') contains both a negated verb ("no es") and another negative, the word for nothing ("nada").
* ''Multiple affirmations'': In English, repeated affirmation can be used to add emphasis to an affirmative statement, just as repeated negation can add emphasis to a negative one. A sentence like ''I '''do''' love you'', with a stronger intonation on the ''do'', uses double affirmation. This is because all languages, by default, automatically express their sentences in the affirmative{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and must then alter the sentence in one way or another to express the opposite. Therefore, the sentence ''I love you'' is ''already'' affirmative, and adding the extra ''do'' only adds emphasis and does not change the meaning of the statement.
* ''Double possession'': The [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]] of English, as with ''a friend of mine'', although seemingly pleonastic, and therefore has been stigmatized, has a long history of use by careful writers and has been analyzed as either a [[partitive]] genitive or an [[appositive]] genitive.
* ''Multiple quality gradation'': In English, different [[degrees of comparison]] ([[comparative]]s and [[superlative]]s) are created through a morphological change to an adjective (e.g. "prettier", "fastest") or a syntactic construction (e.g. "more complex", "most impressive"). It is thus possible to combine both forms for additional emphasis: "more bigger" or "bestest". This may be considered ungrammatical, but is common in informal speech for some English speakers. "The most unkindest cut of all" is from Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar''. Musical notation has a repeated Italian superlative in ''[[wikt:fortississimo|fortississimo]]'' and ''[[wikt:pianississimo|pianississimo]]''.

:Not all uses of constructions such as "more bigger" are pleonastic, however. Some speakers who use such utterances do so in an attempt, albeit a grammatically unconventional one, to create a non-pleonastic construction: A person who says "X is more bigger than Y" may, in the context of a conversation featuring a previous comparison of some object Z with Y, mean "The degree by which X exceeds Y in size is greater than the degree by which Z exceeds Y in size". This usage amounts to the treatment of "bigger than Y" as a single grammatical unit, namely an adjective itself admitting of degrees, such that "X is more bigger than Y" is equivalent to "X is more bigger-than-Y than Z is." Another common way to express this is: "X is even bigger than Z."

===Semantic pleonasm===
Semantic pleonasm is a question more of style and usage than of grammar&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Bergen, Evans, Cor Nelia, and others, (1957), ''A dictionary of contemporary American usage'', Random House&lt;/ref&gt;. Linguists usually call this ''redundancy'' to avoid confusion with syntactic pleonasm, a more important phenomenon for theoretical [[linguistics]]. It usually takes one of two forms: Overlap or prolixity.

'''Overlap''': One word's semantic component is subsumed by the other:
* "Receive a '''free gift''' with every purchase."
* "I ate a '''tuna fish''' sandwich."
* "The plumber fixed our '''hot''' water '''heater'''." (This pleonasm was famously attacked by American comedian [[George Carlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |at="'‘George Carlin at USC'’ (1978)" section |title=Divine Comedy: 25 Best Stand-Up Specials and Movies |first1=Steve |last1=Ciabattoni |first2=David |last2=Fear |first3=Tim |last3=Grierson |first4=Matthew |last4=Love |first5=Noel |last5=Murray |first6=Scott |last6=Tobias |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Penske Business Media |date=29 July 2015 |access-date=27 July 2018|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/divine-comedy-25-best-stand-up-specials-and-movies-70696/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not truly redundant; a device that increases the temperature of cold water to room temperature would also be a water heater, although it did not heat hot water.)
* ''The '''Big''' Friendly '''Giant'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'' (title of a children's book by [[Roald Dahl]]), a giant is inherently big

'''Prolixity''': A phrase may have words which add nothing, or nothing logical or relevant, to the meaning.
* "I'm going '''down''' south."&lt;br /&gt;(South is not really "down", it is just drawn that way on maps by convention.)
* "You can't seem to face '''up to''' the facts."
* "He '''entered into''' the room."
* "Every '''mother's''' child" (as in 'The Christmas Song' by Nat King Cole', also known as 'Chestnuts roasting...')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Christmas Song by Nat King Cole|url=https://genius.com/Nat-king-cole-the-christmas-song-lyrics|website=Lyrics|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. (Being a child, or a human at all, generally implies being the child of/to a mother. So the redundancy here is used to broaden the context of the child's curiosity regarding the sleigh of Santa Claus, including the concept of maternity. The full line goes: "And every mother's child is gonna spy, to see if reindeer really know how to fly". One can furthermore argue that the word "mother" is included for the purpose of lyrical flow, adding two syllables, which make the line sound complete, as "every child" would be to short to fit the lyrical/rhyme scheme. )
* "What therefore God hath joined '''together''', let no man put asunder."
* "He raised '''up''' his hands in a gesture of surrender."
* "Where are you '''at'''?"
* "located" or similar before a [[preposition]]: the preposition contains the idea of locatedness and does not need a servant.
* "the actual house itself" for "the house", and similar: unnecessary re-specifiers.
* "Actual fact": fact.
* "On a daily basis": daily.
* "On a --ly basis" or "on a -- basis": --ly.
* "This particular item": this item.
* "Different" or "separate" after numbers: for example:
** "4 different [[species]]" are merely "4 species", as two non-different species are together one same species.
** "9 separate cars": cars are always separate. (However, in "a discount if you buy ten different items", "different" has meaning, because if the ten items include two packets of frozen peas of the same weight and brand, those ten items are not all different.)
*"Despite the fact that": although

An expression like "tuna fish", however, might elicit one of many possible responses, such as:
# It will simply be accepted as '''synonymous''' with "tuna".
# It will be perceived as '''redundant''' (and thus perhaps silly, illogical, ignorant, inefficient, dialectal, odd, and/or intentionally humorous).
# It will imply a '''distinction'''. A reader of "tuna fish" could properly wonder: "Is there a kind of tuna which is not a fish? There is, after all, a dolphin mammal and a [[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]." This assumption turns out to be correct, as a "tuna" can also mean a [[opuntia|prickly pear]].&lt;ref name="MW Tuna"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuna |title=tuna |work=Merriam-Webster.com |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "tuna fish" is sometimes used to refer to the flesh of the animal as opposed to the animal itself (similar to the distinction between ''beef'' and ''cattle'').&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt;
# It will be perceived as a verbal clarification, since the word "tuna" is quite short, and may, for example, be misheard as "tune" followed by an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], or (in dialects that [[arhotic|drop the final ''-r'' sound]]) as "tuner".

Careful speakers and writers to are aware of pleonasms, especially with cases such as "tuna fish", which is normally used only in some dialects of [[American English]], and would sound strange in other variants of the language, and even odder in translation into other languages.

Similar situations are:
*"Ink pen" instead of merely "pen" in the southern United States, where "pen" and "pin" are pronounced similarly.
*"Extra accessories" which must be ordered separately for a new camera, as distinct from the accessories provided with the camera as sold.

Not all constructions that are typically pleonasms are so in all cases, nor are all constructions derived from pleonasms themselves pleonastic:
* "Put that glass '''over there''' on the table."&lt;br /&gt; This could, depending on room layout, mean "Put that glass on the table across the room, not the table right in front of you"; if the room were laid out like that, most English speakers would intuitively understand that the distant, not immediate table was the one being referred to; however, if there were only one table in the room, the phrase would indeed be pleonastic. Also, it could mean, "Put that glass on that certain spot on the table"; thus, in this case, it is ''not'' pleonastic.
* "I'm going '''way down''' South."&lt;br /&gt; This may imply "I'm going much farther south than you might think if I didn't stress the southerliness of my destination"; but such phrasing is also sometimes—and sometimes jokingly—used pleonastically when simply "south" would do; it depends upon the context, the intent of the speaker/writer, and ultimately even on the expectations of the listener/reader.

===Morphemic pleonasm===
{{original research|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Morpheme]]s, not just words, can enter the realm of pleonasm: Some word-parts are simply optional in various languages and dialects. A familiar example to American English speakers would be the allegedly optional "-al-", probably most commonly seen in "publically" vs. "publicly"—both spellings are considered correct/acceptable in American English, and both pronounced the same, in this dialect, rendering the "publically" spelling pleonastic in US English; in other dialects it is "required", while it is quite conceivable that in another generation or so of American English it will be "forbidden". This treatment of words ending in "-ic", "-ac", etc., is quite inconsistent in US English—compare "maniacally" or "forensically" with "stoicly" or "heroicly"; "forensicly" doesn't look "right" in any dialect, but "heroically" looks internally redundant to many Americans. (Likewise, there are thousands of mostly American Google search results for "eroticly", some in reputable publications, but it does not even appear in the 23-volume, 23,000-page, 500,000-definition ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), the largest in the world; and even American dictionaries give the correct spelling as "erotically".) In a more modern pair of words, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] dictionaries say that "electric" and "electrical" mean exactly the same thing. However, the usual adverb form is "electrically". (For example, "The glass rod is electrically charged by rubbing it with silk".)

Some{{who|date=January 2016}} (mostly US-based) [[prescriptive grammar]] pundits would say that the "-ly" not "-ally" form is "correct" in any case in which there is no "-ical" variant of the basic word, and vice versa; i.e. "maniacally", not "maniacly", is correct because "maniacal" is a word, while "publicly", not "publically", must be correct because "publical" is (arguably) not a real word (it does not appear in the ''OED''). This logic is in doubt, since most if not all "-ical" constructions arguably are "real" words and most have certainly occurred more than once in "reputable" publications, and are also immediately understood by any educated reader of English even if they "look funny" to some, or do not appear in popular dictionaries. Additionally, there are numerous examples of words that have very widely accepted extended forms that have skipped one or more intermediary forms, e.g. "disestablishmentarian" in the absence of "disestablishmentary" (which does not appear in the ''OED''). At any rate, while some US editors might consider "-ally" vs. "-ly" to be pleonastic in some cases, the majority of other English speakers would not, and many "-ally" words are not pleonastic to anyone, even in American English.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
&lt;!-- This paragraph is pretty speculative, full of "some"s and "many"s and "in doubt"s --&gt;

The most common definitely pleonastic morphological usage in English is "[[irregardless]]", which is very widely criticized as being a non-word. The standard usage is "regardless", which is already negative; adding the additional negative ''ir-'' is interpreted by some as logically reversing the meaning to "with regard to/for", which is certainly not what the speaker intended to convey. (According to most dictionaries that include it, "irregardless" appears to derive from confusion between "regardless" and "irrespective", which have overlapping meanings.)

===Morphemic pleonasm in Mandarin Chinese===
There are several instances in Chinese vocabulary where pleonasms and [[cognate object]]s are present. Their presence usually indicate the plural form of the noun or the noun in formal context.
*{{lang|zh|书 – 书籍}} ('book(s)' – in general)
*{{lang|zh|纸 – 纸张}} ('paper, tissue, pieces of paper' – formal)

In some instances, the pleonasmic form of the verb is used with the intention as an emphasis to one meaning of the verb, isolating them from their idiomatic and figurative uses. But over time, the pseudo-object, which sometimes repeats the verb, is almost inherently coupled with the it.

For example, the word {{lang|zh|睡}} ('to sleep') is an intransitive verb, but may express different meaning when coupled with objects of prepositions as in "to sleep with". However, in Mandarin, {{lang|zh|睡}} is usually coupled with a pseudo-character {{lang|zh|觉}}, yet it is not entirely a cognate object, to express the act of resting.

*{{lang|zh|我要睡}} ('I want sleep'). Although such usage of {{lang|zh|睡}} is not found among native speakers of Mandarin and may sound awkward, this expression is grammatically correct and it is clear that {{lang|zh|睡}} means 'to sleep/to rest' in this context.
*{{lang|zh|我要睡觉}} ('I want to sleep') and {{lang|zh|我要睡了}} ('I'm going to sleep'). In this context, {{lang|zh|睡觉}} ('to sleep') is a complete verb and native speakers often express themselves this way. Adding this particle clears any suspicion from using it with any direct object shown in the next example:
*{{lang|zh|我要睡她}} ('I want to have sex with her') and {{lang|zh|我要和她睡}} ('I want to sleep with her'). When the verb follows an animate direct object {{lang|zh|她}} the meaning changes dramatically. The first instance is mainly seen in colloquial speech. Note that the object of preposition of "to have sex with" is the equivalent of the direct object of {{lang|zh|睡}} in Mandarin.

One can also find a way around this verb, using another one which does not is used to express idiomatic expressions nor necessitate a pleonasm, because it only has one meaning:
*{{lang|zh|我要就寝}} ('I want "to dorm{{"'}})
Nevertheless, {{lang|zh|就寝}} is a verb used in high-[[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] diction, just like English verbs with Latin roots.

There is no relationship found between Chinese and English regarding verbs that can take pleonasms and cognate objects. Although the verb ''to sleep'' may take a cognate object as in "sleep a restful sleep", it is a pure coincidence, since verbs of this form are more common in Chinese than in English; and when the English verb is used without the cognate objects, its diction is natural and its meaning is clear in every level of diction, as in "I want to sleep" and "I want to have a rest".

===Subtler redundancies===
In some cases, the redundancy in meaning occurs at a syntactic level above the word, such as at the phrase level:

: "It's [[déjà vu]] all over again."
: "I never make predictions, especially about the future."

The redundancy of these two well-known statements is deliberate, for [[humor]]ous effect. (See [[Yogi_Berra#Yogi-isms]].) But one does hear educated people say "my predictions about the future of politics" for "my predictions about politics", which are equivalent in meaning. While predictions are necessarily about the future (at least in relation to the time the prediction was made), the nature of this future can be subtle (e.g., "I predict that he died a week ago"—the prediction is about future discovery or proof of the date of death, not about the death itself). Generally "the future" is assumed, making most constructions of this sort pleonastic. The latter humorous quote above about not making predictions – by [[Yogi Berra]] – is not really a pleonasm, but rather an [[irony|ironic]] [[play on words]].

But "It's ''déjà vu'' all over again." could mean that there was earlier another ''déjà vu'' of the same event or idea, which has now arisen for a third time.

Redundancy, and "useless" or "nonsensical" words (or phrases, or morphemes) can also be inherited by one language from the influence of another, and are not pleonasms in the more critical sense, but actual changes in grammatical construction considered to be required for "proper" usage in the language or dialect in question. [[Irish English]], for example, is prone to a number of constructions that non-Irish speakers find strange and sometimes directly confusing or silly:

* "I'&lt;b&gt;m after&lt;/b&gt; put'''ting''' it on the table."&lt;br /&gt;('I [have] put it on the table.') This example further shows that the effect, whether pleonastic or only pseudo-pleonastic, can apply to words and word-parts, and multi-word phrases, given that the fullest rendition would be "I '''am after''' put'''ting''' it on the table".
* "Have a look at '''your''' man there."&lt;br /&gt;('Have a look at that man there.') An example of word substitution, rather than addition, that seems illogical outside the dialect. This common possessive-seeming construction often confuses the non-Irish enough that they do not at first understand what is meant. Even "'''Have a '''look at that man''' there'''" is arguably further doubly redundant, in that a shorter "Look at that man" version would convey essentially the same meaning.)
* "She's my wife''' so she is'''."&lt;br /&gt;('She's my wife.') Duplicate subject and verb, post-complement, used to emphasize a simple factual statement or assertion.

All of these constructions originate from the application of [[Irish Gaelic]] grammatical rules to the English dialect spoken, in varying particular forms, throughout the island.

Seemingly "useless" additions and substitutions must be contrasted with similar constructions that are used for stress, humor, or other intentional purposes, such as:

*"I abso'''-fuckin'-'''lutely agree!"&lt;br /&gt;([[tmesis]], for stress)
*"Topless'''-shmopless'''—nudity doesn't distract me."&lt;br /&gt;([[shm-reduplication]], for humor)

The latter of these is a result of Yiddish influences on modern English, especially [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] US English.

Sometimes editors and grammatical stylists will use "pleonasm" to describe simple wordiness. This phenomenon is also called [[prolixity]] or [[logorrhea (rhetoric)|logorrhea]]. Compare:

*"The sound of the [[loud music]] drowned out the sound of the burglary."
*"The loud music drowned out the sound of the burglary."
or even:
*"The music drowned out the burglary."

The reader or hearer does not have to be told that loud music has a sound, and in a newspaper headline or other abbreviated prose can even be counted upon to infer that "burglary" is a proxy for "sound of the burglary" and that the music necessarily must have been loud to drown it out, unless the burglary was relatively quiet (this is not a trivial issue, as it may affect the legal culpability of the person who played the music); the word "loud" may imply that the music should have been played quietly if at all. Many are critical of the excessively abbreviated constructions of "[[headline]]-itis" or "[[News style|newsspeak]]", so "loud [music]" and "sound of the [burglary]" in the above example should probably not be properly regarded as pleonastic or otherwise genuinely redundant, but simply as informative and clarifying.

Prolixity is also used simply to obfuscate, confuse, or euphemize and is not necessarily redundant or pleonastic in such constructions, though it often is. "Post-traumatic stress disorder" ([[shell shock]]) and "pre-owned vehicle" ([[used car]]) are both tumid euphemisms but are not redundant. Redundant forms, however, are especially common in business, political, and even academic language that is intended to sound impressive (or to be vague so as to make it hard to determine what is actually being promised, or otherwise misleading). For example: "This quarter, we are presently focusing with determination on an all-new, innovative integrated methodology and framework for rapid expansion of customer-oriented external programs designed and developed to bring the company's consumer-first paradigm into the marketplace as quickly as possible."

In contrast to redundancy, an [[oxymoron]] results when two seemingly contradictory words are adjoined.

===Other forms===
Redundancies sometimes take the form of foreign words whose meaning is repeated in the context:
*"We went to '''the El Restaurante restaurant'''."
*"'''The'' La Brea ''tar''' pits are fascinating."
*"Roast beef served '''with ''au'' ''jus'' sauce'''."
*"'''Please''' R.'''S.V.P.'''"
*"The Schwarz'''wald''' '''Forest''' is deep and dark."
*"The Drakens'''berg''' '''Mountains''' are in South Africa."
*Libre'''Office''' '''office''' suite.
*'''The ''hoi polloi.''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''
*I'd like to hav'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''e a '''''chai'' tea'''.

These sentences use phrases which mean, respectively, "the {{Not a typo|the}} restaurant restaurant", "the {{Not a typo|the}} tar tar", "with {{Not a typo|in}} juice sauce" and so on. However, many times these redundancies are necessary—especially when the foreign words make up a proper noun as opposed to a common one. For example, "We went to Il Ristorante" is acceptable provided the audience can infer that it is a restaurant (if they understand Italian and English it might likely, if spoken rather than written, be misinterpreted as a generic reference and not a proper noun, leading the hearer to ask "Which ristorante do you mean?" Such confusions are common in richly bilingual areas like [[Montreal]] or the [[American Southwest]] when people mix phrases from two languages at once). But avoiding the redundancy of the Spanish phrase in the second example would only leave an awkward alternative: "La Brea pits are fascinating".

Most find it best to not even drop articles when using proper nouns made from foreign languages:

*"The movie is playing at '''the El''' Capitan theater."

This is also similar to the treatment of definite and indefinite articles in titles of books, films, etc. where the article can—some would say ''must''—be present where it would otherwise be "forbidden":

* "Stephen King'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s''' ''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''The''' Shining'' is scary."&lt;br /&gt;(Normally, the article would be left off following a possessive.)
* "I'm having '''an ''An''&lt;nowiki /&gt;''' ''American Werewolf in London'' movie night at my place."&lt;br /&gt;(Seemingly doubled article, which would be taken for a [[stuttering|stutter]] or typographical error in other contexts.)

Some cross-linguistic redundancies, especially in placenames, occur because a word in one language became the title of a place in another (e.g., the [[Sahara Desert]]—"Sahara" is an English approximation of the word for "deserts" in Arabic). A supposed extreme example is [[Torpenhow Hill]] in [[Cumbria]], if etymologized as meaning "hill" in the language of each of the cultures that have lived in the area during recorded history, could be translated as "Hillhillhill Hill". See the [[List of tautological place names]] for many more examples.

Acronyms can also form the basis for redundancies; this is known humorously as [[RAS syndrome]] (for Redundant Acronym Syndrome Syndrome):

*"I forgot my '''PIN number''' for the '''ATM machine'''." So actually it says: "I forgot my Personal Identification Number number for the Automated Teller Machine machine."
*"I upgraded the '''RAM memory''' of my computer."
*"She is infected with the '''HIV virus'''."
*"I have installed a '''CMS system''' on my server."
*"Next year, I will hike the '''PCT Trail'''."

In all the examples listed above, the word after the acronym repeats a word represented in the acronym—respectively, "Personal Identification Number number", "Automated Teller Machine machine", "Random Access Memory memory", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus virus", "Content Management System system". (See [[RAS syndrome]] for many more examples.) The expansion of an acronym like PIN or HIV may be well known to English speakers, but the acronyms themselves have come to be treated as words, so little thought is given to what their expansion is (and "PIN" is also pronounced the same as the word "pin"; disambiguation is probably the source of "PIN number"; "SIN number" for "Social Insurance Number number" {{sic}} is a similar common phrase in Canada.) But redundant acronyms are more common with technical (e.g. computer) terms where well-informed speakers recognize the redundancy and consider it silly or ignorant, but mainstream users might not, since they may not be aware or certain of the full expansion of an acronym like "RAM".

Some redundancies are simply typographical. For instance, when a short inflexional word like "the" occurs at the end of a line, it is very common to accidentally repeat it at the beginning of the line, and a large number of readers would not even notice it.

Carefully constructed expressions, especially in poetry and political language, but also some general usages in everyday speech, may appear to be redundant but are not. This is most common with cognate objects (a verb's object that is cognate with the verb):
*"She '''slept''' a deep '''sleep'''."

Or, a classic example from Latin:
*''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' = "with change made to what needs to be changed" (an [[ablative absolute]] construction)

The words need not be etymologically related, but simply conceptually, to be considered an example of cognate object:
*"We '''wept''' '''tears''' of joy."

Such constructions are not actually redundant (unlike "She slept a sleep" or "We wept tears") because the object's modifiers provide additional information. A rarer, more constructed form is [[polyptoton]], the stylistic repetition of the same word or words derived from the same root:

* "...[T]he only thing we have to '''fear''' is '''fear''' itself."—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], "[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres49.html First Inaugural Address]", March 1933.
* "With eager '''feeding'''[,] '''food''' doth choke the '''feeder'''."—[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', II, i, 37.

As with cognate objects, these constructions are not redundant because the repeated words or derivatives cannot be removed without removing meaning or even destroying the sentence, though in most cases they could be replaced with non-related synonyms at the cost of style (e.g., compare "The only thing we have to fear is terror".)

==Semantic pleonasm and context==
In many cases of semantic pleonasm, the status of a word as pleonastic depends on context. The relevant context can be as local as a neighboring word, or as global as the extent of a speaker's knowledge. In fact, many examples of redundant expressions are not inherently redundant, but can be redundant if used one way, and are not redundant if used another way. The "up" in "climb up" is not always redundant, as in the example "He climbed up and then fell down the mountain." Many other examples of pleonasm are redundant only if the speaker's knowledge is taken into account. For example, most English speakers would agree that "tuna fish" is redundant because tuna is a kind of fish. However, given the knowledge that "tuna" can also refer a kind of edible prickly pear,&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt; the "fish" in "tuna fish" can be seen as non-pleonastic, but rather a disambiguator between the fish and the prickly pear.

Conversely, to English speakers who do not know Spanish, there is nothing redundant about "the La Brea tar pits" because the name "La Brea" is opaque: the speaker does not know that it is Spanish for "the tar". Similarly, even though [[Scuba diving|scuba]] stands for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus", a phrase like "the scuba gear" would probably not be considered pleonastic because "scuba" has been reanalyzed into English as a simple word, and not an acronym suggesting the pleonastic word sequence "apparatus gear". (Most do not even know that it is an acronym and do not spell it SCUBA or S.C.U.B.A. Similar examples are [[radar]] and [[laser]].)

'''Pro-war rhetoric''' is [[rhetoric]] or [[propaganda]] designed to convince its audience that war is necessary. The two main analytical approaches to pro-war rhetoric were founded by Ronald Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and [[Robert Ivie]], a Professor of Rhetoric and Public Communication and Culture at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University (Bloomington)]]. Reid's framework originated from inductively studying propaganda. Ivie uses a deductive approach based on the work of [[Kenneth Burke]], claiming that "a people strongly committed to the ideal of peace, but simultaneously faced with the reality of war, must believe that the fault for any such disruption of their ideal lies with others" (Ivie 279).

==Rhetorical framework of Ronald Reid==
According to Reid, pro-war rhetoric uses three appeals: territorial, ethnocentric, and optimistic..

===Territorial appeals===

Territorial appeals threaten the audience's "sense of territoriality" (Reid 260). The audience is more likely to support entering the war on the defensive rather than offensive side because of an actual or threatened invasion.

===Ethnocentric appeals===
Ethnocentric appeals create a dichotomy between the audience and the enemy. [[Ethnocentrism]] should be evoked to a "high level of emotional intensity" in attempt to complete two goals: hate the "inferior alien" and depict threats to cultural values (Reid 267).

The most common method of evoking ethnocentric appeals come in the form of Barbarism vs. Gallantry (Reid 269). It depicts the enemy's cultural values with evil characteristics, and the audience's as angelic.

===Optimistic appeal===
The optimistic appeal assures the audience that victory is inevitable should they enter into war.(Reid 282).

==Rhetorical framework of Robert Ivie==
According to Ivie, pro-war rhetoric identifies three topoi; force vs. freedom, irrational vs. rational, and aggression vs. defense.

===Force vs. freedom===
This tactic portrays to the audience that they are entering war to provide freedom, and the opponent to force their values upon others (Ivie 284). This is accomplished by implying that the opponent is violent, while the audience's nation is willing to negotiate (Ivie 284).

===Irrational vs. rational===
This [[topos]] holds that the enemy is portrayed as irrational, responding "more to animalistic drives than principles of law" (Ivie 288). The enemy has an unenlightened intellect, not based on reason. Rhetors use this argument to prove that when an enemy such as this threatens the well-being of the world, even for a nation committed to neutrality and peace, war is the only choice (Ivie 289).

===Aggression vs. defense===
This idea portrays the enemy as the voluntary aggressor and the nation of the audience as the passive victims of aggression, only entering into war to ensure security (Ivie 290). "While the savage has acted against order, the victim has been forced to respond in its defense" (Ivie 290). Ivie describes the actions as either "voluntary" and "initial" or "involuntary" and "defensive" (Ivie 290). The purpose of this topos is to lay the blame on the enemy and justify reasons for the victimized nation to engage in action.

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C. Becker |author2=Charlotte B.

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D.

==Formulation and detailed arguments==
{{see|Existence of God}}
The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities—omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence—then the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L.

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=Noûs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil and animal suffering===
{{See also|Wild animal suffering}}

The problem of evil has also been extended beyond human suffering, to include suffering of animals from cruelty, disease and evil.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van Inwagen|title=The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQhUrE8BYFIC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954397-7 |pages=120, 123–26, context: 120–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this problem includes animal suffering from natural evil, such as the violence and fear faced by animals from predators, natural disasters, over the history of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as the Darwinian problem of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Murray |title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZFNf9EwSSYC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-155327-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeidap193/&gt; after Charles Darwin who expressed it as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray2008"/&gt;

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

== Responses, defences and theodicies ==
Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεός (theós), "god" and δίκη (díkē), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"—showing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification—a morally or philosophically sufficient reason—for the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are—without knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P. McBrayer and Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-60797-8 |chapter=Chapter 31, for context see Chapters 29 and 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a rape or a murder of an innocent child is defended as having a God's purpose that a human being may not comprehend, but which may lead to lesser evil or greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt; This is called skeptical theism because the argument aims to encourage self-skepticism, either by trying to rationalize God's possible hidden motives, or by trying to explain it as a limitation of human ability to know.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"/&gt; The greater good defense is more often argued in religious studies in response to the evidential version of the problem of evil,&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trent Dougherty|author2=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55–58, 69–70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:• that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101–05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S. Feinberg |title=The Many Faces of Evil (Revised and Expanded Edition): Theological Systems and the Problems of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w_vM7DgWN4C |year=2004|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-1727-3 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a few scholars while accepting that "free will" applies in a human context, have posited an alternative "free creatures" defense, stating that animals too benefit from their physical freedom though that comes with the cost of dangers they continuously face.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering—such as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries—and it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314–39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158–168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49–52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107–26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn’t mean "were justified"; the blissful person’s disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn’t imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn’t thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M. Jorgensen and Samuel Newlands|title=New Essays on Leibniz's Theodicy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNPQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966003-2 |pages=64–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Chignell|author2=Terence Cuneo|author3=Matthew C.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371–81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response—called the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;—has been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"—profoundly hidden outweighing goods—defense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530–48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Bilimoria (1990), ‘ Hindu doubts about God&amp;nbsp;– Towards a Mimamsa Deconstruction’, International Philosophical Quarterly, 30(4), pp. 481–99&lt;/ref&gt; and the 11th-century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in ''Sribhasya''.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt;

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arthur Herman, karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil. It remains rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

====Judgment Day====
John Joseph Haldane's Wittgenstinian-Thomistic account of concept formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haldane|first1=J.J.|title=Atheism and Theism|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23259-1|pages=102–05|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Heidegger's observation of temporality's thrown nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19770-2|pages=426–27 (H 374) 458–72 (H 406–21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; imply that God's act of creation and God's act of judgment are the same act. God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE–c. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' – Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' – Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' – The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational—i.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian André Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189–90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan. By allowing opposition and temptations in mortality, God created an environment for people to learn, to develop their freedom to choose, and to appreciate and understand the light, with a comparison to darkness &lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_27_2015c1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-4-freedom-to-choose?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 4: Freedom to Choose |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Doctrines of the Gospel, Student Manual |year= 2000 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Purpose of Earth Life |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-10-the-purpose-of-earth-life?lang=eng |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

The problem of evil gained renewed interest among Jewish scholars after the moral evil of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The all-powerful, all-compassionate, all-knowing monotheistic God presumably had the power to prevent the Holocaust, but he didn't.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Jewish thinkers have argued that either God did not care about the torture and suffering in the world He created—which means He is not omnibenevolent, or He did not know what was happening—which means He is not omniscient.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel|title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=314–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution of Jewish people was not a new phenomenon, and medieval Jewish thinkers had in abstract attempted to reconcile the logical version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Holocaust experience and other episodes of mass extermination such as the [[Gulag]] and the [[Killing Fields]] where millions of people experienced torture and died, however, brought into focus the visceral nature of the evidential version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=219–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] neither denies the existence of evil, nor does it attempt to reconcile evil in a way attempted by monotheistic religions that assert the existence of an almighty, all powerful, all knowing, all benevolent God.&lt;ref name=koslowski10&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

Buddhism accepts that there is evil in the world, as well as [[Dukkha]] (suffering) that is caused by evil or because of natural causes (aging, disease, rebirth). The precepts and practices of Buddhism, such as [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Noble Eightfold Path]] aim to empower a follower in gaining insights and liberation ([[nirvana]]) from the cycle of such suffering as well as rebirth.&lt;ref name=koslowski10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52087-7 |pages=30–52 |chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Further, the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' are atypical texts of Buddhism, because they contradict the [[Anatta]] doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists, and that they do not represent mainstream Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–05, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–02|quote=Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term.

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain.

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pp. 177–79&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}} Madhvacharya was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic ''Tattvavada'' theory that proposed God and living beings along with universe as separate realities. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=270, 370–71, ''Quote:'' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

{{quote|But if this account is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is done away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing or able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God,
from what source then are evils or why does He not remove them?

}} where Lactantius critiques the argument. Epicurus's argument as presented by Lactantius actually argues that a god that is all-powerful and all-good does not exist and that the gods are distant and uninvolved with man's concerns. The gods are neither our friends nor enemies.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of good===
Several philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327264] Cahn, Stephen M. (1977). Cacodaemony. Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7247672&amp;jid=RES&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=7247664&amp;fromPage=cupadmin&amp;pdftype=6316268&amp;repository=authInst]  Law, Stephen (2010). The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353–73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, François {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

[[Semiotics]] is the study of [[meaning-making]] on the basis of signs. Semiotics of [[photography]] is the observation of symbolism used within photography or "reading" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way.
[[Roland Barthes]] was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|title=Rhetorical Theory|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, California|isbn=0-534-63918-6|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denotation==

[[Denotation]] refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is "what we see" in the picture or what is "there" in the picture.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=David|title=Photography: The Key Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Burg|isbn=978-1-84520-667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical.&lt;ref name=References&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Clive|title=The Spoken Image: Photography and Language|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-032-0|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents.&lt;ref name="Seiter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiter|first=Ellen|title=Semiotics, Structuralism, and Television|url=http://www.asu.edu/courses/lia394c/total-readings/Seiter--Semiotics.htm|work=Channels of Discourse, Reassembled: Television and Contemporary Criticism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literal meaning of the image.

==Connotation==

[[Connotation (Semiotics)]] is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics in the Visual Arts|year=2010|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-42-9|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc.&lt;ref name="Seiter"/&gt; It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"/&gt; Connotation is what is implied by the image.

==Coded iconic==

According to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"/&gt; The "reader" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics|year=2003|publisher=AKA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-035-2|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncoded iconic==

Noncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the "literal" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiler|first=Robert M.|title=Roland Barthes|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/barthes.htm|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.

'''Social choice theory''' or '''social choice'''  is a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for analysis of combining individual opinions, preferences, interests, or welfares to reach a ''collective decision'' or ''social welfare'' in some sense.&lt;ref name="Sen2008"&gt;[[Amartya Sen]], 2008. "social choice,". ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000164&amp;q=Social%20choice&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract &amp; TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A non-theoretical example of a collective decision is enacting a law or set of laws under a [[constitution]]. Social choice theory dates from [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]]'s formulation of the [[voting paradox]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' (1951) and [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] in it are generally acknowledged as the basis of the modern social choice theory.&lt;ref name="Sen2008"/&gt; In addition to [[Arrow's theorem]] and the [[voting paradox]], the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]], the [[Condorcet jury theorem]], the [[median voter theorem]], and [[May's theorem]] are among the more well known results from social choice theory.

Social choice blends elements of [[welfare economics]] and voting theory. It is [[Methodological individualism|methodologically individualistic]], in that it aggregates preferences and behaviors of individual members of society.  Using elements of [[formal logic]] for generality, analysis  proceeds from a set of seemingly reasonable [[axiom]]s of social choice to form a ''[[social welfare function]]'' (or [[Social welfare function#Arrow social welfare function (constitution)|''constitution'']]).&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Kenneth J. Arrow, 1951, ''Social Choice and Individual Values'', ch. [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m12-2/m12-2-02.pdf II], section 2, A Notation for Preferences and Choice, and ch. [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m12-2/m12-2-03.pdf III], "The Social Welfare Function".&lt;/ref&gt; Results uncovered the logical incompatibility of various axioms, as in Arrow's theorem, revealing an [[aggregation problem]] and suggesting reformulation or theoretical [[triage]] in dropping some axiom(s).&lt;ref name="Sen2008"/&gt;

Social choice and [[public choice]] theory may overlap but are disjoint if narrowly construed.  The [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]] place Social Choice  under [[Microeconomics]] at [[JEL classification codes#Microeconomics JEL: D Subcategories|JEL D71]]   (with Clubs, Committees, and Associations) whereas most [[Public choice|Public Choice]] subcategories are in JEL D72 (Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).

==Interpersonal utility comparison==

Social choice theory depends upon the ability to aggregate, or sum up, individual preferences into a combined  social welfare function. Individual preference can be modeled in terms of an economic [[utility function]]. The ability to sum utility functions of different individuals depends on the utility functions being comparable to each other; informally, individuals' preferences must be measured with the same yardstick. Then the ability to create a social welfare function depends crucially on the ability to compare utility functions. This is called ''interpersonal utility comparison''.

Following [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[utilitarianism|utilitarians]] have argued that preferences and utility functions of individuals are interpersonally comparable and may therefore be added together to arrive at a measure of aggregate utility.  Utilitarian ethics call for maximizing this aggregate.

[[Lionel Robbins]] questioned whether mental states, and the utilities they reflect, can be measured and, ''a fortiori'', interpersonal ''comparisons'' of [[utility]] as well as the social choice theory on which it is based.  Consider for instance the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]], according to which utility of an added quantity of a good decreases with the amount of the good that is already in possession of the individual.  It has been used to defend transfers of wealth from the "rich" to the "poor" on the premise that the former do not derive as much utility as the latter from an extra unit of income. Robbins ([[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|1935]], pp.&amp;nbsp;138–40) argues that this notion is beyond [[positive science]]; that is, one cannot measure changes in the utility of someone else, nor is it required by positive theory.

Apologists of the interpersonal comparison of utility have argued that Robbins claimed too much. [[John Harsanyi]] agrees that full comparability of mental states such as utility is never possible but believes, however, that human beings are able to make some interpersonal comparisons of utility because they share some common backgrounds, cultural experiences, etc.  In the example from [[Amartya Sen]] (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;99), it should be possible to say that [[Emperor Nero]]'s gain from burning Rome was outweighed by the loss incurred by the rest of the Romans. Harsanyi and Sen thus argue that at least partial comparability of utility is possible, and social choice theory proceeds under that assumption.

Sen proposes, however, that comparability  of interpersonal utility need not be partial.  Under Sen's theory of informational broadening, even complete interpersonal comparison of utility would lead to socially suboptimal choices because mental states are malleable. A starving peasant may have a particularly sunny disposition and thereby derive high utility from a small income. This fact should not nullify, however, his claim to compensation or equality in the realm of social choice.

Social decisions should accordingly be based on immalleable factors. Sen proposes interpersonal utility comparisons based on a wide range of data. His theory is concerned with access to advantage, viewed as an individual's access to goods that satisfy basic needs (e.g., food), freedoms (in the [[labor market]], for instance), and [[capability approach|capabilities]]. We can proceed to make social choices based on real variables, and thereby address actual position, and access to advantage. Sen's method of informational broadening allows social choice theory to escape the objections of Robbins, which looked as though they would permanently harm social choice theory.

Additionally, since the seminal results of Arrow's impossibility theorem and the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]], many positive results focusing on the restriction of the domain of preferences of individuals have elucidated such topics as optimal voting. The initial results emphasized the impossibility of satisfactorily providing a social choice function free of [[dictatorship]] and inefficiency in the most general settings.  Later results have found natural restrictions that can accommodate many desirable properties.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Background==
Increasing [[urbanization]] has caused problems with increased [[flash flooding]] after sudden rain. As areas of vegetation are replaced by concrete, [[asphalt]], or roofed structures, leading to [[impervious surface]]s, the area loses its ability to absorb rainwater. This rain is instead directed into surface water drainage systems, often overloading them and causing floods.

The idea behind SuDS is to try to replicate the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low [[environmental impact]] to drain away dirty and [[surface water]] run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, [[pollution]] of the environment – with the resultant harm to wildlife – and [[groundwater contamination|contamination]] of [[groundwater]] sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), [[rain garden]]s (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), [[Swale (landform)|swales]] (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other [[wetland]] habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.

Originally the term SUDS described the UK approach to sustainable urban drainage systems. These developments may not necessarily be in "urban" areas, and thus the "urban" part of SuDS is now usually dropped to reduce confusion. Other countries have similar approaches in place using a different terminology such as '''[[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]]''' (BMP) and '''[[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]]''' in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2006). [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=124 "Fact Sheet: Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies."] 2006-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[water-sensitive urban design]] in Australia .

SuDS use the following techniques:
* source control
* [[permeable paving]] such as [[pervious concrete]]
* storm water [[detention basin|detention]]
* storm water [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]
* [[transpiration|evapo-transpiration]] (e.g. from a [[green roof]])

A common misconception of SuDS is that they reduce flooding on the development site. In fact the SuDS is designed to reduce the impact that the surface water drainage system of one site has on other sites.  For instance, sewer flooding is a problem in many places. Paving or building over land can result in flash flooding. This happens when flows entering a sewer exceed its capacity and it overflows. The SuDS system aims to minimise or eliminate discharges from the site, thus reducing the impact, the idea being that if all development sites incorporated SuDS then urban sewer flooding would be less of a problem. Unlike traditional urban [[stormwater]] drainage systems, SuDS can also help to protect and enhance ground water quality.

==History==
The first sustainable drainage system to utilise a full management train including source control in the UK was [[Oxford services]] designed by Robert Bray Associates, specialist SuDS consultants.&lt;ref&gt;CIRIA [http://www.susdrain.org/case-studies/case_studies/welcome_break_wheatley.html Oxford Motorway Services Case Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tong2ji1.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese characters]] for ''tongji'']]
'''Tongji''' ({{zh|c=童乩|p=''tóngjī''|w=''t'ung-chi''|l=youth diviner}}; [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tâi-lô]]: tâng-ki) or '''Jitong''' ({{zh|c=乩童|p=''jītóng''|w=''chi-t'ung''|l=divining youth}}) is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese folk]] religious specialist, usually translated as a "[[spirit medium]]", "[[oracle]]", or "[[shaman]]".

This word compounds ''tong'' [[Wikt:童|童]] "child; youth; boy servant" and ''ji'' [[Wikt:乩|乩]] "to divine" (cf. ''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' 扶乩 "divination; planchette writing"). Regional variants include [[Hokkien]] ''tâng-ki'' 童乩 and [[Canton dialect|Cantonese]] ''gei-tung'' 乩童 or ''san-daa'' 神打.  

A ''tongji'' or ''jitong'' is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 "god; spirit" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]''  巫 "shaman; healer; spirit medium" who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a ''tongji'' who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world.

Frequently a person who will become a ''tongji'' to experiences a feeling of compulsion of something that will possess them. The person may attempt to resist that compulsion, but should their resistance fail, they will enter into a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] in which they  may beat themselves with a nail-studded ball at the end of a cord and handle to the point that he draws blood from multiple wounds on his back. While in this trance state the ''tongji'' is believed to be possessed by a ''shen''.

{{Translation sidebar}}
The '''translation of "law" to other European languages''' faces several difficulties. In most [[Europe]]an [[language]]s, as well as some others influenced by European languages, there are two different words that can be translated to [[English language|English]] as "[[law]]". For the general comparison in this article the [[Latin]] terms "ius" and "lex" will be used. Etymologically, ''[[ius]]'' has some relation to ''[[right]]'', ''[[justice|just]]'' or ''straight''.

==General==
There are in English two more or less synonymous [[adjective]]s, both from Latin origin, that correspond [[etymology|etymologically]] to the Continental distinction: the common word ''legal'' and the less common ''juridical'' (or even ''juristic''). However, the words ''ius'' and ''lex'' are not synonyms.

''Lex'' can sometimes be translated as ''[[legislation]]'', ''[[statute]]'', ''[[statutory law]]'' or even ''[[Act of Parliament|act]]'', even if the corresponding ''legislatio'', ''statutus'' and ''actus'' also exist. ''Lex'' is law made by a [[politics|political]] [[authority]], such as the [[Parliament]] or the [[Government]]. In modern societies, ''leges'' are usually written, though this is not a necessary feature. ''Lex'' is often used in the [[plural]] (''leges''), since each act is one ''lex''.

On the other hand, ''[[ius]]'' is also [[polysemy|polysemous]], since it can mean either ''law'' or ''right''. Continental legal scholars sometimes make a distinction between "subjective ''ius''" (any legal right) and "objective ''ius''" (the whole law), but this does not happen in ordinary language. The two senses of ''ius'' can be easily distinguished in most cases.

When ''ius'' means ''law'', it usually has some [[semantics|semantic]] connection to ''what is right'', ''[[justice|just]]'' or ''straight''. For instance, the [[Germany|German]] [[List of state mottos|motto]] ''Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit'' (literally ''Unity and law and freedom'')) has been translated as ''Unity and justice and freedom'', even though there is a different word for ''justice'' (''Gerechtigkeit''). ''Lex'' does not have such a connection. Some translators of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] works have translated ''Recht'' as ''objective right'' (see Steiner, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;276), although those works, especially Kant's, are just about law or, at most, about the best law.

Present day continental [[legal education|law schools]] and [[Faculty (university)|faculties]] claim to study ''ius''. [[Middle Ages|Mediaeval]] universities, on the contrary, usually had a faculty of ''leges''. [[English Wikipedia]]'s article on "[[law]]" [[Interwiki links|link]]s to other languages Wikipedias' articles on the equivalent to ''ius''.

There are a few European languages other than English where "law" translates into one word, such as [[Polish language|Polish]] ''prawo''. On the other side, a prominent non-European language which makes the distinction is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], where قانون (''qānūn'') is equivalent to ''lex'' and ﺣـق (''ḥaqq'') is equivalent to ''ius''.

To clarify the difference one may look at how these phrases translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

{| class="wikitable"
| width="250"| civil law = ''derecho civil'' || width="250"| forbidden by law = ''prohibido por la ley''
|-
| common law = ''derecho común'' || act of Congress = ''ley del Congreso''
|-
| immigration law = ''derecho de inmigración'' || Immigration Act = ''ley de inmigración''
|-
| natural law = ''derecho natural'' || laws of nature = ''leyes de la naturaleza''
|}

In bilingual and multilingual jurisdictions, a careful translation is needed in legal contexts to avoid ambiguity.  Even excellent translation cannot capture all the connotations of the original words, however, and many scholars argue for bilingual judges who can parse both versions of the text.

In Canada since 1891 the "[[equal authenticity rule]]" has held that the French and English versions of all federal laws are considered equally authoritative.  Nevertheless, the English and French texts of important may not translate exactly, which leaves open the possibility that justices may understand the same law to mean two different things.  This includes the problem of "law" versus "''droit''". For example, [[Osgoode Hall]] scholar Robert Leckey argues that in the 2006 [[Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys|Multani case]] over the banning of [[kirpans]] (Sikh ceremonial daggers) by a school board in Quebec, the justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], despite all writing their reasons in French, disagreed over the meaning of the phrase "''ne peuvent être restreints que par une règle de droit''" in Section 1 of the ''[[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which appears in the English version of the text as "not prescribed by law".  Relying on different cultural and academic backgrounds (Quebec's civil law and francophone administrative culture, versus the English common law and British traditions elsewhere in Canada) they either decided that the action of school board in banning the kirpan was, or was not, "''une règle de droit''" or "law" (without reference to the word "prescribed").  Lackey asserts that "[i]n administrative law from France, and in administrative law scholarship written in French in Quebec, a regulation is 'une règle de droit' and a decision is not 'une règle de droit'" whereas in English-language scholarship the difference between "prescribed by law" and not "prescribed by law" has nothing to do with a distinction between general norms and individual decisions.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol45/iss3/4 Leckey, Robert. "Prescribed by Law/Une Règle de Droit." Osgoode Hall Law Journal 45.3 (2007) : 571-620]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1235&amp;context=ohlj&lt;/ref&gt;

This difference between English and other European languages is sometimes invoked in the debates between [[legal positivism]], [[natural law]] and [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]]. Berkowitz (2005) argues that the rise of legal positivism corresponds to a "transformation of the sense of 'law', a difficult topic made more so by a particular limitation of the English language", the non-distinction between ''ius'' and ''lex''. [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] himself, in ''The concept of law'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;206 ff.), argued that the distinction between ''ius'' and ''lex'' might clarify the relation between law and [[morality]]. A similar point is made by Gardner (2004) in order to distinguish between "law" in general and "legal law".

For the sake of examples, this article uses the Latin words.

==The discussion on the relation between ''ius'' (''jus'') and ''lex''==

Continental [[legal positivism|legal positivists]] of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century claimed that all ''ius'' is ''lex''.

In German "Law Schools" sometimes the following allegory is told: The word "Recht" is closely related to the word "Rache" (which is "revenge" in English language). It brings in the idea of "an eye for an eye" as first instrument to overcome uncontrolled revenge. From this point of view, Recht is institutionalized Rache. But this means: If someone says: "I had 'the right' to do this.", he should say: "I did it out of revenge.", as the person is not a "legal" institution...

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legal education in the United States}}
'''Trial practice''' is an upper level course offered in most American [[law school]]s designed to teach future [[litigation|litigators]] the fine points of presenting a case to a [[judge]] and [[jury]]. Unlike most law school courses, a trial practice class has very little discussion of [[substantive law]], and is focused on the practical application of [[public speaking]], [[narrative]], and using [[body language]] to communicate a particular set of events to the triers of fact. Trial practice also contains elements of [[strategy]], teaching students how to decide the order in which witnesses should testify, when exhibits should be introduced, and how to trap opposing witnesses into giving testimony that damages their side.

[[evidence (law)|Evidence]] is the area of substantive law most reinforced by a trial practice course, with students learning how to apply evidence law in a real-life setting, including learning when they can object to questions asked of witnesses, what objections to raise, and how to effectively present objections.

Trial practice courses may have a classroom component.  Also, trial practice courses will usually have an ongoing "lab" component where an attorney will instruct a small group of students on trial skills and assist them in honing their craft. Often, students practice against one another in [[mock trial]]s throughout the course; for example, students may be divided into groups of 4, with each group containing two teams who practice against one another in mock trials. 

Rather than a [[final exam]], the course may culminate in a mock trial with volunteer "witnesses".

The [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators]]{{R|yagerOWA}} are used to aggregate the crisp values in decision making schemes (such as multi-criteria decision making, multi-expert decision making and  multi-criteria/multi-expert decision making).{{R|Yager|YagerBeliakov}} It is widely accepted that [[Fuzzy set]]s{{R|Zadeh}} are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making.

The type-1 OWA operators{{R|fssT1OWA|kdeT1OWA}} have been proposed for this purpose. The type-1 OWA operators provides a technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and [[data mining]], where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The two definitions for type-1 OWA operators are based on Zadeh's Extension Principle and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets. The two definitions lead to equivalent results.

==Definitions==

===Definition 1===
Let &lt;math&gt;F(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is defined as follows:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, a type-1 OWA operator is a mapping, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi \colon F(X)\times \cdots \times F(X)  \longrightarrow  F(X)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A^1 , \cdots ,A^n)  \mapsto   Y&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{Y} (y) =\displaystyle \sup_{\displaystyle \sum_{k =1}^n \bar {w}_i a_{\sigma (i)}  = y }\left({\begin{array}{*{1}l}\mu _{W^1 } (w_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu_{W^n } (w_n )\wedge \mu _{A^1 } (a_1 )\wedge \cdots \wedge \mu _{A^n } (a_n )\end{array}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar {w}_i = \frac{w_i }{\sum_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }&lt;/math&gt;,and &lt;math&gt;\sigma \colon \{1, \cdots ,n\} \longrightarrow \{1, \cdots ,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \geq a_{\sigma (i + 1)},\ \forall i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma(i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th highest element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 2===
Using the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

Given the n linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \cdots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \cdots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \cdots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Representation theorem of Type-1 OWA operators==

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, and the fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A^1, \cdots ,A^n&lt;/math&gt;, then we have that{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
:&lt;math&gt;Y=G&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregation result obtained by Definition 1, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the result obtained by in Definition 2.

==Programming problems for Type-1 OWA operators==

According to the Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators, a general type-1 OWA operator can be decomposed into a series of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators. In practice, this series of  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operators is used to construct the resulting aggregation fuzzy set. So we only need to compute the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the resulting aggregation fuzzy set is constructed with the membership function as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname{ \bigvee} \limits_{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \operatorname {\min }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \operatorname {\max }\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.{{R|kdeT1OWA}}

==Alpha-level approach to Type-1 OWA operation==

Three-step process:{{R|kdeT1OWA}}
* Step 1&amp;mdash;To set up the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;- level resolution in [0, 1].
* Step 2&amp;mdash;For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;,
:*Step 2.1&amp;mdash;To calculate &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha + }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.1-3.
# &lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to Step 2.1-2.

:*Step 2.2 To calculate&lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } &lt;/math&gt;
# Let &lt;math&gt;i_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;
# If &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } \ge A_{\alpha - }^{\sigma (i_0 )} &lt;/math&gt;, stop, &lt;math&gt;\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0 } &lt;/math&gt; is the solution; otherwise go to Step 2.2-3.
#&lt;math&gt;i_0 \leftarrow i_0 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, go to step Step 2.2-2.

* Step 3&amp;mdash;To construct the aggregation resulting fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; based on all the available intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \operatorname \bigvee \limits_{\alpha :x \in \left[ {\rho _{\alpha -} ^{i_0^\ast } ,\;\rho _{\alpha +} ^{i_0^\ast } } \right]} \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==
* Any OWA operators, like maximum, minimum, mean operators;&lt;ref name="yagerOWA" /&gt;
* Join operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT}} i.e., fuzzy maximum operators;
* Meet operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets,{{R|MT|zadehJ}} i.e., fuzzy minimum operators;
* Join-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets;{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}
* Meet-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets.{{R|kdeT1OWA|bookT1OWA}}

==Generalizations==
Type-2 OWA operators{{R|Zhou}} have been suggested to aggregate the [[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|type-2 fuzzy sets]] for soft decision making.

'''Urolagnia''' (also '''urophilia''', '''undinism''', '''golden shower''' and '''watersports''') is a form of [[salirophilia]] (which is a form of [[paraphilia]]) in which sexual excitement is associated with the sight or thought of urine or [[urination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/eight/000113596.htm|title=MerckEngage® - Healthy Living Tips and Health Information|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824034045/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Feight%2F000113596.htm|archive-date=24 August 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has origins in the [[Greek language]] (from ''ouron'' – urine, and ''lagneia'' – lust).&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-urolagnia.html |title=A Dictionary of Psychology |last=Colman |first=Andrew M. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-280632-1 |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321150936/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-urolagnia.html |archivedate=March 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SexDev-googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment |last=Laws |first=Dr. Richard |author2=William T.

==Overview==

As a [[paraphilia]], urine may be consumed or the person may bathe in it. Other variations include arousal from wetting or seeing someone else urinate in their pants or underclothes, or [[bedwetting|wetting the bed]]. Other forms of urolagnia may involve a tendency to be [[sexually aroused]] by smelling urine-soaked clothing or body parts. In many cases, a strong correlation or conditioning arises between urine smell or sight, and the sexual act. For some individuals the phenomenon may include a [[diaper]] fetish and/or arousal from [[Paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]].

Urolagnia is sometimes associated with, or confused with, arousal from having a full [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or a sexual attraction to someone else experiencing the discomfort or pain of a full bladder, possibly a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] inclination.

==Common variations==
* '''Clothes wetting''': The person is sexually aroused by wetting one's clothing or observing another person doing so. Usually that person prefers to stage the wetting so that his/her legs (or other body parts) become soaked with urine. The warm sensation felt when urine trickles on the body seems to give very relaxing and pleasurable feelings to the person. In many cases, that person is also aroused by smelling body parts that have a urine scent. Others get aroused by telling some people about when they lost control and wet themselves. Some prefer a particular type of clothing to urinate.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* '''[[Exhibitionism]]''': Becoming noticeably desperate or wetting oneself with the express purpose of being seen by strangers. Practitioners have described going to public places such as a mall or a park. Some intend to create situations where others can see their wet clothing.
* '''Human urinal''': Within the [[BDSM]] community, some individuals desire to be used as a human urinal and some desire to use a human urinal.  The submissive  is usually strictly forbidden from placing their lips directly on the body of the dominant so the practice routinely involves them receiving much of the spray all over their face, hair and body; however, another way of doing this that applies mostly to male dominants, is to place the mouth on the head of the penis and [[Urophagia|drink the urine]] as it is released. One other, less common variation of this kink involves the dominant partner urinating inside the submissive partner's vagina or anus, which is usually followed up by the submissive partner ejecting the urine from their orifice(s).
* '''[[Omorashi]]''': The act of holding one's own urine until the need to urinate is urgent, making another hold in their urine, or watching another person with an urgent need to urinate. This fetish sometimes originates from childhood memories of needing, or of seeing another needing, to urinate. Arousal may be triggered by seeing the body movements or facial expressions of that person. It can also be heightened by the person saying that they have to urinate. The arousal from being desperate comes from the sensation of having a full bladder.
* '''Pussing''': British expression for an activity involving a consenting couple where the male partner watches the woman urinate otherwise undetected in a semi-public place, usually a toilet cubicle at a pub, hotel, restaurant, theatre/cinema, office, club, etc. The  strategies and tactics that are used to smuggle one of the couple into and out of the toilet undetected are as important or almost as important as the urination. The activity is done by itself or as a part of or prelude to other activities which many times involve sex.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''[[Voyeurism]]''': Seeing another urinate without the person's knowledge either through video taping by a hidden camera, or by lurking in locations where people are urinating or are likely to have an urge to urinate.

==Frequency==
Jennifer Eve Rehor of [[San Francisco State University]] points out that such data as exists on what she calls "unconventional" or "kink" sexual behavior is generally problematic because of the way that it has been collected, through criminal and clinical case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Eve Rehor (2015), "Sensual, Erotic, and Sexual Behaviors of Women from the ‘'Kink’ Community," Archives of Sexual Behavior 44:825–836, DOI 10.1007/s10508-015-0524-2&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior that appears neither in criminal trials nor in clinical studies (for example, because the individuals concerned do not commonly seek professional help) is therefore under-reported. Rehor therefore surveyed 1,764 female participants in "kink" behavior (mostly association with [[BDSM]]) in 2010-11, receiving 1,580 valid responses. What Rehor calls "urine play" is relatively infrequent, with only 36.52% of her sample reporting having done it or having had it done to them. In contrast, 93.99% of her sample reported having done [[spanking]] or having had it done to them, and  61.96% reported having used or been exposed to [[feathers]]/[[fur]].&lt;ref&gt;Rehor (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to extrapolate Rehor's data onto the general population, but her study does give a guide to prevalence in the North American BDSM community.

'''Vincenzo Mirabella Alagona''' ([[Syracuse, Sicily]] 1570 - [[Modica]], 1624) was an Italian historian, archaeologist and architect, best known for his work ''Plans of Ancient Syracuse''.

== Family life==
Vincenzo Mirabella, son of Michele Mirabella and Giovanna Alagona,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; was born into a patrician family of French origin which had moved to Sicily in the early fourteenth century. As a young man he dedicated himself to the study of Greek, Latin and Italian literature as well as mathematics, music, history and poetry. He played an active part in civic life, holding office as ''magister nundinarum'' (Master of the Assizes) in 1593, Treasurer of the University in 1613-14 and Jurat, the highest office in the city, in 1616-17.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inc-cin.org/assets/pdf/articles/numismates-mirabella.pdf accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lucrezia Platamone, daughter of Antonio and Giovanna Zumbo, who brought him a substantial dowry and further connections to the leading families of Syracuse. He does not appear to have had any children with her.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in a house in Syracuse in front of the [[Church of St. Thomas in the Pantheon]], in a street which bears his name today.

==Architecture and building==
On a number of occasions he contributed to the development of Syracuse: in 1608 he was involved in the expansion of the cathedral square as representative of the church attorneys; he planned the [[Theatine]] Church of San Andrea built in 1610;{{efn|group=note|[http://www.antoniorandazzo.it/chiese%20demolite/sant-andrea-teatini.html San Andrea dei Teatini]}} in 1620 he provided technical advice to the Senate of Syracuse about the construction of a stone bridge over the [[Anapo]] to connect the city with Modica. From the early 1620s he moved to Modica to direct the building works for [[Santa Maria delle Grazie]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inc-cin.org/assets/pdf/articles/numismates-mirabella.pdf accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|group=note|[http://www.santuariomadonnadellegrazie.net/ Website of the Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie]}} Of his work on this building, only the western doorway remains, decorated with a fragmentary [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] supported by two columns mounted on high pedestals and crowned with a decorated arch with an intricate design.

==Literary and historical works==
He published his first book, a collection of [[madrigal]]s, in 1604. In recognition of his earlier works he was enrolled in the [[Accademia degli Oziosi]] in [[Naples]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1614 he became the first Sicilian to become a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siracusaweb.com/main/siracusa/personaggi/vincenzo-mirabella.html accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; (his membership was proposed by [[Giambattista della Porta]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006436&amp;searchAssoc=Assoc accessed 11/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; where he met [[Galileo Galilei]], with whom he corresponded.{{efn|group=note|[http://colombo.imss.fi.it/IMSS/?q=author:%22Mirabella%2C%20Vincenzo%2C%201570-1624.%22 ] | Letter from Vincenzo Mirabella to Galileo Galilei (7 July 1614) }}{{efn|group=note|[http://colombo.imss.fi.it/IMSS/?q=author:%22Mirabella%2C%20Vincenzo%2C%201570-1624.%22 ] | Letter from Vincenzo Mirabella to Galileo Galilei (19 August 1614) }} Passionate about the country's history and archaeology, he wrote a ''History of Syracuse'', but did not manage to have it published, and the manuscript was eventually lost.

[[File: Michelangelo Caravaggio 010.jpg|thumb|right|Caravaggio's 'Burial of St. Lucy']]
From October to December 1608 he accompanied the painter [[Caravaggio]] on visits to the archaeological remains of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].  On a trip with him to a disused quarry, Caravaggio coined the name '[[Ear of Dionysius]]' for it and later used it as a setting for his famous work the '[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St.Lucy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Warwick (ed.), Caravaggio: Realism, Rebellion, Reception, University of Delaware Press, 2006 p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casa di Vincenzo Mirabella 1.jpg|thumb|The interior of Mirabella's house]]
Vincenzo Mirabella assembled the objects he excavated into a diverse archaeological collection, which he exhibited in the rooms of his palace in Ortygia, at the current Via Mirabella nº23, which he steadily transformed into his own museum. At his death, his heirs donated parts of this collection to the Museu Patrio of Syracuse, which later became the [[Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi]].

==Description of the Plan of Ancient Syracuse==
His most important work, and the only one still extant today, was published in Naples in 1613 in Naples  - '' 'La dichiarazione della pianta delle antiche Siracuse e di alcune scelte medaglie di esse e dei principi che quelle possedettero' '' ''('Description of the plan of ancient Syracuse and of selected medals of that place and of the characteristics they possessed')''.{{efn|group=note|[https://archive.org/details/dichiarazionidel00mira Digital edition of 'La dichiarazione della pianta delle antiche Siracuse']}} The work was dedicated to [[Philip III of Spain]], who ruled Sicily at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ragusanews.com/articolo/48165/moriva-a-modica-390-anni-fa-vincenzo-mirabella-nobiluomo-siciliano accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The text was accompanied by a topographic plan of Syracuse, divided into nine panels,{{efn|group=note|[http://www.antoniorandazzo.it/siracusani/mirabella-due.html maps and illustrations from 'Description of the plan of ancient Syracuse']}} which bore a detailed hypothetical description of the city from [[Ortygia]] to the [[Euryalus fortress]], and from the source of the river [[Ciane]] to the house of [[Archimedes]], with a gazetteer of places of historical and archaeological interest. It was supplemented with biographies of Archimedes, [[Theocritus]], [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and [[Tisias]].  This work was the fruit of his studies of classical authors - [[Thucydides]], [[Plutarch]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Cicero]], [[Livy]], [[Strabo]] and [[Pomponius Mela]], as well as of the archaeological endeavours he undertook at his own expense. He was also the first to excavate the [[catacombs]] of Syracuse, which he illustrated in a panel of his book.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-mirabella_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ accessed 12/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The first (1613) edition of ''Pianta delle antiche Siracuse'' was quickly sold out. It was reprinted in [[Palermo]] in 1717 with the title ''Descrizione delle quattro città dell'Antica Siracusa'', edited by Giovan Battista Aiccardo. Another edition of the map, recently rediscovered, is in the ''Thesaurus Antiquitatum et Historiarum Siciliae'' of Giovanni Giorgio Graevio, edited by Vander Aa in 1725 in ''Lugduni Batavorum'' ([[Leiden]]).

{{Citazione|''“D.O.M. - D. Vincentius Mirabella et Alagona, patritius syracusanus, studio vetustatis, liberalium artium peritia ac splendore virtutum vir insignis, ubique clarissimus, et inter Linceos honorifice cooptatus, qui antiquam Patriae glorian e tenebris erutam ac luci restitutam, cum sui nominis laude posteritati fecit immortalem. Motycae decedens post Deiparae Virginis festum, cujus ergo advenerat, in eius templo, cura sua praecipue olim extructo, mortalitatis exuvias deposuit. Anno Domini 1624, aetatis suae 54.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ragusanews.com/articolo/48165/moriva-a-modica-390-anni-fa-vincenzo-mirabella-nobiluomo-siciliano accessed 12/7/2018&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Citazione|''Don Vincenzo Mirabella e Alagona, patrician of Syracuse, student of antiquity, expert in the liberal arts, man of signal virtues and splendour, most renowned in every place, Linceian Academician, who restored from darkness to light the ancient glory of his homeland, rendering it immortal. The city of Modica lays to rest his mortal remains in the temple, built under his principal care, of the Virgin whom he venerated and after whose Feast of the Separation (i.e. the second Sunday of Easter) he died.Year of our Lord 1624, at the age of 54.''}}

[[File:Meisje van Yde, Drents Museum, N1897 VI1.jpg|thumb|Head and trunk of Yde Girl]]
[[Image:Yde_bog_girl.jpg|thumb|Location where the Yde Girl was found]]

'''Yde Girl''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|d|ə|audio=Yde IPA.ogg}}) is a [[bog body]] found in the ''Stijfveen'' [[peat]] bog near the village of [[Yde]], [[Netherlands]]. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her [[hair]]), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a [[fortnight]] later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated.&lt;ref name=deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James M.|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|title=Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands: The Yde Girl|accessdate=16 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152742/http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt; The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

==Examination==
[[Image:DrentseBody.jpg|thumb|left|The Yde Girl's body]]

[[Carbon-14]] tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of [[Windeby I]], however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from [[scoliosis]]. She stood at {{convert|137|cm|ftin}}, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as [[sprang]], wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper|title=BEST MUSEUM EXHIBIT: THE MYSTERIOUS BOG PEOPLE|date=7 December 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite news|last=Nephin|first=Dan|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=AP Online|title=Mummy Exhibit Shows Off Interactive Side|date=6 July 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the [[Kayhausen Boy]], who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the [[tannic acid]] in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.

The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. [[Richard Neave]], of University of Manchester, took a [[CT scan]] of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohd Isa|first=Marisa|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82747279.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=News Straits Times|title=Unveiling mummy secrets|date=6 January 2006}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from [[plastic surgery]] and criminal [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Prag | first1 = John | last2 = Neave | first2 = Richard | title = Making faces: using forensic and archaeological evidence |trans-title=Bodies from the Bog | year = 1997 | publisher = British Museum | location = London | language = | isbn = 0-7141-1743-9 | pages = 157–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]].

'''Yu Hao''' ({{zh|c=喻皓}}, {{fl.}} 970) was an eminent [[History of China|Chinese]] [[structural engineer]] and [[architect]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] period (960–1279).

==Legacy==
Yu Hao was given the title of Master-Carpenter (Du Liao Jiang) for his architectural skill.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 81"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the ''Mu Jing'' (木經; ''Timberwork Manual'') when he was active sometime between 965 to 995, considered an important piece of classical Chinese architectural literature, and although it no longer survives, [[Shen Kuo]] quoted from it.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 82"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 989, his architectural design and [[structural engineering]] work culminated in the construction of the Kai-Bao Pagoda, a wooden [[Chinese pagoda]] of medieval [[Kaifeng]] (the Northern Song's capital city).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagoda was lost in a 1040 lightning conflagration, while the now famous [[Iron Pagoda]] of Kaifeng was rebuilt on the same spot in 1049, constructed out of brick and stone to resist arson and lightning fires.

==Timberwork Manual==

Writing a century later (c. 1088), the [[polymath]] scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) praised the architectural writings of Yu Hao. Below are two passages from Shen's book ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' (''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''), outlining the basics contained in Yu's 10th century work on early Song-era architecture.

In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting [[strut]]s for diagonal wind bracing ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

{{cquote|When Mr. [[Qian Weiyan|Chhien (Wei-Yen)]] was Governor of the two [[Chekiang]] provinces, he authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-Thien Ssu ([[Brahma]]-Heaven Temple) in [[Hangchow]] with a design of twice three stories. While it was under construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a present of golden [[hairpin (fashion)|hair pin]]s, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the work, fixed with ([[iron]]) [[nail (fastener)|nails]], and it will not move any more.' The Master-Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) were mutually linked like the cage of the [[thorax]]. Although people might walk on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus shown.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"/&gt;}}

In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book (Wade-Giles spelling):

{{cquote|Methods of building construction are described in the ''Timberwork Manual'', which, some say, was written by Yu Hao. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion (fen), what is above the cross-beams follows the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8&amp;nbsp;ft.) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5&amp;nbsp;ft.) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) [[rafter]]s, etc. For example, a column (11&amp;nbsp;ft.) high will need a platform (4.5&amp;nbsp;ft.) high. So also for all the other components, [[corbel]]led brackets (kung), projecting rafters (tshui), other rafters (chueh), all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps (chun tao) are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps (man tao) are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones (phing tao) are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders (thu mu chih kung) in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself!&lt;ref name="Needham volume 4 82 84"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
