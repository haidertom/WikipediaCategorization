[[Image:Greatrift.jpg|thumb|right|The Arava is a long desert valley in a natural rift located between the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], a northern extension of the [[Red Sea]].]]
The '''Arava Institute for Environmental Studies''' is an academic studies and research institute located at [[Kibbutz]] [[Ketura (Kibbutz)|Ketura]] on the [[Israel]]i side of the [[Arabah|Arava]] Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/arava-institute-muslim-jewish-dialogue_n_7105274.html|title=In The Middle East, Muslims And Jews Work In Unison To Care For The Environment|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the motto that "nature knows no borders",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2009/04/cousteau-israel-water/|title=It's The Water That Binds Us, Alexandra Cousteau Finds|website=Green Prophet|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seeks to train future leaders of the [[Middle East]] in environmental issues so that they will be able to cooperate in [[Environmental peacebuilding|solving regional environmental problems.]] The [[Arabah|Arava]] is a sparsely populated desert valley that connects the [[Dead Sea]] region with the [[Red Sea]], and is part of the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. Between the Dead Sea and the cities of [[Eilat]] and [[Aqaba]], the Arava forms the border between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]]. 

Kibbutz Ketura, founded in 1973 by members of [[Young Judaea]], is located only a few hundred meters from the border between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]]. [[Ketura, Israel|Kibbutz Ketura]] is one of a small number of [[intentional communities]] in Israel, and that makes it an ideal setting for a culturally diverse program. Members of the Kibbutz are both religious and non-religious Jews who have chosen to live together in the same community and maintain an egalitarian synagogue. The kibbutz is also a member of Israel's Green Kibbutzim movement, which seeks to promote environmentally friendly and sustainable practices. A portion of the kibbutz's agricultural produce is organic.

== Students and academic programs ==
Students at the Arava Institute live on Kibbutz [[Ketura]] while taking classes in sustainable development, water management, environmental law, economic policy, environmental science, and other topics in environmental studies. Classes are taught in English. Members of the faculty are often guest lecturers from universities, both in Israel and abroad, or professionals in fields such as public policy and water management.

Students come from around the world to study and conduct research at the Arava Institute. Since its founding in 1996, the Arava Institute has hosted over 800 graduate and undergraduate students of various nationalities, including Israeli Jewish, [[Israeli Arab]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], [[Jordanian people|Jordanian]], [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]], [[Tunisian people|Tunisian]], [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]], European and American students. The Arava Institute has been able to maintain a diverse student body even during very difficult times elsewhere in Israel and the Middle East.

[[File:AIES-lecture-2018.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lecture on the ecology of coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba, 2018]]
Students can participate in semester and year-long programs accredited through Ben Gurion University as well as two master's degree graduate programs granted by [[Ben-Gurion University]] – one in Environmental Desert Studies and the other a “Green” MBA that teaches environmental sustainability and efficiency as well as business management skills. A three-week summer course is sometimes offered to study biodiversity and environmental challenges in the Arava Valley. The Arava Institute is considering establishing a joint Master’s program with [[Al-Quds University]], the only Arab institution of higher learning in Jerusalem. All students are required to completes a non-credit bearing Peace-Building and Environmental Leadership Seminar, which provides them with a facilitated forum for expressing their views on race, religion, identity, and the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISRAEL - ARAVA INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES (AIES)|url=http://www.oneonta.edu/undergradcatalog/israel---arava-institute-for-environmental-studies-aies.asp|publisher=SUNY Oneonta|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alumni ==
Many of the Arava Institute graduates are working in the environmental or peacebuilding field. The Institute has created an alumni network to continue supporting alumni by providing personal and professional contacts as well as seed money for alumni projects that demonstrate cross-cultural cooperation. Several alumni of the institute have gone on to work in cross-cultural projects.

*Hashem Shahin, a Muslim Palestinian alumnus, is part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian project to discover the genetic basis of deafness. 
*Tamar Keinan, a Jewish Israeli alumna, joined a Jordanian alumnus to create the "Good Neighbors Water Project" for Friends of the Earth Middle East. 
*Laithi Gnaim, an Israeli Arab alumnus, established a nongovernmental organization called "Arrasid" (Bearing Witness) which trains Arab farmers in the [[Beit Netofa Valley]] in sustainable farming techniques. He has used connections made at the Arava Institute to offer training in sustainable practices and bui Arab-Jewish partnerships in the agricultural sector.
*Maya Negev, a Jewish Israeli alumna, working at the Herzog Center for Policy in Tel Aviv University

Others are working in NGOs working on solutions to hygiene and energy in rural and poor areas, working on environmental education and awareness, activists in peace related activities and more.

The Arava Institute has recently added a new network to build more connections between alumni. Called AAPEN or the Arava Alumni Peace and Environmental Network, AAPEN brings together alumni from all years of study during an annual conference held in varying locations in the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/05/01/100-israeli-palestinian-and-jordanian-students-meet-in-war-for-the-environment/|title=100 Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian Students Meet in ‘War for the Environment’|website=Algemeiner.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an online presence on Facebook, a private online network (NING), updated pages on the Arava website for alumni, a newsletter, and more.

== Research centers ==
In addition to its academic programs, the Arava Institute conducts cross-border studies in four research centers:
 
* The '''Center for Hyper-Arid Socio-Ecology''' (CHASE), directed by Dr. Miri Lavi Neeman, is dedicated to the study of the natural ecosystems in the Arava valley and the interaction between those ecosystems and the region’s people. The center brings together Jordanian and Israeli researchers to map the biodiversity of the region, in order to better protect natural resources while enabling sustainable human development in the region. Projects include monitoring of the [[2014 Israeli oil spill|2014 Evrona Oil Spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.687747|title=Evrona Reserve's Ecology in Danger Due to Oil Spill's Damage to Trees|last=Rinat|first=Zafrir|date=2015-11-23|newspaper=Haaretz|language=en|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation''' (CREEC), directed by Dr. Tareq abu Hamed, conducts research in a wide variety of subjects focusing on energy policy, solar fuels, photovoltaic technologies, biomass, wind and solar thermal energy, as well as innovative building construction techniques customized to conserve energy in desert climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Health/Science-Technology-and-Space-Ministry-names-Arab-chemical-engineer-its-deputy-chief-scientist-394868|title=Science, Technology and Space Ministry names Arab chemical engineer its deputy chief scientist|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Methuselah-Ketura-2018-10.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The "Methuselah" tree]]
* The '''Center for Sustainable Agriculture''' (CSA), directed by Dr. Elaine Solowey, is dedicated to the investigation and preservation of arid lands and their natural resources. Among the center's notable projects are the sprouting of a 2,000 year old date seed, nicknamed "[[Judean date palm|Methuselah]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/051122-old-plant-seed-food/|title=2,000-Year-Old Seed Sprouts, Sapling Is Thriving|date=2005-11-22|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the revival of the [[Boswellia sacra|frankincense tree]] in Israel 1,500 years after its last appearance in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/after-1500-years-frankincense-returns-to-the-holy-land/|title=After 1,500 years, frankincense returns to the Holy Land in time for Christmas|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''Center for Transboundary Water Management''' (CTWM), directed by Dr. Clive Lipchin, provides a platform for water professionals and policy makers from Israel, Palestine and Jordan to cooperate in water conservation, desalination, wastewater treatment and education. Its project include the installation of [[Greywater|greywater treatment]] systems in Israel and the [[West Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Magazine-Features/How-clear-is-our-water|title=How clear is our water?|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research on sinkholes and desalination in the [[Dead Sea]] basin.

In addition, the '''Arava Center for Sustainable Development''' (ACSD), under the supervision of Dr. Shmuel Brenner, aims to reduce poverty, enhance sustainability and empower communities by supporting locally driven, environmentally focused development programs worldwide. One of those programs is the agricultural development program "Furrows in the Desert" in [[Turkana County|Turkana]], Kenya, which intends to create greater food security to the region by building local capacity in sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=23206|title=Kenya: Building peace and greening the desert in Turkana|date=2013-09-12|website=Independent Catholic News|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Avalon Organic Gardens &amp; EcoVillage''' also known as Avalon Gardens, is a [[sustainable community]] and [[ecovillage]] started in 1994 by [[Global Community Communications Alliance]]. The ecovillage is located in [[Tumacacori, Arizona]], south of [[Tubac, Arizona]] in the Santa Cruz Valley and consists of over 100 residents. Its sustainable practices include [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing, [[organic gardening]], [[rainwater harvesting]], [[greywater]] recycling, [[alternative energy]] sources, [[eco-architecture]], [[resource management]], and [[Sustainability#Management of human consumption|human consumption management]].

==History and vision==
Avalon Gardens was started in 1994 in northern [[Arizona]], USA. In 2007 the ecovillage moved to the Potreros Ranch in Tumacacori, neighboring the [[Mission San José de Tumacácori]] (Tumacacori Mission), started by Father [[Eusebio Kino]] in 1691. The ecovillage incorporates some of the traditional agricultural practices employed by the Tumacacori ranchers and farmers in former decades as well as newer [[permaculture]] methods. They plan to extend their facilities and housing to accommodate visiting and resident [[WWOOF]]ers, students, and workshop participants.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Milinovich “New Neighbors”, The Villager June/July 2007, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and development==

===Organic gardening===
Avalon Gardens has a year-round organic food production system that involves [[greenhouse]]s, [[garden bed]]s and [[forest gardening]], [[drip irrigation]], soil composting and development, [[food preservation]], and [[seed saving]]. Avalon Gardens locally participates in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) program,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Vandervoet, “Avalon Organic Gardens, Farm, and Ranch Harvests Organic Produce Locally” Santa Cruz Valley Sun, August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; being the first established in the state of Arizona. Their “Hands In The Soil” mornings are organized for public participation in [[organic gardening]] at the ecovillage, and workshops and tours are held regularly for public education and training. The gardens also supplies vegetables to the Food For Ascension Café, an organic [[vegan]]-[[vegetarian]] and [[slow food]] movement restaurant in Tucson.

===Water harvesting===
Water harvesting is important to the ecovillage because they are located in desert climate. At the ecovillage, rainwater is collected from house rooftops and water-catchment tanks. Thousands of gallons of run-off rainwater are redirected and stored to water high-water use trees, their [[food forest]], gardens, and [[pasture]]s. Through a greywater system, water is harvested from washing machines, indoor and outdoor showers, and house sinks and basins. This water is used to water flower beds, trees, and plants around the homes.

Rainwater harvesting has become significant in view of the realization that water has become scarce and it is becoming a critical problem globally. In big cities large residencies are required to have a rainwater harvesting system. For the present, drains are being constructed with conventional materials such as brick and [[stonemasonry]] and R.C.C. side drains. Rain water is made to flow through these drains to a centralized water storage tank. Water from this tank is designated for nondomestic and gardening purposes. The water storage tank is of brick masonry or R.C.C. The drains for the flow of rainwater and the tank for the storage of rainwater can be constructed using [[Ferrocement]] technology. Ferrocement drains are machine-made, precast products about 2.4 to 5 meters long with covers and perforations of the same length at about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The surfaces of these drains are known to be strong and not easily eroded by the flow of water. The bottom and sides of the water storage tanks consist of ferrocement plates with space frames. These plates are about 25&amp;nbsp;mm thick, waterproof, strong, durable, and low-maintenance.

===Energy-efficient building===
The ecovillage uses sustainable, renewable, and recycled building materials in their building and construction projects. Paper and cardboard products are reused by blending them into a fiber pulp that is mixed with cement, poured into molds, and dried. This reused paper-cement mix is called [[papercrete]], and the blocks are used as building material for walls, benches, flower beds, and other types of structures. Some of the sustainable dwellings at Avalon Gardens include earth domes, [[monolithic domes]], yurts, and Eco-friendly houses.

===Sustainable transport &amp; sharing resources===
To reduce their [[ecological footprint]], noise and air pollution, ecovillage residents [[carpool]], group-transit, bike, walk, and use other means of [[sustainable transport]]. Assigned shoppers buy food and supplies in bulk, and designated shuttle drivers make daily pickups and deliveries for over 100 residents.

Ecovillage residents share resources like vehicles, washing machines, and household appliances to make the most and best use of them. One of their facilities is a community kitchen and dining room where most of the meals are prepared and served for the entire community. Bio-friendly cleaning products and personal care products are also used to avoid water and environmental contamination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5607">A '''biorefinery''' is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, heat, and value-added chemicals from [[biomass]]. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's [[petroleum refinery]], which produce multiple fuels and products from [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr W J Smith, Tamutech Consultancy. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/mapping-the-development-of-uk-biorefinery-complexes-nnfcc-07-008 Mapping the Development of UK Biorefinery Complexes], NNFCC, 2007-06-20. Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] Bioenergy Task 42 on Biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat).

By producing multiple products, a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock. Some researcher have considered the exploration of a biorefinery as a practical method of improving the economic performance of stand-alone biomass to bioenergy system since biochemicals are produced&lt;ref&gt;1.	Okoro, V.O., Sun, Z. and Birch, J. 2017. Meat processing waste as a potential feedstock for biochemicals and biofuels- A review of possible conversion technologies. Journal of Cleaner Production 142 .1583-1608&lt;/ref&gt; A biorefinery could, for example, produce one or several low-volume, but high-value, chemical or [[nutraceutical]] products and a low-value, but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as [[biodiesel]] or [[bioethanol]] (see also [[alcohol fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/the-biorefinery-opportunity-a-north-east-england-view-nnfcc-08-001 The Biorefinery Opportunity - A North East England view, NNFCC 08-001], NNFCC, 2008-06-28. Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time generating electricity and process heat, through [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) technology, for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility. The high-value products increase profitability, the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs, and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from traditional power plant facilities.  Although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries, the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized. Future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from [[petroleum]].

==Examples==
The fully operational [[Blue Marble Energy]] company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa, WA and Missoula, MT.

Canada's first Integrated Biorefinery, developed on anaerobic digestion technology by [[Himark BioGas]] is located in [[Hairy Hill, Alberta]]. The Biorefinery utilizes Source Separated Organics from the metro [[Edmonton]] region, Open Pen Feedlot Manure, and Food Processing Waste.

Several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed, starting from feedstocks such as [[tobacco]], [[flax]] [[straw]] and the residues from the production of [[bioethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Briens, Jan Piskorz and Franco Berruti, "Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review," 2008. International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering, 6, R2&lt;/ref&gt; Biorefineries have also been proposed to gather as much materials from trees (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose, lignine, lipids) as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.unu.edu/zef/publications-e/intro%20to%20biorefinery.pdf Janis Gravitis' biorefinery]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemrec|Chemrec's]] technology for [[black liquor]] [[gasification]] and production of [[second-generation biofuels]] such as [[biomethanol]] or Bio[[Dimethyl ether|DME]] is integrated with a host [[pulp mill]] and utilizes a major [[sulfate process|sulfate]] or [[sulfite process]] waste product as feedstock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p1204 Forest Encyclopedia Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">The '''Carolina Wilderness EMS Externship''' ('''CWEMSE''') is an out-of-hospital medical training for 4th year medical students and [[Residency (medicine)|resident physicians]] interested in furthering their educational interests in wilderness EMS.

==History==
The Externship was founded by emergency and EMS physician [[Seth C. Hawkins]] in 2011, and co-founded by the Pilot Extern of that year, Dr. Ben Abo. Hawkins remains the course director and the course operates as a project of Hawk Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tammie |first1=Gercken |title=Doctor presents wilderness EMS film series to educate public |url=https://www.morganton.com/community/doctor-presents-wilderness-ems-film-series-to-educate-public/article_cd7f6012-a709-11e8-ab96-078a63403bd0.html |website=The News Herald |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
During one month each year, Hawk Ventures invites two Externs to [[Burke County, North Carolina]] to participate in an unusual collaboration of local medical resources—a community EMS system (Burke County Emergency Services), a community hospital system ([[Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge-Morganton]]), a community college ([[Western Piedmont Community College]]), and an international research university ([[Wake Forest University]]‘s Department of Emergency Medicine). During this month the Externs operate as full members of the out-of-hospital medical team while learning the detailed workings of EMS medical direction, protocol management, and system response in the setting of rural, austere, and wilderness environments in Burke County. The county includes Linville Gorge Wilderness Area (the deepest gorge in the eastern United States, known as the “Grand Canyon of the East”), South Mountains State Park (the largest state park in North Carolina), and Lake James and its state park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilusz |first1=Ryan |title=Med school ‘externs’ reflect on wilderness EMS rotation |url=https://www.morganton.com/news/med-school-externs-reflect-on-wilderness-ems-rotation/article_f52251d4-b51e-11e7-a6f6-97f10dde4371.html |website=The News Herald |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An atypical feature of this training program is that the physician trainees learn from field paramedics, which reverses the typical EMS model of physicians teaching and supervising EMS personnel. The Externs also establish a research project on an innovative topic related to wilderness EMS, formulate a lecture based on this research that is geared toward ALS and BLS crews within the county, and provide the lecture as part of in-service for the month of the Externship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Hutchins| first=R | date= August 29, 2012| title=Into the Wild|url=http://www.morganton.com/news/into-the-wild/article_416c599a-bb1f-5d93-86be-12944e900453.html|website=The News Herald|location=Morganton, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has resulted in numerous contributions to the medical literature and medical education, including a description of the first case of interventional ultrasound use in a wilderness environment&lt;ref&gt;Kranc DA, Jones AW, Nackenson J, Davis C, Abo B, Hawkins SC. Use of Ultrasound for Joint Dislocation Reduction in an Austere Wilderness Setting: A Case Report. Prehospital Emergency Care, posted online 10 Oct 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and development of the innovative “Safety Third” principle in emergency management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety is Third, Not First, and We All Know It Should Be |url=https://www.jems.com/articles/2018/11/safety-is-third-not-first-and-we-all-know-it-should-be.html |website=Journal of Emergency Medical Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Externs respond to EMS and wilderness EMS calls throughout the month and learn scene management, medical command, and other duties that an EMS physician may be responsible for providing when engaged in a wilderness EMS setting. This program's hands-on, experiential learning style in the field rather than the classroom, and the program's emphasis on field providers training physicians rather than the reverse, has been identified as "[[esse quam videri]]" learning. This approach has been cited in the wilderness medicine literature as an optimal way to acquire wilderness EMS and [[Search &amp; Rescue]] (SAR) education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/1127/CWEMSE |title=Carolina Wilderness EMS Externship: Turning the World Into Your Classroom|author1=Amsalem D | author2=Circh R |date=2014|publisher=Wilderness Medical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Accolades==
In 2018 the Externship received the [[Society for Academic Emergency Medicine]]’s “Innovation in Medical Education Award”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Seth Hawkins, local EMS externship honored with national award |url=https://www.morganton.com/news/dr-seth-hawkins-local-ems-externship-honored-with-national-award/article_c4c8c20e-68ef-11e8-978f-97fa65e3718f.html |website=The News Herald |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carroll D. Osburn''', an American scholar recognized as one of North America’s leading [[biblical criticism|New Testament textual critics]] and a prominent [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]], is Carmichael-Walling Distinguished Professor Emeritus at [[Abilene Christian University]],&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Retires,” Abilene Christian University Press Release, September 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and former Executive Director, Caris Foundation. As an author, he has been collected primarily by libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n93081035/ |title=Osburn, Carroll D. |publisher=worldcat.org |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

Osburn graduated from [[Harding University]], where he was president of the senior class and received a BA in 1963, with majors in biology and Greek. He received the MTh in 1968 from [[Harding School of Theology]]. After graduating from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1970 with the DDiv [now DMin] degree, he received his PhD in New Testament and early Byzantine Greek from the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, in 1974.

== Academic career ==

From 1973-1983, Osburn served as Professor of Greek and New Testament at Harding School of Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Harding of Memphis ''Graduate School Bulletin'' 13.8 (Nov. 1974): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  To students primarily from Churches of Christ for whom the use of scripture was dogmatic proof-texting, Osburn emphasized literary and historical controls to biblical interpretation. Eugene Nida encouraged him to serve as translation consultant for Bible translators among pre-literate people. Utilizing discourse analysis, Osburn conducted numerous short-term, one book workshops for translators in Central and South America in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;“Carroll Osburn.” ''ACU Today'' (Spring, 1996): 13, “Bible Translation Among Pre-Literate People,” ''Image'' 7 (1991): 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also developed sensitivity to humanitarian needs in the Developing World. Adding discourse analysis to literary and historical method led to Greek classes formerly of five or six numbering fifty or sixty. He became a popular speaker at seminars and retreats in the U.S. and around the world. In 1980, he was Visiting Professor at the University of St. Andrews, and in 1983, was named “Educator of the Year” by ''20th Century Christian''.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Honored as Educator of the Year,” ''20th Century Christian'' 45.11 (August 1983): 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osburn became Distinguished Professor of New Testament at Pepperdine University 1983-1987.&lt;ref&gt;“Osburn Assumes Post.” ''The Christian Chronicle'' 40.7 (July 1983): 12, and ''Who’s Who in the World'', 1984-85.&lt;/ref&gt;   Urged by Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, and Bruce Metzger, he concentrated attention on ancient manuscripts underlying the Greek New Testament, and chaired the New Testament Textual Criticism Section of the Society of Biblical Literature 1984-90.

In 1987, Osburn was invited to Abilene Christian University, where he was Carmichel-Walling Distinguished Professor of New Testament Language and Literature until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;“First $1 Million Endowed Chair Established.” ''ACU Today'' 41.4 (Winter, 1990): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named “Honors Professor of the Year” in 1992 and 1996, and was Chair of the Faculty Senate in 1999-2000. He was on the Steering Committee of the International Greek New Testament Project on John (Birmingham, England) and co-editor of ''Acts of the Apostles'' in ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' (Institüt für neutestamentliche Textforschung; Münster, Germany) until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Tera Harmon, “Carroll D. Osburn,” in ''Transmission and Reception: New Testament Text-Critical and Exegetical Studies''. Texts and Studies, Third Series, Vol. 4. Ed. J. Childers and D. Parker. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2006: 286. Osburn also served as Beirat for the Hermann Kunst-Stiftung at Münster, 2003-2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Visiting Professor at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens in 1989, at Universität Münster in 2003, and at Claremont School of Theology in 2008. He did archaeological work with Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the Philistine city of Ekron [Tel Miqne] in 1993. In 2004, he published ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Osburn, ''The Text of the Apostolos in Epiphanius of Salamis''. NTGF 6. Leiden, The Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Osburn was invited frequently to lecture at universities in Europe, Canada, Africa, and South America. He was a member of Association Internationale d’Études Patristiques and continues membership in ''Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas''.&lt;ref&gt;''Firm Foundation'' 100:28 (12 July 1983): 21 [489].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to challenging fundamentalists to rethink polemical interpretation of biblical texts,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., “Interpreting Greek Syntax.” In ''Biblical Interpretation: Principles and Practices. Studies in Honor of Jack Pearl Lewis''. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1986: 234-243; and “Continuing in Sin–Matthew 19:9,” ACU Lectures. Ed. Carl Brecheen. Abilene, TX: ACU Bookstore, 1982: 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  Osburn also worked to expand boundaries of exclusiveness. He was a pioneer within his religious heritage, tackling difficult issues such as dogmatic sectarianism and gender inequality. In 1993, he published ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Peaceable Kingdom: Essays Favoring Non-Sectarian Christianity''. Abilene, TX: Restoration Perspectives, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001, ''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in the Church: Reclaiming the Ideal''. Abilene, TX: ACU Press, 2001. See “Prominent Christian Egalitarians,” in en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_egalitarianism. ''Essays on Women in Earliest Christianity''. Ed. Carroll Osburn. 2 Vols. Joplin, MO: College Press, 1993, 1995, is now published by Wipf and Stock.&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated and hosted the annual Carmichael-Walling Lectures at ACU, which brought renowned scholars from around the world to the campus for stimulating lectures and discussion beyond traditional thinking. His challenges to rethink crucial issues met forceful opposition, but with passing of time, were accepted by increasing numbers of moderates. A ''festschrift'' presented to him on his sixty-fifth birthday consists of essays by noted scholars from around the world, some his former students.&lt;ref&gt;Childers and Parker, ''Transmission and Reception'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4500">The '''Centre for Ships and Ocean Structures''' (CeSOS) is a research centre located at the Marine Technology Centre in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2006/no_1/maritimeresearchfindsnewapplications.asp Det Norske Veritas (19.06.2006): Maritime research finds new applications, 9-10]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research centre's goal is to create fundamental knowledge about the design and operation of [[ships]] and ocean structures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2006/no_1/maritimeresearchfindsnewapplications.asp Det Norske Veritas (19.06.2006): Maritime research finds new applications, 1-4]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre has been active since 2002, when it was established as a Centre of Excellence (CoE) by the [[Research Council of Norway]] and the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forskningsradet.no/servlet/Satellite?c=Prosjekt&amp;cid=1193731572719&amp;pagename=ForskningsradetNorsk/Hovedsidemal&amp;p=1181730334233 Norges Forskningsråd: Prosjektarkiv]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the financing period by the [[Research Council of Norway]] finished in 2012, research activities are still ongoing in 2013 and 2014, financed by external means.

== Research areas ==
Research at CeSOS focuses on the creation of fundamental knowledge about the design and operation of future ships and ocean structures, using analytical, numerical and [[experimental]] studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The centre has furthermore made it its responsibility to integrate [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[hydrodynamics]], [[structural mechanics]] and [[automatic control]] in its research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2006/no_1/maritimeresearchfindsnewapplications.asp Det Norske Veritas (19.06.2006): Maritime research finds new applications, 42-44]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge that is being produced by this kind of research is vital, both now and in the future, for the design of safe, cost effective and environmentally friendly structures as well as in the planning and execution of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntnu.no/aktuelt/skapende/oljegass/sentre NTNU (2011): Olje og gass, sentre, 3-5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908065631/http://www.ntnu.no/aktuelt/skapende/oljegass/sentre |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of such work cannot be over-emphasised: In tonnage terms, 95 per cent of all international transport is by sea, and 20 per cent of the world’s oil and gas is produced from [[subsea]] reservoirs via [[Oil platform|offshore structures]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesos.ntnu.no/ CeSOS, 5-8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, food production in aquacultural plants and the exploitation of [[renewable energy]] from the [[oceans]] is expected to play a growing role. The scientific and engineering research carried out in the centre takes account of such future needs, and extends current knowledge in relevant disciplines. The emphasis is on the [[synergy]] between [[hydrodynamics]], [[structural mechanics]] and [[automatic control]].

'''Climate Impacts Research Centre''' (CIRC) is a [[research institute]] based at the ''Department of ecology and environmental science'' (EMG) at [[Umeå University]], [[Sweden]], but primarily operative at [[Abisko Scientific Research Station]] which is run by the [[Swedish Polar Research Secretariat]].

== Research ==
The CIRC research is focused on increasing the knowledge about [[Arctic]] and [[alpine climate]] [[ecosystem]]s, for better understanding of [[climate]] related impacts on [[subarctic]] and arctic environments, both in [[terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] (land based) and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic ecosystems]].

Within the field of [[arctic ecology]] CIRC researchers conduct projects about how the [[tree line]] is affected by [[climate change]]; how [[reindeer]]s influence [[Fell]] vegetation, and the spread of fish species in lakes and watercourses – historically as well as in the light of recent climate change.

In [[biogeochemistry]] researchers study [[watercourse]]s in northern areas, as well as effects of thawing [[permafrost]] in the [[tundra]] and other [[alpine climate|alpine environments]], with regard to [[emission intensity|emissions]] of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] to the [[atmosphere]] and [[export]] of [[carbon]] to coastal areas.

[[King Carl XVI Gustaf Professorship in Environmental Science]] 2017/18 was awarded to [[John Anderson (physiographist)|John Anderson]], professor in [[physical geography]] and [[paleolimnology]] at [[Loughborough University]] in the [[United Kingdom]], who will be [[visiting professor]] at CIRC these two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kungahuset.se/press/pressmeddelanden/2016/2016pressmeddelanden/innehavareavhmkonungensprofessurimiljovetenskaputsedd.5.186e1cb158b43194193d9.html |title=Innehavare av H.M.

=== Major research projects ===
In 2016 CIRC was granted 37 million SEK over five years by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] for the project "Climate change induced regime shifts in northern lake ecosystems", with Jan Karlsson as principal investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Projects 2016 |url=https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en/research/grants/research-projects-2016 |website=The Wallenberg Foundations |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wallenberg Academy Fellows ===
As of 2017 three young researchers at CIRC are also appointed Wallenberg Academy Fellows – a career programme, initiated by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation in close collaboration with five royal academies and sixteen universities in Sweden, that provides long-term funding for the most promising young researchers of all disciplines to develop their projects.

== Education ==
Since 2002 CIRC also gives education, like courses in ''Arctic ecology, Arctic geoecology'' and ''Fell ecology'', and a postgraduate program. CIRC is also connected to the international cooperative network [[University of the Arctic]].

== History ==
CIRC was founded in 1996 and now (2017) employs some 50 researchers; professors, [[assistant professor]]s, [[post doc]]s, [[doctoral student]]s and visiting professors. Most CIRC researchers are also affiliated to Arcum, [[Arctic Research Centre at Umeå University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcum.umu.se/english/affiliated-researchers/science-and-technology/ |title=Arcum - Affiliated Researchers - Science and Technology |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

CIRC's first [[director (education)|science director]] was Reiner Giesler, professor in terrestrial ecology, who in 2015 was followed by Jan Karlsson, professor in physical geography with a specialization in aquatic biogeochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umu.se/forskning/popularvetenskap/forskarportratt/professorer-2012/jan-karlsson |title=Växthusgaser och produktivitet i akvatiska ekosystem |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coding bootcamps''' are intensive programs of [[software development]] which started in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/coding-bootcamps-are-replacing-computer-science-degrees/|title=Coding bootcamps are replacing computer science degrees|last=Choxi|first=Roshan|date=2015|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Coding bootcamps made their debut in 2011 with the Code Academy (now Starter League). Since then, many others have followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/what-hacker-apprenticeships-tell-us-about-the-future-of-education/251039/|title=What Hacker Apprenticeships Tell Us About the Future of Education|last=Moon|first=Joe|date=2012|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, there were 95 full-time coding bootcamp courses in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-2016-the-coding-bootcamp-bubble-is-bound-to-burst/|title=In 2016, The Coding Bootcamp Bubble Is Bound to Burst|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|date=2016|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of courses typically ranges from between 8 to 36 weeks, with most lasting 10 to 12 (averaging 12.9) weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- I am thinking that these subheadings could probably be merged into a single paragraph, though I am not quite sure how at the moment. -TheSandDoctor --&gt;
=== Collaboration with higher education ===
Following the increased popularity of coding bootcamps, some universities have started their own intensive coding programs or partnered with existing private coding bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/collaboration-in-higher-education-universities-coding-bootcamps|title=Collaboration in Higher Education: Universities + Coding Bootcamps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online coding bootcamps ===
There are various online options for online bootcamps. Bootcamps usually match students with a mentor and are also generally cheaper and more accommodating to specific student needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-08-11/4-things-to-know-about-online-coding-boot-camps|title=4 Things to Know About Online Coding Boot Camps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data science bootcamps and fellowships ===
Bootcamps that focus less on [[Solution stack|full stack development]] and more on producing [[Data science|data scientists]] and 
[[Information engineering|data engineers]] are known as data science bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-%22Data-Scientist%22-q-%22Data-Engineer%22.html|title="Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer" Job Trends|website=www.indeed.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tuition ==

Coding bootcamps can be part-time or online, they may be funded by employers or qualify for student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/|title=Edtech’s Next Big Disruption Is The College Degree|last=Skonnard|first=Aaron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 market research report, tuition ranged from free to $21,000 for a course, with an average tuition of $11,874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deferred Tuition" refers to a payment model in which students pay the school a percentage (18%-22.5%) of their salary for 1–3 years after graduation, instead of upfront tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-deferred-tuition-income-share-agreements|title=Deferred Tuition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, coding bootcamps can be free or a couple thousand euros per program. In contrast to formal university education, private offerings for training appear expensive. {{Citation needed|reason= Please cite|date=April 2018}}

On August 16, 2016, the US Department of Education announced up to $17 million in loans or grants for students to study with nontraditional training providers, including coding bootcamps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-to-fund-nontraditional-training-for-students-1471341782|title=Obama Administration to Fund Nontraditional Training for Students|last=Mitchell|first=Josh|date=2016-08-16|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grants or loans will be administered through the pilot program, EQUIP which stands for Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-08-16-the-equip-eight-dept-of-ed-selects-partners-for-higher-education-experiment|title=The EQUIP Eight: Dept. of Ed Selects Partners for Higher Education Experiment (EdSurge News)|date=2016-08-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs must partner with an accredited college and third-party quality assurance entity (QAE) in order to receive federal financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/18/groups-seek-become-quality-reviewers-boot-camps-online-courses-and-other-noncollege|title=Groups seek to become quality reviewers of boot camps, online courses and other noncollege offerings|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2016, there were concerns that partnering private coding bootcamps with federal financial aid could attract less reputable organizations to create coding bootcamp programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2016/08/22/keep-coding-bootcamps-great-dont-give-them-taxpayer-money/#7821bb1350a0|title=Keep Coding Bootcamps Great: Don't Give Them Taxpayer Money|last=Cooper|first=Preston|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers to entry and exit mean established schools face less competition than in a free market, which can lead to deterioration of quality, and increase in prices. Also, problems within traditional university models could easily transfer to the university/bootcamp partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/16/colleges-partner-with-training-bootcamps-and-online-course-providers-for-federal-experiment/|title=Colleges partner with training boot camps and online course providers for federal experiment|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, others believe that enhancing policy around financial aid will help lower income prospective students attend. There are several sentiments of coding bootcamps being accessible only for the rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/06/are-coding-bootcamps-only-for-the-rich/|title=Are coding bootcamps only for the rich?|last=Pathak|first=Prasid|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14275">'''Community-driven development''' (CDD) is a [[development initiative]]{{what|date=September 2016}} that provides control of the [[economic development|development process]], resources and [[decision making]] authority directly to groups in the community. The underlying assumption of CDD projects are that communities are the best judges of how their lives and livelihoods can be improved and, if provided with adequate resources and information, they can organize themselves to provide for their immediate needs. CDD projects work by providing poor communities with direct funding for development with the communities then deciding how to spend the money. Lastly, the community plans and builds the project and takes responsibility for monitoring its progress.

== Characteristics of CDD ==
CDD programmes are motivated by their trust in people (Naidoo and Finn, 2001) and hence it advocates people changing their own [[Social environment|environment]] as a powerful force for development.

By treating poor people as assets and partners in the development process, studies have shown that CDD is responsive to local demands, inclusive, and more cost-effective compared to centrally-led [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-based programmes. CDD can also be supported by strengthening and financing [[community group]]s, facilitating community access to information, and promoting an enabling environment through policy and [[institutional reform]] (Dongier, 2002).

Following from this description, field practitioners at the [[World Bank]] have denoted five key characteristics of CDD projects.
# A CDD operation primarily targets a [[community-based organization]] or a representative local council of a community. This community focus means that the essential defining characteristic of a CDD project is that the beneficiaries or grantees of implementations are agents of the community. Since the focus on small communities is so large the CDD normally targets small scale [[subproject]]s in the community.
# In CDD operations, community- or locally based representation is responsible for designing and planning the subprojects in a participatory manner. Since the concentration on participatory planning is considerable in CDD operations, often the possible types of subproject [[investment]] options are very large with only a small list of subprojects that cannot be carried out.
# The defining characteristic of CDD projects is that a transfer of resources to the community occurs and control of the resources is delegated to the community. The amount of transfer and control of resources will depend on the CDD implementations.
# The community is directly involved in the implementation of the subproject. Often the participation of the community comes directly in the form of labour or funds. However, the community may also contribute to the subproject indirectly in the form of management and supervision of contractors or the operation and maintenance of the [[infrastructure]] when complete.
# An element of community-based [[monitoring and evaluation]] has become a characteristic of CDD subprojects. Most often it is [[social accountability]] tools such as [[participatory monitoring]], community scorecards and [[grievance redress]] systems which allow for the community to ensure accountability of the CDD implementation.

== CDD vs. CBD ==
Community-driven development is derived from [[community-based development]] (CBD) which can include a much broader range of projects. For example, CBD projects can include everything from simple [[information sharing]] to social, economic and political empowerment of community groups. However, CDD projects fit on the [[empowerment]] end of CBD by actively engaging beneficiaries in the design, management and implementation of projects. The stress on actual control of decision-making and project resources at nearly all stages of a subproject cycle distinguishes CDD from the previous generation of CBD projects. In this continuum of [[community participation]] covered by CBD, new-generation CDD projects are located at the extreme right (Tanaka, 2006).

Since community-driven development has only recently diverged from the broad community-based development there are a few contrasts visible in the five characteristics of CDD programmes. In essence, all five properties of CDD projects exist together only in the newer generation of CDD implementations. Nevertheless, the first attribute of community focus would apply to all CDD projects and CBD projects. In contrast, the second characteristic of [[participatory planning]] and design and the fourth property of community involvement are often visible among all CDD projects but very rarely in CBD projects. Moreover, community-based monitoring and evaluation which is the fifth aspect of CDD projects is only found in some of the newer projects. The fifth characteristic is what positions many of the newer CDD projects in the extreme right of the CDD cluster as diagrammatically demonstrated in Figure 1. As mentioned above, the third characteristic of community control of resources seems to be the key factor to conceptually distinguish between CDD and CBD projects. However, many of the early NGOs implementing CDD projects did not always interpret this factor rigorously (Tanaka, 2006). Thus, the distinction between CDD projects and CBD projects with CDD components was not always clear; however, this would be expected since there was a gradual evolution of CDD out of CBD.

To alleviate the earlier problems of over-reliance on [[central government]]s as the main [[service provider]], CDD programs were launched by the World Bank to improve the accountability and services in key areas. However, NGOs quickly learned that well designed and implemented CDD programmes had ripple effects of promoting equity and inclusiveness, [[efficiency]] and good governance. By effectively targeting and including the vulnerable and excluded groups, as well as allowing communities to manage and control resources directly it was evident that CDD programs could allow poverty reduction projects to scale up quickly. Efficiency is gained through demand responsive allocation of resources, reduced corruption and misuse of resources, lower costs and better [[cost recovery]], better quality and maintenance, greater utilization of resources, and the community‘s willingness to pay for goods and services. Good governance is promoted by greater transparency, accountability in allocation and use of resources because the community participates in project decision-making processes. Some of the principles of CDD—such as participation, empowerment, accountability, and [[nondiscrimination]]—are also worthy ends in themselves ([[Asian Development Bank]], 2008).

It was as early as 1881 when [[T.H. Green]] who wrote about the maximum power for all members of [[human society]] alike to make the best of themselves (Zakaria, 1999). However, it was not until the 1970s with [[John Rawls]]’ book ―[[A Theory of Justice]] and in the 1990s with [[Amartya Sen]]‘s book ―[[Development as Freedom]] where the notions of [[substantive freedom]] and the multidimensional nature of [[poverty]] were made explicit to the [[multilateral development bank]]s. This recognition of the multidimensional nature of poverty as well as the combined failures of both markets and governments and the socio-political complexity of ground level realities has made it clear that relying on traditional top-down, state-led, ―big development‖ strategies would not be effective to combat poverty. Moreover, this resurgence in participatory development and bottom-up approaches in the NGO and [[development sector]] has come in only the last two decades as explained above.

== Expansion of community-driven development ==
Since the mid-1990s, community-driven development has emerged as one of the fastest-growing investments by NGOs, [[aid organization]]s and multilateral developments banks. This continued investment in CDD has been driven mostly by a demand from donor agencies and developing countries for large-scale, bottom-up and demand-driven, [[poverty reduction]] subprojects that can increase the institutional capacity of small communities for self-development.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Matous: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09614524.2013.772116 The making and unmaking of community-based water supplies in Manila], Development in Practice, Volume 23, Issue 2, 2013, p. 217-231.&lt;/ref&gt; The success and scale of some CDD projects in the World Bank are especially notable. The World Bank supported approximately 190 lending projects amounting to $9.3 billion in 2000–2005 (Tanaka, 2006). Initiated by the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) at the World Bank, CDD projects have been instrumental in harnessing the energy and capacity of communities for poverty reduction. Since the start of this decade, IDA lending for CDD has averaged annually just over 50 operations, for an average total of US$1.3 billion per year (International Development Association, 2009).

Even the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has funded 57 projects worth about $2.5 billion between 2001-2007 that included community-driven development approaches to enhance deliver of inputs and beneficiary participation. They constituted 14% of the total loans approved by the Asian Development Bank during this period. Over one-third of the projects were in the [[agriculture]] and [[natural resources]] sector, followed by a smaller proportion of [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], [[waste management]], [[education]] and [[health]] projects. The projects were primarily in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], where the [[developing country]] governments were investing in [[rural development]] programs (Asian Development Bank, 2008).

In the last few years the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] has been working with the [[French Development Agency|Agence française de développement]] (AFD), the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO), the [[UN Capital Development Fund]] (UNCDF) and the [[World Bank]] to create a platform for learning and sharing knowledge on community-driven development (International Fund for Agricultural Development, 2010). Intensive forms of community participation have been attempted in projects of several donors for many years. [[Bilateral donor]]s, such as the [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), have used CDD-type approaches for a long time as part of their sustainable livelihoods and integrated basic needs development assistance in developing countries. The [[Swedish International Development Agency]] (SIDA) and [[Danish International Development Agency]] have used CDD principles in the mandate of a rights-based approach to the development projects they fund (FAO, 2010).

More than 80 countries have now implemented CDD projects. The breadth and activities funded by the CDD programs at the World Bank can be explained by providing a brief overview of a few of them.

The Second [[National Fadama Development Project II]] (NFDP-II) targets the development of small scale [[irrigation]], especially in the low-lying alluvial floodplains or "[[Fadama]]‖. NFDP-II increased the productivity, living standards and development capacity of the economically active rural communities while increasing the efficiency in delivering implementation services to an estimated four million rural beneficiary households and raising the real incomes of households by 45 percent (African Development Bank, 2003). The [[Social Fund for Development]] in [[Yemen]] provided support 7 million people of which 49 percent were female and generated 8,000 permanent jobs. It also increased the number of girls‘ schools from 502 to 554 and [[basic education]] enrollment rates from 63 percent to 68 percent. The program focuses on helping the poor to help themselves through providing income-generating activities and building [[community infrastructure]] rather than making cash transfers (El-Gammal, 2004). The [[Social Investment Fund Project V]] in [[Honduras]] benefited 2.5 million people with the implementation of 2,888 projects (1,446 rehabilitated schools, about 700 new schools, 163 new health centers, 347 small water/sanitation systems, and 461 latrines) resulting in all children in the targeted areas attending [[primary school]]. In addition the project communities were provided with better access to health care assistance and access to running water (Perez de Castillo, 1998). The [[Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project]] (APRPRP) in [[India]] has help to organize 10.1 million rural poor women into community-based organizations that collectively save over US$770 million and leverage credit over $2.7 billion from commercial banks (World Bank, 2003). The [[Kecamatan Development Program]] (KDP) in [[Indonesia]] which is what the [[National Solidarity Program]] in [[Afghanistan]] is based on has benefitted 18 million people by providing better services which include more than 37,000 kilometers of local roads and 8,500 bridges, 9,200 clean [[water supply]] units, and 3,000 new or improved health posts. In addition, more than 1.3 million people obtained loans to start or complement local businesses through [[microfinancing]] (Guggenheim, 2004). Lastly, the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) in Afghanistan will be the focus of this research. In this implementation elected village-level community development councils, which include women, use grants and local labor to rebuild bridges and roads, fix schools and install [[water pump]]s to benefit 13 million people across Afghanistan thereby building state credibility and strengthening local [[democracy]].

"Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After a teaching career in England, Canada, [[Turkey]] and the United States, he retired as Professor Emeritus of [[Comparative religions]] from [[Boston University]] in 1991.

== Early life ==
Daud Rahbar grew up in [[Model Town, Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] between 1929 and 1949. The town was the first cooperative society in the Indian subcontinent, a suburb based on the design of a Hindu architect, Divan Khem Chand. The town was autonomous from Lahore City's jurisdiction, and sectioned into blocks. Each block was populated by either [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]] or [[Hindus]] (where the Hindus constitute the largest community). He remarked that his close association with Hindus "made the love of Hindu communities a natural condition of [his] soul."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=87}} His childhood was spent writing poetry (he took the pen name 'Rahbar' at the age of eight), gardening and walking with his father while discussing [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[Persian literature]]. He was an excellent tennis player.

== Family ==
Rahbar's father, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal (1894–1948), was named after [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="other_iqbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |title=The other Iqbal |publisher=The News International |author=Mohyeddin, Zia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620235743/http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A]] in [[Arabic]] and was the recipient of a State scholarship from the [[University of Cambridge]]. He studied under Arabist professors [[Edward G. Browne]], [[Reynold A. Nicholson|R.A. Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Ashley Bevan]]. After receiving his PhD, Iqbal was appointed Professor of [[Persian language]] at the [[University of the Punjab]] in 1922 and remained for 26 years. He was later appointed President of [[Oriental College, Lahore]].

Rahbar had five siblings. Rahbar married Sabiha Ahmed on 9 April 1950. The couple had two daughters, Sameera and Anisa. Sabiha's father Aga Ghiassudin Ahmed, was a lawyer and botanist and President of Agricultural College in [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]] (now [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]]). Sabiha was a poet as well, although she never received recognition.

His first cousin, [[Zia Mohyeddin]],&lt;ref name="other_iqbal" /&gt; is a well-known media personality and artist from [[Pakistan]], who played the lead role in ''[[Passage to India]] on Broadway'' and in several British television specials and movies.

== Education ==
Rahbar graduated from the [[Government College, Lahore]] with an M.A in Arabic in 1947. He received the McLeod Research Scholarship and was hired on to teach [[Arabic literature]] at [[Oriental College, Lahore]], where his father was President. In 1949, Rahbar went to [[Cambridge University]] and completed his PhD dissertation entitled ''Studies in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' under the supervision of [[Reuben Levy]]. After a short time in [[Lahore]], Rahbar accepted the position of Senior Teaching Fellow at [[McGill University]], Canada, in 1954, at the invitation of [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]. In 1956 he was appointed to the chair of Urdu and [[Pakistan studies]] at [[Ankara University]], Turkey, where he stayed until 1959. In 1959, he began lecturing in [[Islamic studies]] as well as enrolling in [[Christian theology]] seminars at the [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]], Connecticut, USA.

In 1962, he was appointed Visiting Professor of Urdu and Pakistan studies at [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]] and was awarded tenure from 1962 to 1966. In 1964, he took a two-year leave to teach at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where he began a systematic study of Indian and Western classical music, concentrating on achieving mastery of Indian classical vocal genres. In that same period, he began writing English poetry with the encouragement of [[David McCord]] and [[Louis Untermeyer]].

In 1967, Rahbar joined the faculty of [[Boston University]] where he taught until his retirement in 1991: initially at the School of Theology and from 1975 onwards at the Department of Religion in the College of Liberal Arts, where he was one of the department's most popular teachers, his courses on eastern religions enrolling hundreds of students each semester.

== Lahore International Islamic Colloquium ==
On 2 January 1958, he presented a paper to the International Islamic Colloquium in Lahore,&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x/abstract | title=The International Islamic Colloquium | author=Dodge, Bayard | journal=The Muslim World | year=1958 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of its kind that brought scholars of Islamic subjects together from across the world. Rahbar's paper, entitled ''The Challenge of Muslim Ideas and Social Values to Muslim Society'' produced criticism from conference attendees, to the point that he was not allowed to return to the platform to explain his points. Rahbar maintains that it was "an innocent and mild statement" that he did not perceive to be "radically unorthodox."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=303}} The opposing members of the conference asked the paper to be withdrawn later that day, but eventually agreed that an amended edition should be written. In the October 1958 issue of ''The Muslim World'',&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr" /&gt; the paper was published with an introductory note outlining the objections of the council and the amendments made thereafter. In his introductory note, Rahbar explained that much of the controversy was due to the inherent brevity of the statements. Therefore, he hoped that the expanded treatment would clarify those objections raised at the colloquium.

== Contributor to inter-civilizational and interfaith dialogue ==
Rahbar was raised as Muslim but converted to Christianity as a professor at [[Ankara University]]. He records in his memoir that he was baptised as a Christian by a Protestant United States Air Force Chaplain, Meredith Smith, in Ankara, on 6 July 1959.{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=385}} Rahbar noted that his conversion was not a result of the 1958 Colloquium, but was more closely related to the memories of [[Partition of India]] and the then environment in Turkey. He stated that the "categorical mercy" of the [[New Testament]] and the "Christian world seemed to...offer a spiritual home"{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=343}} from his growing pessimism. A couple of months later, Rahbar wrote ''A letter to Christian and Muslim Friends'' as a confession of faith.

This confession, however, was not fully accepted by some Muslim intellectuals. [[Khaled Ahmed (journalist)|Khaled Ahmed]], a Pakistani political and cultural analyst, stated that Rahbar's supposed conversion to Christianity was nothing more than a "myth created in Lahore"&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000. Khaled Ahmed has republished this article in his book ''Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask (Facts about Great Men we don't want to know)'', p. 176-186. Lahore: Vanguard, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who did not fully understand "what he really stood for."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained  that Rahbar's "entire career has been a defence of Islam"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and that "anyone who has read his ''Kalchar Kay Ruhani Anasir'' (Spiritual Elements of Culture)"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; will no longer need to question his faith, but rather realise that "he is tolerant of all faiths because he known the essence of them all."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His continued respect and appreciation for the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and [[Islam]] is demonstrated in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rahbar, Daud. "Muhammad and All Men." In {{cite book|author=John Robert Nelson|title=No man is alien: Essays on the Unity of Mankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdEUAAAAIAAJ|pp=64–84|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|id=GGKEY:P577BDY9T76 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the published version of his dissertation, ''God of Justice: A Study in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' published by E. J. Brill in 1960, Rahbar advanced the position that God's mercy is always subordinate to justice, so mercy is only available to believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Muhammad and the unbelievers: a Qur'anic study |last=Marshall |first=David |pages=79–85 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7007-1086-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to poetry and classical music theory &amp; composition ==
Throughout his academic career, Rahbar continued to make significant contributions to [[Urdu literature]] and music. He performed in concerts and poetry readings both in the United States and Pakistan. His love was for classical South Asian music, particularly the Agra School. His flair for poetic expression is infused throughout his autobiography, ''Memories and Meanings.'' "Music has been my solace for the last forty years," he wrote. "Without it I perhaps could not have been a friend to myself and to others. Music and poetry have made life easier for me everywhere and at every stage of my adult life.".{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=454}} His published works in the field of [[Urdu literature]] include:

* ''Salaam o Payaam.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1996 – Letters to his friends and associates. Subsequent volumes were published in 2004 and 2009.
* ''Kalcar ke Ruhani Anasir.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1998 – Culture and Religion.
* ''Pragandah Taba' Log.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2000 – Short stories.

== Death ==
Daud Rahbar died at a nursing home in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]] on 5 October 2013.&lt;ref name="ppf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/obituaries/73245/scholar-writer-daud-rahbar-passes-away-in-us/ | title=Scholar, writer Daud Rahbar passes away in US | publisher=Pakistan Press Foundation | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30613">In 1957, the research organization of the Chemicals Department of [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] was renamed '''Central Research Department''', beginning the history of the premier scientific organization within DuPont and one of the foremost industrial laboratories devoted to basic science.  Located primarily at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]] and Chestnut Run, in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], it has expanded to include laboratories in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], [[Seoul, South Korea]], [[Shanghai, China]], and [[Hyderabad, India]]. In January, 2016 a major layoff marked the end of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Jan. 25, 2016, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company established a tradition of basic scientific research starting with hiring of [[Wallace Carothers]] in 1928 and his systemization of polymer science that led to the development of polyamides such as nylon-6,6 and polychloroprene (neoprene) in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes, Matthew. Enough for One Lifetime, Wallace Carothers the Inventor of Nylon, Chemical Heritage Foundation, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8412-3331-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This tradition waned during [[World War II]] then underwent a renaissance in the 1950s.  The establishment of Central Research in 1957 formalized a corporate commitment to basic research.  The execution and publication of high quality research assisted recruiting and promoted the image of DuPont while raising morale among the CRD staff.  The purpose of the research was to discover "the next [[nylon]]", because Carothers' success and the resulting commercialization of nylon had driven the Company's profits through the 1950s.  (This research objective that was never met.)  Nonetheless, another important stated goal for CRD was “diversification through research,” and CRD produced a stream of scientific innovations that contributed to many different businesses throughout the corporation.

CRD combined industrial and fundamental research, and the mix of the two features was often determined by the head of CR&amp;D.  The title expanded from Director of Research to Vice President of Technology to Chief Technology Officer with varying degrees of impact on research throughout the corporation as well as in CRD.  The name of CRD also changed to reflect the times, starting with Chemicals Department and moving through Central Research Department (CRD), Central Research and Development Department (CR&amp;DD), to the present Central Research and Development (CR&amp;D).

CRD conducted research in a number of topical areas, often requiring an interdisciplinary approach.  DuPont’s explored chemical reactions in supercritical water in the 1950s to support its production of CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for [[magnetic recording]] tapes.  Hyperbaric recrystallization of ultra-high molecular weight [[polyethylene]] led to DuPont’s business in Hylamer polyethylene for bearing surfaces in hip and knee replacement [[arthroplasty]].  [[Urea]] and [[uracil]] compounds discovered in CRD were potent and selective [[herbicides]], propelling DuPont into the agricultural chemicals business and culminating in sulfonylurea herbicides.  [[Potassium titanyl phosphate]] or KTP is a versatile [[nonlinear optical]] material, originally designed to [[frequency doubling]] red [[laser]]s to green for bloodless laser eye surgery; it now find additional application in urological surgery and hand-held green [[laser]] pointers.

In the 1950s, the CRD housed a broad-based research program aimed largely at the synthesis and study of new classes of compounds.  Synthesis of new organic and inorganic compounds accounted for about half of the total research.  When the [[National Institute of Health]] invited DuPont to submit compounds to its screening efforts, they rated DuPont as submitting by far the most diverse range of compounds – pharmaceutical companies were submitting things that looked like pharmaceuticals, but DuPont submitted compounds that would be classed internally as catalysts, optical materials, monomers, oligomers, ligands, inorganics, and other unusual materials.

In addition to chemical synthesis, CRD maintained efforts centered on new physical and analytical techniques, chemical structure and reaction mechanism, and solid-state physics.  DuPont continued in polymer research.  Biological research has increased significantly.

Until recent years, a substantial portion of research was of an academic nature.  This academic research was reflected in the general atmosphere of the organization.  In the late 1960s, CRD established a program for recruiting [[postdoctoral]] fellows.  These fellowships were generally for two years and had the expectation that the fellow would leave to an academic institution.  Every year one or two DuPont scientists would take one year leaves of absence for university study and teaching.  It was also accepted that every year a number of scientists would leave DuPont for academic positions and that several professors would join the staff permanently.  A notable example was [[Richard Schrock]], who left CRD for [[MIT]] and won the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]].  CRD was supported by numerous high-profile consultants who have made significant contributions to DuPont.  [[John D. Roberts|Jack Roberts]] of [[Caltech]] and [[Carl Shipp Marvel|Speed Marvel]] each consulted for well over 50 years and provided a steady supply of well-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Howard's  DuPont patents span a period of over 50 years. From Edward G. Howard, Jr., ''Catalyst system of bromate ion-sulfoxy compounds for use in aqueous polymerization processes'', US  2560694 (1951) through Dennis Edward Curtin, and Edward George Howard, ''Compositions containing particles of highly fluorinated ion exchange polymer'' US7166685 B2 (2007), with about 100 patents between.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Robert Grubbs]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] with Schrock, consulted for many years.  These academic connections were sources of new generations of CRD researchers.

The scientific accomplishments of [[Theodore L. Cairns]], [[William Dale Phillips|William D. Phillips]], [[Earl Muetterties]], [[Howard E. Simmons, Jr.]], and [[George Parshall]] were recognized by their election to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

CRD management fostered an open and collaborative style.  At its founding, the division of labor in CRD was “management,” “bench chemists,” and “technicians,” with the management and bench chemists having separate but overlapped promotional tracks.  Under the [[Hay Grade]] system of pay levels that was employed then and now, there were eight professional or promotional levels for the “bench chemists,” yet there was a single undistinguished title.  This approach promoted interaction.

The Hay Grades for those in management started higher and ended considerably higher, but there was significant overlap with the bench chemist levels.  Thus it was not unusual for a supervisor or manager to have one or more scientists reporting to him (there were no females in management at this time) who were at higher pay levels than he was.  There was one reported instance where the supervisor never got to pass pay raises to the “bench chemist” because management didn’t want to make him feel bad; the next level Manager who did pass on the pay notification said, “They didn’t care how I felt.”  Titles explicitly tied to salary level were instituted in May, 1993, but the openness remains today as does the situation of Managers managing higher level scientists.

At the beginning of CRD, “technicians” in CRD were usually high-school educated and often had military service.  They were clearly just extra hands for the bench chemists who were all PhDs and the bench chemists were expected to spend most of their time at the bench.  It was virtually impossible for a technician to progress in CRD, but they could at plant sites and would sometimes move for the opportunity.  Starting in the early 1990s, mostly as a result of the growth of the pharmaceutical and life science efforts, technicians with [[Bachelors]] degrees and later, [[Master's degree]]s became the norm.  There are even some technicians holding PhDs from foreign universities.  Nonetheless, it remains difficult for a technician to break into the bench chemist ranks and they usually transfer to business units in search of more opportunity.

Many of the PhDs who came to CRD transferred to business units.  From the 1980s to early 90s, management tried to move all PhDs to a business unit within their first five years.  The PhDs had spent their entire lives in an academic environment, so they knew nothing else, but it was realized that at some point they would grow up and realize that working at the bench was not what some of them would want to do their entire career.  The issue was that they were too senior and naive to move into entry level positions in businesses and their competition were similarly aged BS engineers who would have had about five years of experience keeping a plant running.  Of those who took the opportunity, about half returned to CR&amp;D.  Of those who returned, about half left again.  The relatively high turnover provided more opportunity for CRD to hire outstanding new PhDs.  Transfers to business units became less common in the 1990s and the average age of CRD personnel rose considerably as a result. With baby-boomers starting to retire, there is more recruiting and there is a noticeable rejuvenation of the staff.

Responsibility for the technical direction of research has shifted to the chemist as they carry out short-term projects in support of the business units.  [[PhD]]s who get [[MBA]]s are now more common.  Unlike the early years, all management has had business unit experience and many were hired into business units, coming into CRD later in their careers.  These managers are often far more administrative in their approach, not having the strong technical backgrounds required to keep up with their technical employees.  Some managers have come to rely upon their senior technical staff, but there is no clear guideline on the role that these senior scientists can or should play in managing the programs and careers of the younger scientists.

In late 2015, the name of the organization was changed to DuPont Science and Innovation portending the major layoff on January 4, 2016, which marked the end of the organization as a major force in research.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Jan. 25, 2016, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Combined, the Molecular Sciences and Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering portions of CR&amp;D went from 330 employees to 34 in the new Science and Innovation organization.

==Organofluorine chemistry==
[[Image:Fluorocarbon backbone.png|150px|thumb|A fluorocarbon chain is the backbone of Teflon and related chemicals]]

On April 6, 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont’s Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey was working with gases related to DuPont’s [[Freon]] [[refrigerants]] when he and his associates discovered that a sample of gaseous [[tetrafluoroethylene]] had polymerized spontaneously into a white, waxy solid.  The polymer was [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) commercialized by DuPont as [[Teflon]] in 1945.  Because DuPont was basic in a variety of fluorinated materials, it was logical that organofluorine chemistry became important to DuPont.  The discovery that tetrafluorethylene would cyclize with a wide variety of compounds to give fluorinated compounds opened up routes to a range of [[organofluorine compound]]s.

The hazards and difficulties of handling highly reactive and corrosive fluorinating reagents could be accommodated by DuPont’s emphasis on safety and DuPont’s association with the [[Manhattan Project]] provided many chemists and engineers with the background necessary to carry out the work.  Availability of the Pressure Research Lab on the [[DuPont Experimental Station|Experimental Station]] provided the necessary protection for most but not all of those reactions that went awry.  Notable scientists included William Middleton, David England, Carl Krespan, William Sheppard, [[Owen Webster]], Bruce Smart, Malli Rao, Robert Wheland, and Andrew Feiring, all of whom filed many patents for DuPont.  Sheppard wrote one of the important early books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Sheppard and Clay M. Sharts, ''Organic Fluorine Chemistry'', 1969, W. A. Benjamin, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smart's book followed.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Banks, B.E. Smart, and J.C. Tatlow, ''Organofluorine Chemistry: Principles and Commercial Applications'' (Topics in Applied Chemistry), Springer (New York); 1 edition (September 30, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Smart’s comments in [[Chemical Reviews]] in 1996, “Scientific and commercial interests in fluorine chemistry burgeoned after 1980, largely fueled by the need to replace industrial chlorofluorocarbons and the rapidly growing practical opportunities for organofluorine compounds in crop protection, medicine and diverse materials applications.  Although fluorine is much less abstruse now than when I entered the field a generation ago, it remains a specialized topic and most chemists are unfamiliar, or at least uncomfortable, with the synthesis and behavior of organofluorine compounds,” remain true today.

CRD undertook a program on alternatives for [[chlorofluorocarbons]] in [[refrigerant]]s in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to [[stratospheric]] [[ozone]] were published.  The Catalysis Center of CRD, under the leadership of Leo Manzer, was quick to respond with new technology to produce alternative [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] ([[HCFC]]s) that were commercialized as DuPont's [[Suva]] refrigerants.

==Cyanocarbon chemistry==
[[Image:Cyanocarbon backbone.png|150px|thumb|A cyanocarbon polymer]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, CRD developed a program under the direction of Theodore Cairns to synthesize long-chain cyanocarbons analogous to long-chain fluorocarbons like Teflon.  The work culminated in a series of twelve papers in the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] in 1958.  Several authors of those papers grew to prominent positions at DuPont including Richard E. Benson (Associate Director, CRD), Theodore L. Cairns (Research Director, CRD), Richard E. Heckert (CEO of DuPont), William D. Phillips (Associate Director, CRD),  Howard E. Simmons (Research Director and VP, CRD), and Susan A. Vladuchick (Plant Manager). This trend indicates the importance of technical qualification for promotion in the company at that time.  The publication stimulated other researchers to investigate these compounds.

[[Image:Diiminosuccinonitrile.svg|120px|thumb|Diiminosuccinonitrile (DISN)]]
[[Image:DAMN Structure.png|120px|thumb|[[Diaminomaleonitrile]] (DAMN)]]

Prospective applications included dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, organic magnets, and incorporation in new types of polymers.  No commercial applications resulted from this extensive research effort.  Partly for this work, Cairns was awarded medals for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry by the [[American Chemical Society]] and the Synthetic Organic Award of the [[Chemical Manufacturers Association]].  Another line of chemistry developed around [[Owen Webster]]'s synthesis of diiminosuccinonitrile (DISN), which could be converted to [[diaminomaleonitrile]] (DAMN), leading to another series of patent and papers.  Simmons used [[sodium maleonitriledithiolate]] for the preparation many novel substances of including tetracyanothiophene, tetracyanopyrrole, and pentacyanocyclopentadiene.

==Metal oxides==
Arthur Sleight led a team focused on [[perovskite]]s, such as the K-Bi-Pb-O system, that laid the groundwork for subsequent breakthroughs in high-temperature [[superconductors]].&lt;ref&gt;Sleight, A. W.; Gillson, J. L.; Bierstedt, P. E.  High-temperature superconductivity in the barium plumbate bismuthate (BaPb&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) systems.

CHEMTECH (1976), 6(7), 468-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  In solution phase chemistry of oxides, the work of Walter Knoth on organic soluble [[polyoxoanion]]s led to the development of the now large area with numerous applications in oxidation catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, W. H.; Domaille, P. J.; Harlow, R. L. "Heteropolyanions of the types M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(W&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt; and MM'M"(W&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;: novel coordination of nitrate and nitrite"  Inorganic Chemistry (1986), 25, 1577-84.

==Dynamic NMR spectroscopy==
Indicative of interplay between applications and fundamental science were many studies on stereodynamics conducted at CRD by Jesson, Meakin, and Muetterties.  One of the early studies focused on the [[fluxional molecule|non-rigidity]] of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a reagent relevant to the preparation of fluorocarbons.  Subsequent studies led to the discovery of the first stereochemically non-rigid octahedal complexes of the type FeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Meakin, P. Muetterties, E. L.; Jesson, J. P. "Stereochemically Nonrigid Six-Coordinate Molecules. III. The Temperature-Dependent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Some Iron and Ruthenium Dihydrides" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1973, 95, pp 75&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymer science==
[[Owen Webster]] discovered [[group-transfer polymerization]] (GTP), the first new polymerization process developed since living anionic polymerization.  The major aspects of the mechanism of the reaction were determined and the process was quickly converted to commercial application for automotive finishes and [[ink jet]] inks.  The basic process of group transfer also has application to general [[organic synthesis]], including [[natural products]].&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Webster and coworkers, ''Group-transfer polymerization. 1. A new concept for addition polymerization with silicon initiators''. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105(1983):5706-5708.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, Andrew Janowicz developed a useful version of cobalt catalyzed chain transfer for controlling the molecular weight of [[free radical]][[polymerization]]s.  The technology has been further developed by Alexei Gridnev and [[Steven Ittel]].  It, too, was quickly commercialized and a fundamental understanding of the process developed over a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Alexei I. Gridnev and [[Steven Ittel|Steven D. Ittel]], Chemical Reviews, 101, 3611-3659 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolph Pariser]] was the director of the Advanced Materials Science and Engineering at the time of these advances.

In 1995, [[Maurice Brookhart]], professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] and a DuPont CRD consultant, invented a new generation of [[post-metallocene catalyst]]s for olefin [[coordination polymerization]] based upon late transition metals with his postdoctoral student, Lynda Johnson who later joined CRD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Ittel|Steven D. Ittel]], Lynda K. Johnson and [[Maurice Brookhart]], ''Late-Metal Catalysts for Ethylene Homo- and Copolymerization'', Chemical Reviews, 100, 1169&amp;ndash;1203, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology, DuPont’s Versipol olefin polymerization technology, was developed by a substantial team of CRD scientists over the next ten years.

CRD developed a major interest in [[inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] chemistry.  Earl Muetterties established a program aimed at fundamental borane chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, W. H.; Miller, H. C.; England, D. C.; Parshall, G. W.; Muetterties, E. L.   Derivative chemistry of B10H10-- and B12H12--.    Journal of the American Chemical Society  (1962),  84  1056-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Knoth discovered the first polyhedral borane anion, B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, and also discovered that the borane anions displayed a substitution chemistry similar to that of aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, Walter H., Jr.  Ionic boron compounds.  U.S. Patent 3390966 (1968).  Knoth, Walter H., Jr.  Neutral and singly charged derivatives of decaboranes and decaborates.  U.S. Patent 3296260 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Miller discovered the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; anion in an effort to find a new route to B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, Walter H. Jr.; Miller, Norman Earl. Salts of polyhedral polyborates. U.S. Patent 3334136  (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Parshall]] joined CRD in 1954.  His industrial sabbatical at [[Imperial College London]] with [[Geoffrey Wilkinson]] in 1960-61 introduced him to [[organometallic chemistry]].  Muetterties left DuPont to join the faculty of [[Cornell]] in 1973.  After Muetterties and Parshall, the organometallic chemistry group was led by [[Steven Ittel]] and then Henry Bryndza before it was dispersed throughout a number of groups in CRD.  Parshall and Ittel coauthored a book on “Homogeneous Catalysis”&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Parshall and S. D. Ittel, ''Homogeneous Catalysis'', 2nd Edition, Wiley Interscience, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; that has become the standard reference on the subject.

The seminal contributions of Richard Cramer and [[Fred Tebbe]] are acknowledged by their named compounds, “Cramer’s dimer,” Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the “[[Tebbe reagent]].”  Tebbe had an influence on his lab partner, [[Richard Schrock]] who initiated a program on M=C chemistry at DuPont and continued it when he moved to [[MIT]].  The chemistry forms the basis for [[olefin metathesis]], and Schrock ultimately shared the [[Nobel Prize]] with [[Robert Grubbs]], a CRD consultant, for the metathesis work.  [[Anthony Joseph Arduengo III|Anthony Arduengo]]’s [[persistent carbene]]s opened up a new area of chemistry and they have proven to be important ligands in the metathesis process.

There was a vigorous effort on the activation of C-H bonds with contributions by Parshall, Thomas Herskovitz, Ittel, and David Thorn.  [[Chadwick Alma Tolman|Chad Tolman]] developed his “[[ligand cone angle]]” theory that developed into the widely accepted electronic and steric effects of [[ligand]]s on [[inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Tolman, ''Steric Effects of Phosphorus Ligands in Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis'', Chemical Reviews, 1977, volume 77, pages 313-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organometallic chemistry in CRD has further included R. Thomas Baker's heterobinuclear complexes, Patricia L. Watson's organolanthanides, William A. Nugent's metal-ligand multiple bonds,&lt;ref&gt;William A. Nugent and James M. Mayer, ''Metal-Ligand Multiple Bonds: The Chemistry of Transition Metal Complexes Containing Oxo, Nitrido, Imido, Alkylidene, or Alkylidyne Ligands'', Wiley-Interscience; 1 edition (October 31, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffery Thompson's and Mani Subramanyam's development of [[technetium]] complexes for radiopharmaceuticals, and Bob Burch's and Karin Karel's fluoro-organometallic chemistry.  The major outlet for organometallic chemistry is homogeneous catalysis.  DuPont developed a major technology based upon the nickel catalyzed addition of two molecules of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to [[butadiene]], giving [[adiponitrile]], a [[nylon]] intermediate, initially through the work of [[William C. Drinkard]].  The mechanistic work to provide an understanding of the technology was done in CRD and led to a large program on next-generation technology before the business was sold to Koch Industries.  Other applications of homogeneous catalysis studied in CRD include [[ethylene]] [[polymerization]], [[cyclohexane]] [[oxidation]] to [[adipic acid]], and [[butadiene]] [[carbonylation]] to [[nylon]] intermediates.  Approaches to catalyst systems have included homogeneous organometallic catalysts, heterobinuclear catalysts, [[polyoxometalate]]s, [[enzymes]], catalytic [[membrane reactor]]s and supported organometallics.

==Photochemistry and physics==
David M. McQueen, one of the early Directors of CRD was a physical chemist from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His research on [[photochemistry]] and [[photography]] resulted in thirty-five patents.  It was his background that got CRD started in photochemistry and photophysics.  David Eaton later headed a strong team involved in photopolymerization color proofing for the printing industry.

There was a strong program in inorganic non-linear optical materials that resulted in optical frequency doubling for the “green lasers” mentioned above.  This program was extended into organic materials with NLO properties.

There was also a strong effort on materials for the display industry and methods for preparing devices for displays.  These included printable electronics, thermal transfer methods for color filters, [[carbon nanotubes]] for field emission displays, and [[OLED]] materials and devices.  A substantial effort was made on next generation [[photoresist]]s for the [[semiconductor]] industry containing [[hydrocarbon]] and [[fluorocarbon]] [[monomers]] to replace wavelengths of 193&amp;nbsp;nm with 157&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths for better resolution.  Though most of the requirements were achieved, the need for that shorter wavelength node was eliminated by the introduction of [[immersion lithography]] and new fluids for [[immersion lithography]] continue to be of substantial interest.  Development of [[phase-shift mask]]s was commercialized.

==Biological sciences==
One area always deemed important for diversification of CRD's programs was related to the biological sciences.  Charles Stine had promoted biochemistry as a field of research for Du Pont and Stine Laboratories are named in his honor as a result.  In the early 1950s, CRD began a program to investigate chemicals for biological applications.  Charles Todd prepared substituted ureas as potential antibacterial agents, which when screened, proved to be effective herbicides.  These led to DuPont’s very successful and very selective sulfonylurea herbicides.  CRD's program included agricultural and veterinary chemicals and bacteriological and microbiological studies.  The culmination of this work was DuPont’s purchase of [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] [[Seeds]] and its integration into DuPont’s agrichemical enterprise.

In the mid- 1950s, CRD began work on the chemistry of [[nitrogen fixation]] in plants, a study that would develop into a major effort over the next decade.  In 1963, Ralph Hardy joined the CRD and brought Du Pont's nitrogen fixation research to international prominence with more than a hundred papers on the subject.  [[Chemical Week]] called him, "one of the nation's top achievers in the dual role of scientist and scientific manager," though such managers remained common in CRD through the 1960s and 70s.

[[Industrial fermentation|Fermentation]] [[microbiology]] and selective [[genetic modification]] became important to the CRD development of a biological route to 1,3-propylene glycol a new monomer for making polyester.  The availability of this new monomer led to the development and commercialization of Sorona, a premium [[polyester]].  Substantial success was also achieved in the synthesis of unnatural peptides and proteins to accomplish specific functions and prediction of their tertiary structures.

Advances in [[DNA sequencing]] technology based on synthesis of novel [[fluorescent]] labels led to Qualicon, a DuPont venture that identifies [[bacteria]] by examination of their [[DNA]] using [[PCR]]. This technology has led to significant improvements in the safety of the [[food supply]] chain in the United States and around the world.

In [[music]], the '''dynamics''' of a piece is the variation in [[loudness]] between [[note (music)|notes]] or [[phrase (music)|phrases]]. Dynamics are indicated by specific [[musical notation]], often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a ''piano'' (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in [[timbre]] and sometimes [[tempo rubato]].
==Purpose and interpretation==
Dynamics are one of the [[musical expression|expressive elements of music]]. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiemel|first1=Matthias|title=Dynamics|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08458|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2017|ref=Grove Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{serif|'''''p'''''}} never indicates a precise level of [[loudness]], it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than {{serif|'''''f'''''}}. There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a [[phrase (music theory)|musical phrase]] will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked {{serif|'''''p'''''}} throughout.  Similarly, in [[polyphony|multi-part music]], some [[part (music)|voices]] will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a [[tuba]] playing ''piano'' will likely be louder than a [[guitar]] playing ''fortissimo'', while a high-pitched instrument like the [[piccolo]] playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

Further, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A ''forte'' passage is not usually "the same as a ''piano'' passage but louder". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like [[timbre]] or [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to [[tempo]]. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed "don't speed up just because it's getting louder!". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.{{efn|For instance, in Schubert's string quartet ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', the ''dimenuendo'' marking is followed by ''[[a tempo]]'', indicating that the dimenuendo is a reduction in speed as well as in loudness. In the same work Schubert uses ''decrescendo'' to indicate a reduction in loudness with no change in speed.}}

In some [[scorewriter|music notation program]]s, there are default [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's [[Logic Pro]] 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:
* {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or ''piano'', meaning "soft".&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite book |first=Don Michael |last=Randel |authorlink=Don Michael Randel |publisher=Harvard University Press Reference Library |location=Cambridge, MA, US |year=2003 |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vtp"&gt;{{cite web | title=Piano  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textp/Piano.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* {{serif|'''''mp'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-piano'',  meaning "half soft".
* {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-forte'',  meaning "half loud".&lt;ref name="vtd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Dynamics.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'', standing for ''più piano'' and meaning "softer".
* ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', standing for ''più forte'' and meaning "louder".

Use of up to three consecutive {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s or {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s is also common:
* {{serif|'''''pp'''''}}, standing for ''pianissimo'' and meaning "very soft".
* {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}, standing for ''fortissimo'' and meaning "very loud".
* {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, standing for ''pianississimo'' and meaning "more than very soft".
* {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, standing for ''fortississimo'' and meaning "more than very loud".&lt;ref name="vtd" /&gt;

[[Image:Dynamic's Note Velocity.svg|thumb|350px|Note Velocity is a [[MIDI]] measurement of the speed that the key travels from its rest position to completely depressed, with 127, the largest value in a 7-bit number, being instantaneous, and meaning as strong as possible. {{audio|MIDI dynamics fff to ppp.mid|Play a C major chord at each dynamic from fff to ppp}}]]

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* '''''crescendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|cresc.}}'') translates as "increasing" (literally "growing").
* '''''decrescendo''''' (abbreviated to ''{{serif|decresc.}}'') translates as "decreasing".
* '''''diminuendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|dim.}}'') translates as "diminishing".

Signs sometimes referred to as "[[hairpin]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (1996), entry "Hairpins".&lt;/ref&gt; are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up ([[File:Music-crescendo.svg|15x15px]]), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually ([[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|15x15px]]), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #2.5
        a4._\mf\&lt; gis16 a\! c4.\&gt; b8\! a4
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

Hairpins are usually written below the [[staff (music)|staff]] (or between the two staves in a [[grand staff]]), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for [[singer]]s or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few [[bar (music)|bars]]), while ''{{serif|cresc.}}'', ''{{serif|decresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|dim.}}'' are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word ''morendo'' ("dying") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).

For greater changes in dynamics, ''{{serif|cresc. molto}}'' and ''{{serif|dim. molto}}'' are often used, where the ''molto'' means "much". Similarly, for more gradual changes ''{{serif|poco cresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|poco dim.}}'' are used, where "poco" translates as ''a little'', or alternatively with ''poco a poco'' meaning "little by little''.

Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word ''subito'' (meaning "suddenly") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. ''Subito piano (''abbreviated ''{{serif| sub. '''p'''}}'') ("suddenly soft") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the {{serif|'''''p'''''}} range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the ''piano'' {{serif|'''''p'''''}} dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.

{{anchor|Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes}}
[[Accent (music)|Accented notes]] can be notated  ''sforzando'', ''sforzato'', ''forzando'' or ''forzato'' (abbreviated {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}) ("forcing" or "forced"), or using the sign '''&gt;''', placed above or below the head of the note.

''Sforzando'' (or ''sforzato'', ''forzando'', ''forzato'') indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}} or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}. There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerou |first=Tom |first2=Linda |last2= Lusk |title= Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation |year=1996 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |location= Van Nuys, CA |isbn= 978-0882847306 |pages=37–38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=sf+sfz+fz#v=onepage&amp;q=sf%20sfz%20fz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the ''sforzando'' is determined purely by the performer.

The [[fortepiano (musical dynamic)|fortepiano]] notation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}} indicates a ''forte'' followed immediately by ''piano''. By contrast, {{serif|'''''pf'''''}} is an abbreviation for ''poco forte'', literally "a little loud" but (according to Brahms) meaning ''with the character of forte, but the sound of piano'', though rarely used because of possible confusion with ''[[#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|pianoforte]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreysolow.com/Writings/AnEnigmaticMarkingExplainedVcS.doc An Enigmatic Marking Explained], by Jeffrey Solow, Violoncello Society Newsletter, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While the typical range of dynamic  markings is from {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the [[orchestration]] of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

==History==
''On Music'', one of the ''[[Moralia]]'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plutarch]] in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does [[rhythm]] or [[harmony]].

The [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[composer]] [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] was one of the first to indicate dynamics in [[music notation]], but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used some dynamic terms, including ''forte'', ''piano'', ''più piano'', and ''pianissimo'' (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} was considered to mean ''pianissimo'' in this period.

The fact that the [[harpsichord]] could play only "terraced" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the "somewhat misleading suggestion that [[Baroque music|baroque]] dynamics are 'terraced dynamics'," writes [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Donington|Donington, Robert]]: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote that "Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft."&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the [[harpsichord]] in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.

In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] specified six levels ({{serif|'''''pp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] used also {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}} (the latter less frequently), and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40)]], he uses the expressions {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, ''molto piano'', and ''[[quasi niente]]'' to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'' and ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', making for a total of ten levels between {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. [[Dynamic range compression]] is used to control the [[Dynamic range#Music|dynamic range]] of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Audio|last=Katz|first=Robert|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=0-240-80545-3|location=Amsterdam: Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and macro scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/dynamic-range-loudness-war|title='Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War|last=Deruty|first=Emmanuel|date=September 2011|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=2018-01-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, the meaning of the term ''dynamics'' is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term ''performed dynamics'' can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elowsson|first=Anders|last2=Friberg|first2=Anders|date=|title=Predicting the perception of performed dynamics in music audio with ensemble learning|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/4106.pdf|journal=The Acoustical Society of America|volume=141 |issue=3|pages=2224–2242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Netherlandish painting''' is the work of artists, sometimes known as the '''Flemish Primitives''', active in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] and [[Habsburg Netherlands]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]], especially in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Mechelen]], [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], [[Tournai]] and [[Brussels]], all in present-day [[Belgium]]. The period begins approximately with [[Robert Campin]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523,&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"&gt;Spronk (1996), 7&lt;/ref&gt; although many scholars extend it to the start of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in 1566 or 1568 ([[Max J. Friedländer]]'s acclaimed surveys run through [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and [[High Renaissance|High]] [[Italian Renaissance]] but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the [[Renaissance humanism]] that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, [[Renaissance]] ideals and painting styles were incorporated into Netherlandish and other Northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the [[Northern Renaissance]] and the Late or [[International Gothic]].

The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Dieric Bouts]], [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and [[illusionism (art)|illusionism]], and their work typically features complex [[iconography]].  Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of [[diptych]]s, [[triptych]]s or [[polyptych]]s. The period is also noted for its sculpture, [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[stained glass]] and carved [[retable]]s.

The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the [[Low Countries]] became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of [[iconoclasm]] in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated.

Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: [[Max J. Friedländer]] (''From Van Eyck to Breugel'' and ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'') and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'').

==Terminology and scope==
The term "Early Netherlandish art" applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"/&gt; in the northern European areas controlled by the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Dukes of Burgundy]] and later the [[Seventeen Provinces|Habsburg dynasty]]. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name ="Pächt30"&gt;Pächt (1999), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|left|460px|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432 by Jan van Eyck. This polyptych and the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are generally seen as the first major works of the Early Netherlandish period.]]

The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. "Late Gothic" is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the [[medieval art|art of the Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="janson"&gt;Janson, H.W. (2006), 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the artists were variously referred to in English as the "[[Ghent-Bruges school]]" or the "Old Netherlandish school". "Flemish Primitives" is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French ''primitifs flamands''&lt;ref name="C7"/&gt; that became popular after the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|famous exhibition in Bruges in 1902]]&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Flemish and Netherlandish art were only distinguished from each other from the early 17th century. See Spronk (1997), 7}} and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; In this context, "primitive" does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. [[Erwin Panofsky]] preferred the term ''[[ars nova]]'' ("new art"), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]], who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 165&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian dukes]] established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"/&gt; According to [[Otto Pächt]] a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a "revolution took place in painting"; a "new beauty" in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with [[Jan van Eyck]] identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French.&lt;ref name="Deam"&gt;Deam (1998), 15&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school's genesis was in France or Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 271&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Friedländer]], Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as "Early Netherlandish painting", although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.&lt;ref name="Deam" /&gt;

In the 14th century, as [[Gothic art]] gave way to the [[International Gothic]] era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as [[Melchior Broederlam]] and [[Robert Campin]], the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"&gt;Pächt (1999), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and [[House of Valois-Anjou]] dukes such as [[Philip the Bold]], [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Anjou]] and [[Jean, Duke of Berry]]. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, [[Philip the Good]] and his son [[Charles the Bold]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and [[old master print|prints]], both [[engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as [[Martin Schongauer]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref name="n3"&gt;Nash (2008), 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians are divided as to whether the central panel was intended as a moral warning or as a panorama of paradise lost]]
Following van Eyck's innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12ff"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 19"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Huizinga]] said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to "fill with beauty" the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble ''[[Madonna of Bruges|Madonna and Child]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] to Bruges in 1506,&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt; and the arrival of [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 321&lt;/ref&gt; Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo's ''Madonna'' based on a type developed by [[Hans Memling]].&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt;

Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists.&lt;ref name="C7"&gt;Campbell (1998), 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions.&lt;ref name="h6061"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of [[Renaissance humanism]], turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319–322&lt;/ref&gt; A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of [[Northern Mannerism]] around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.&lt;ref name="h60"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;  This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour,&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 25&lt;/ref&gt; peaking with the [[Limbourg brothers]] and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are usually attributed.&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]]. According to [[Georges Hulin de Loo]], Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours "constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art".&lt;ref name ="Pächt179"&gt;Pächt (1999), 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan van Eyck's use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated,&lt;ref name="Pächt11"/&gt; indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments,&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"&gt;Toman (2011), 322&lt;/ref&gt; and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from [[Bohemia]] and Poland in the east to Austria and [[Swabia]] in the south.&lt;ref name ="K55"/&gt;

A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in [[Tournai]].&lt;ref name ="Pächt16"&gt;Pächt (1999), 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vlieghe"&gt;Vlieghe (1998), 187–200. Highlights recent instances where institutions in the [[Wallonia|French-speaking parts of Belgium]] have refused to loan painters to exhibitions labelled "Flemish".&lt;/ref&gt; The German Hans Memling and the Estonian [[Michael Sittow]] both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. [[Simon Marmion]] is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from [[Amiens]], an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471.&lt;ref name="C7" /&gt; The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent.&lt;ref name="b35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="C20" /&gt;{{efn-ua|Van Eyck used elements of the [[Greek alphabet]] in his signature, and a number of [[Ghent]] painters taught members of their workshops to read and write.}} A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe.&lt;ref name="a24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a [[valet de chambre]] at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good.&lt;ref name="a24" /&gt; Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine "Mettengelde" ("with the money").&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet (1980), 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vrancke van der Stockt]] invested in land.&lt;ref name="C20"/&gt;

[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington. Van der Weyden moved portraiture away from idealisation and towards more naturalistic representation.&lt;ref name="V76"&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 76&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as [[Stefan Lochner]] and the painter known as the [[Master of the Life of the Virgin]], both of whom, working in mid-15th-century [[Cologne]], drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts.&lt;ref name="TB247"&gt;Borchert (2011), 247&lt;/ref&gt; New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]] were the most important artistic centres in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for [[printmaking]] (using woodcuts or copperplate [[engraving]]) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy.&lt;ref name ="K55"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as [[Jan Gossaert]] made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's ''[[Madonna in the Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard David linked the styles of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]], often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local [[Guild of Saint Luke|painters' guild]], and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 96&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision.&lt;ref name="TB101"&gt;Borchert (2011), 101&lt;/ref&gt; Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. [[Hieronymus Bosch]], active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref name="t335"&gt;Toman (2011), 335&lt;/ref&gt; He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]''. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the [[triptych]]s, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period&lt;ref name="t335" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Hand et al. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|350px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565. [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna. The most famous of Bruegel's several winter landscapes, the panel is indicative of how painting in the mid-16th century tended towards the secular and everyday life.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background.&lt;ref name = "A326"&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his [[genre art|genre scenes]] were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.&lt;ref name = "A326"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1998), 381–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and material==
Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 378&lt;/ref&gt; and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted "gold that looked like gold"),&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 163&lt;/ref&gt; paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]. They moved beyond the flat [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.&lt;ref name="j9"&gt;Jones (2011), 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dieric Bouts - The Entombment - WGA02961.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Dieric Bouts]]'s ''[[The Entombment (Bouts)|The Entombment]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1440–55 ([[National Gallery]], London), is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief, and one of the few surviving 15th-century glue-size paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although, the use of oil as a [[Binder (material)|binding agent]] can be traced to the 12th century, innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era. [[Tempera|Egg tempera]] was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail&lt;ref name="s61"&gt;Smith (2004), 61&lt;/ref&gt; and enable [[wet-on-wet]] techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams,&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 22&lt;/ref&gt; This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas.{{efn-ua|From contemporary records, it is estimated that about a third were painted on canvas, but as these were far less durable, most extant works are on wooden panels. See Ridderbos (2005), 297}} The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.&lt;ref name="C29"&gt;Campbell (1998), 29&lt;/ref&gt; Wood supports allow for [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes that most are "beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins".&lt;ref name="C31"&gt;Campbell (1998), 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, "done for the artist's amusement".&lt;ref name="C29"/&gt; Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk (1997), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.&lt;ref name="C31" /&gt;

[[Glue-size|Glue]] binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived.&lt;ref name="C29" /&gt; Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' ''[[Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1415–25)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511144111/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine |date=2012-05-11 }}.

''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]].&lt;ref name="C31"/&gt;

==Guilds and workshops==
The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan [[guild]]s to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1976), 190–192&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt;

Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase.&lt;ref name="A34"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 34&lt;/ref&gt; Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a "[[masterpiece]]" that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants.&lt;ref name="h95"&gt;Harbison (1995), 64&lt;/ref&gt; Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'', in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a [[crossbow]] to reflect its commission for a chapel for the [[Leuven]] guild of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 9–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices.&lt;ref name="J28"&gt;Jones (2011), 28&lt;/ref&gt; The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale.&lt;ref name="A32"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 32&lt;/ref&gt; With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak [[Deesis]] passage in van Eyck's ''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych'' being a better-known example.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 86&lt;/ref&gt; Often a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 29&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the master would usually produce the [[underdrawing]] or overall composition to be painted by assistants.  As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patronage==

Mary is overly large, symbolizing her heavenly status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), 169–187&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast, the north German and Polish regions, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments.&lt;ref name="J28"/&gt; The mid-century saw the development of [[art dealer]]ship as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt;

Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs,&lt;ref name="A37"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 37&lt;/ref&gt; or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt;

Less expensive cloth paintings (''[[Glue-size|tüchlein]]'') were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', which exists in several variations.&lt;ref name="A31"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt; Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great-uncles including [[John, Duke of Berry]] by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks.&lt;ref name="patronage"&gt;Chapuis, Julien. "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/valo_1/hd_valo_1.htm Patronage at the Early Valois Court]". ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]''. Retrieved 28 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts, gold-edged tapestries and jewel-bordered cups. Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the "excellent work that he does in his craft".&lt;ref name="J25"&gt;Jones (2011), 25&lt;/ref&gt; Jan van Eyck painted the ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' while in Philip's employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke's portrait painter in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="patronage"/&gt;

Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries. Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists, such as Bouts' ''[[:commons:File:Dirk Bouts - Justice of Emperor Otto III- Beheading of the Innocent Count and Ordeal by Fire - Google Art Project.jpg|Justice for Emperor Otto III]]'', van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' and David's ''[[:commons:File:David Diptych The Judgment of Cambyses.jpg|Justice of Cambyses]]''.&lt;ref name ="A30"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30&lt;/ref&gt; Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative, but they brought notice to and increased a painter's reputation, as with Memling, whose ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'' for Bruges' [[Old St. John's Hospital|Sint-Janshospitaal]] brought him additional civic commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants.&lt;ref name="J28" /&gt;  Although first-rank painters such as [[Petrus Christus]] and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility, they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt; Painters not only exported goods but also themselves; foreign princes and nobility, striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court, hired painters away from Bruges.&lt;ref name="A25"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua| The [[Federico da Montefeltro|Duke of Urbino]] hired [[Justus van Gent|Joos van Gent]] in c.&amp;nbsp;1473, and [[Isabella I of Castile]] – who owned a collection of 300 paintings – hired [[Michael Sittow]] and [[Juan de Flandes]] ("John of Flanders") into her service.

==Iconography==
[[File:The Magdalen Reading - Rogier van der Weyden.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'', before 1438. [[National Gallery]], London. This fragment is unusually rich in iconographical detail, including the Magdalen's averted eyes, her attribute of ointment, and the concept of Christ as the word represented by the book in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 392–405&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references.&lt;ref name="w11"&gt;Ward (1994), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the ''[[Life of the Virgin|Life of Mary]]'' vastly predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2006), 708&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps "the most important aspect of early Flemish art".&lt;ref name ="Harbison601"&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic.&lt;ref name="Harbison601"/&gt; Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details.&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and "was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation".&lt;ref name = "Ward9"&gt;Ward (1994), 9&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular "always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality".&lt;ref name="Harbison589"/&gt;  To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, "descriptive data were rearranged&amp;nbsp;... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth."&lt;ref name="Harbison589"&gt;Harbison (1984), 589&lt;/ref&gt;  This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the "essential truth of Christian doctrine" can be found in "the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol".&lt;ref name = "H590"&gt;Harbison (1984), 590&lt;/ref&gt; He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.&lt;ref name = "H590"/&gt;

Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the ''[[Lucca Madonna]]''). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 590–592&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing,&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a "promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1994), 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 591–593&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed."&lt;ref name="h596"&gt;Harbison (1984), 596&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of architectural details, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".&lt;ref name="h596" /&gt;

Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="j14"&gt;Jones (2011), 14&lt;/ref&gt; Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the ''[[Cambrai Madonna]]'' is probably the best known.&lt;ref name="h159"&gt;Harbison (1991), 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption into heaven]]. In a culture that venerated the possession of [[relic]]s as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 18&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in [[limbo]] was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the [[Man of Sorrows]].&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Those who could afford to commissioned [[donor portrait]]s. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length [[Madonna (art)|Marian portraits]]. These echoed the "miracle-working" Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.&lt;ref name="thb206"&gt;Borchert (2011), 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats==
Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved [[retable]]s, [[stained glass]], brass objects and carved [[tomb]]s.&lt;ref name="sn87"&gt;Nash (2008), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Susie Nash]], by the early 16th century, the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture, "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them".&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and [[metalwork]], which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"&gt;Campbell (1976) 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's [[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of Charles the Bold - WGA25709.jpg|portrait]] of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck's lost ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]''.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1993), 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2002), i–ix&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of [[donor portrait]]s, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'' and van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of [[landscape art|landscape painting]] as a separate genre.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"&gt;Jones (2011), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminated manuscript===
[[File:Girart de Roussillon (full page).jpg|thumb|320|Master of Girart de Roussillon, c.&amp;nbsp;1450, Burgundian wedding (Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal). [[Austrian National Library]], Vienna]]
Before the mid-15th century, illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Harbison (1995), 47&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts were ideally suited as [[diplomatic gift]]s or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 27&lt;/ref&gt; From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French ''libraires'') produced [[books of hours]] (collections of prayers to be said at [[canonical hours]]), [[psalter]]s, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At the start of the 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to "include as many pictures as they could afford", which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of [[indulgence]]. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer,&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in Christus' 1450–60 panel ''Portrait of a Young Man'', now in the [[National Gallery]], which shows a small leaf with text to the ''[[Veil of Veronica|Vera icon]]'' illustrated with the head of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/petrus-christus-portrait-of-a-young-man Portrait of a Young Man]". ''[[National Gallery]]'', London. Retrieved 4 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and [[Utrecht]]. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt;

The [[Limbourg brothers]]'s ornate ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the [[Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy]] explored the same mix of illusionism and realism.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"/&gt; The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from [[Black death|plague]].&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G.&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 83&lt;/ref&gt; A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Livre du cœur d'amour épris - vindobo2597 - f25v.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Barthélemy d'Eyck]]'s chivalrous and romantic leaf from his "Livre du cœur d'Amour épris", c.&amp;nbsp;1458–60]]
A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of [[Liturgical book|liturgical texts]].&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death.&lt;ref name="Metmanuscripts"&gt;Jones, Susan. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe"]. ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art''. Retrieved 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Kren, Philip's "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety".&lt;ref name="k8"/&gt; Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and [[Margaret of York]]; his granddaughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]; and to his son-in-law, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] and the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|English Royal Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, [[James IV of Scotland]] and [[Eleanor of Viseu]].&lt;ref name="sn93"&gt;Nash (2008), 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Folio 153r - The Death of Christ.jpg|thumb|140|Limbourg brothers, ''The Death of Christ'', folio 153r, [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].]]
There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the "Hours of Raoul d'Ailly".&lt;ref name="nash428"&gt;Nash (1995), 428&lt;/ref&gt; Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt; The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.&lt;ref name="k8"&gt;Kren (2010), 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt;

Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text.&lt;ref name="sn923"&gt;Nash (2008), 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Hours of Mary of Burgundy|Nassau book of hours]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1467–80) by the [[Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy]], in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] (possibly [[Gerard Horenbout]]),&lt;ref name="sn94"&gt;Nash (2008), 94&lt;/ref&gt; known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"&gt;Harbison (1995), 29&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as [[William Young Ottley]], leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Wieck (1996), 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapestry===
[[File:The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn, fragment (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|"The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn", fragment from ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'', 1495–1505. [[The Cloisters]], New York]]

During the mid-15th century, [[tapestry]] was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of [[Arras]], Bruges and [[Tournai]]. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, [[Pope Julius II]] sent [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|cartoons]] to Brussels to be woven into hangings.&lt;ref name="n88"&gt;Nash (2008), 88&lt;/ref&gt; Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the [[Congress of Arras]] in 1435,&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (''tout autour'') with tapestries showing scenes of the "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege".&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"/&gt; At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]''.&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"&gt;Freeman (1973), 1&lt;/ref&gt; For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".&lt;ref&gt;Phillip (1947), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies.&lt;ref name="n264"&gt;Nash (2008), 264&lt;/ref&gt; Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. [[Charles V of France]] had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean de Berry]] owned 19, while [[Mary of Burgundy]], [[Isabella of Valois]], [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.&lt;ref name="n266"&gt;Nash (2008), 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapestry production began with design.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"&gt;Cavallo (1973), 21&lt;/ref&gt; The designs, or [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoons]] were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive.&lt;ref name="n209"&gt;Nash (2008), 209&lt;/ref&gt; Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt;

[[File:Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ.jpg|thumb|513px|Unknown Flemish weaver, ''Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ'', c.&amp;nbsp;1470–90. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]]
Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1973), 12&lt;/ref&gt; The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by [[Colart de Laon]]&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt; having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.&lt;ref name="n209" /&gt;

Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' resembles, "in its precise symbolism&amp;nbsp;... a medieval tapestry".&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triptychs and altarpieces===
Northern [[triptych]]s{{efn-ua|The word ''triptych'' did not exist during the era; the works were known as "paintings with doors". See Jacobs (2011), 8}} and [[polyptych]]s were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for [[liturgy|liturgical]] settings.&lt;ref name="j1009"&gt;Jacobs (2000), 1009&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.{{efn-ua|In 14th-century altarpieces the "nature of the subject" was most important; generally the more sacred the subject the more decorative and elaborate its treatment. See Huizinga (2009), 22}}&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt;

[[File:The Braque Triptych interior.jpg|thumb|560px|left|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Braque Triptych]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1452. Oil on oak panels. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This triptych is noted for the floating "speech" inscriptions, and for the landscape uniting the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 89&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels.&lt;ref name="t319"&gt;Toman (2011), 319&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.{{efn-ua|The work comprises 12 exterior and 14 interior painted panels, and the different possible combinations of panels produced different intended meanings. See Toman (2011), 319}}&lt;ref name="t319" /&gt;

The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2011), 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the [[Holy Family]]; early works, especially from the [[Siena|Sienese]] or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures.&lt;ref name="b116"&gt;Blum (1972), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and c.&amp;nbsp;1452 ''[[Braque Triptych]]''. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels.&lt;ref&gt;Acres (2000), 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs,{{efn-ua|Of which three are documented but lost, eight survive fully intact, and five exist in fragments. See Jacobs (2000), 1010}} the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.&lt;ref name="j1009" /&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpg|thumb|480px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Hermit Saints]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1493. [[Doge's Palace, Venice]]]]

Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400.&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt; Few of these very early examples survive,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35&lt;/ref&gt; but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. [[Till-Holger Borchert]] describes how they bestowed a "prestige which, in the first half of the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving".&lt;ref name="B52"&gt;Borchert (2011), 52&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of [[division of labour]].&lt;ref name="B52"/&gt;

Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-16th century. Later the [[iconoclasm]] of the Reformation deemed them offensive,&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name="b35"/&gt; As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings".&lt;ref name="c405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diptychs===
[[Diptych]]s were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame);&lt;ref name="p100"&gt;Pearson (2000), 100&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; Originating from conventions in [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]], diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces.&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Smith (2004), 144&lt;/ref&gt; Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side.&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"&gt;Smith (2004), 134&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval "treasury art" -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The [[tracery]] seen in works such as van der Weyden's ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child]]'' reflects ivory carving of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2006), 175&lt;/ref&gt; The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]],&lt;ref name="p99"&gt;Pearson (2000), 99&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by [[Hugo van der Goes]], Hans Memling and later [[Jan van Scorel]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt;

[[File:Seguace di dirck bouts, dittico con mater dolorosa e cristo coronato di spine, 1450-1500 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Dieric Bouts]], ''[[Mater Dolorosa]]/[[Ecce Homo]]'', after 1450, a rare surviving diptych with intact frame and hinges]]
Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child,&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 178&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt; – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the "place of honour" alongside the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin de Loo (1923), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the [[Devotio Moderna]] movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a "matter of small scale and meticulous detail". The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the "experience of miraculous visions".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998c), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.&lt;ref name="H16"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single "genre" pictures.&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.&lt;ref name="Borchert182ff"&gt;Borchert (2006), 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraiture===
[[File:Hugo van der Goes 007.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Hugo van der Goes]], ''Portrait of a Man'', c.&amp;nbsp;1480. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]

Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 225&lt;/ref&gt; While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"/&gt; Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer;&lt;ref&gt;Bauman (1986), 4&lt;/ref&gt; his seminal 1432 ''[[Léal Souvenir]]'' is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance.&lt;ref name = "Kemperdick19"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 19&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' is filled with symbolism,&lt;ref name ="Dhanens198"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 198&lt;/ref&gt; as is the ''Madonna of Chancelor Rolin'', commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.&lt;ref name ="Dhanens269"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Young Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Petrus Christus]], ''[[Portrait of a Young Girl (Christus)|Portrait of a Young Girl]]'', after 1460, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. One of the first portraits to present its sitter in a three-dimensional room. Many sources mention her enigmatic and complex expression, and petulant, reserved gaze.&lt;ref name="VDE69"&gt;Van der Elst (1944), 69&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 104–107&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1462 ''[[:commons:File:Bouts Portrait of a Man 1462.jpg|Portrait of a Man]]'', Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 23&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in [[fresco]] and illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="k26"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 26&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power.&lt;ref name="k28" /&gt; Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s positioning of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in front of a landscape view.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist [[Jean Fouquet]] and the Germans [[Hans Pleydenwurff]]&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 25&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Schongauer among others.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 277–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian [[Quattrocento]] – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"/&gt; The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's 1433 ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man]]'' is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"&gt;Smith (2004), 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential [[betrothal]]s, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer described the function of portraiture as "preserving a person's appearance after his death".&lt;ref&gt;''Awch behelt daz gemell dy gestalt der menschen nach jrem sterben'' See Rupprich, Hans (ed). "Dürer". ''Schriftlicher Nachlass'', Volume 3. Berlin, 1966. 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Dürer's father, a goldsmith, spent time as a journeyman in the Netherlands and met with, according to his son, "the great artists". Dürer himself travelled there between 1520 and 1521 and visited Bruges, Ghent and Brussels among other places. See Borchert (2011), 83}} Portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 95&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being [[:commons:File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|van Eyck's study]] for his ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]''.&lt;ref name="k28"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape===

Christ and thief before a view of Jerusalem, c.&amp;nbsp;1430. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. The Crucifixion panel in this diptych is framed within an azure sky against a distant view of [[Jerusalem]].]]
Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]. They were rarely based on actual locations;{{efn-ua|[[Konrad Witz]]'s ''[[The Miraculous Draft of Fishes (Witz)|Miraculous Draft of Fishes]]'' of 1444 is credited as the earliest extant faithful portrayal in European art history of a landscape based on observation of real topographical features. See Borchert (2011), 58}} the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes.&lt;ref name="h134"&gt;Harbison (1995), 134&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.&amp;nbsp;1430 ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]'' and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"/&gt;

Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the [[Labours of the Months]] landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the ''Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry''. The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], which show rich landscapes in the tiny ''bas de page'' scenes.&lt;ref name ="Pächt29"&gt;Pächt (1999), 29&lt;/ref&gt; These, according to Pächt, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting.&lt;ref name ="Pächt187"&gt;Pächt (1999), 187&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. [[Simon Bening]] "explored new territory in the genre of landscape", seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 ''[[Grimani|Grimani Breviary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 392&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 15th century, a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects.&lt;ref name="h60" /&gt; Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably [[Konrad Witz]] in the mid-15th century, and later [[Joachim Patinir]].&lt;ref name="h61"&gt;Harbison (1995), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from [[Haarlem]], [[Leiden]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.&lt;ref name="h134" /&gt;

Patinir developed what is now called the [[world landscape]] genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the [[Danube school]]. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 47&lt;/ref&gt; World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a [[long shot|long]] rather than a [[medium shot]]. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere [[staffage]]. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular subjects of this type include the [[Flight into Egypt]] and the plight of hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]]. As well as connecting the style to the later [[Age of Discovery]], the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Italian Renaissance==
[[File:Hugo van der Goes - Triptyque Portinari, détail 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hugo van der Goes]], detail from the ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1475. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The progressions in northern art developed almost simultaneously with the early [[Italian Renaissance]]. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, to the extent that many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north.&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"&gt;Toman (2011), 317&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, as can be seen in the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks.&lt;ref name="H3"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

While devotional paintings – especially altarpieces – remained dominant in Early Netherlandish art,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317" /&gt; secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and southern Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Toman (2011), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian influences on Netherlandish art are first apparent in the late 15th century, when some of the painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, "picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism".&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;Campbell (1998), 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Memling 061.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Hans Memling, ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels'', c. 1480. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedländer they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with.&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; However, Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together – "that elegant harmony and grace&amp;nbsp;... which is called beauty", evident, for example, in [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[:File:Andrea Mantegna - The Dead Christ.jpg|Entombment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 16th century, the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north-south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 35&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows.{{efn-ua|Described by Panofsky as "the interior viewed through a triple arcade".  See Panofsky (1969), 142}}&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 142–3&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', in Florence's [[Uffizi]], played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like [[Giovanni Bellini]] came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels''. By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; [[Michelangelo]] claimed it was appealing only to "monks and friars".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 58&lt;/ref&gt; At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy. By the 17th century, when Bruges had lost its prestige and position as the pre-eminent European trading city (the rivers silted and ports were forced to close), the Italians dominated European art.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction and dispersal==

===Iconoclasm===
[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|330px|Print of the destruction in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], the "signature event" of the [[Beeldenstorm]], August 20, 1566, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;analysed in Arnade, 146 (quoted); see also [http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/155/index.html Art through time]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially [[idolatrous]] from the start of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. [[Martin Luther]] accepted some imagery, but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria. [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] were wholly opposed to public religious images, above all in churches, and [[Calvinism]] soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism. From 1520, outbursts of reformist [[iconoclasm]] broke out across much of Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="sn15"&gt;Nash (2008), 15&lt;/ref&gt; These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]] and the [[English Commonwealth]], or unofficial and often violent, as in the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' or "Iconoclastic Fury" in 1566 in the Netherlands.  On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where [[Marcus van Vaernewijck]]  chronicled the events. He wrote of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' being "taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;Van Vaernewijck (1905–6), 132&lt;/ref&gt;  Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566,&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 133–148&lt;/ref&gt; followed by more losses in the Spanish [[Sack of Antwerp]] in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes,&lt;ref name="sn14"&gt;Nash (2008), 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the period's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"/&gt; with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's ''Madonna in the Church'' and van der Weyden's ''[[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden and workshop - Exhumation of St Hubert NG 783.jpg|Exhumation of St Hubert]]''.  According to Nash, van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, "any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes". Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time.&lt;ref name="sn14" /&gt; Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. It was destroyed by French artillery during the [[bombardment of Brussels]] in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===
There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "n21"&gt;Nash (2008), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters, such as [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] and [[Ambrosius Benson]] of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.&lt;ref name="A36"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed.&lt;ref name = "n21"/&gt; The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded.&lt;ref name="n22"&gt;Nash (2008), 22&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s,&lt;ref name="n123"&gt;Nash (2008), 123&lt;/ref&gt; and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them.&lt;ref name="n44"&gt;Nash (2008), 44&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.&lt;ref name="n39"&gt;Nash (2008), 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Jan van Eyck's life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period's innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling,&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 8&lt;/ref&gt; while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by "names of convenience", usually of the "Master of&amp;nbsp;..." format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the "notname" term is often used, a derivative of a German term.{{efn-ua|Typically pseudonyms are applied after common elements are established among a group of works. Art historians consider similarities of theme, style, iconography, biblical source and physical location before attributing work to an individual or workshop, then assign a generic name.}} Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences.&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="Pächt9716"&gt;Pächt (1997), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, "much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied".&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called [[Master of the Legend of the Magdalen]], who may have been [[Pieter van Coninxloo]], is one of the more notable examples;&lt;ref name="Campbell114"/&gt; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by [[Lucas de Heere]] in 1565 and [[Karel van Mander]] in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriacus Ancona]] in 1449, [[Bartolomeo Facio]] in 1456, and [[Giovanni Santi]] in 1482.&lt;ref name="sn24"&gt;Nash (2008), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
The dominance of Northern [[Mannerism]] in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c.&amp;nbsp;1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 411–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When [[The Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] was converted to an art gallery during the [[French Revolution]], Gerard David's ''Marriage at Cana'' – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French [[Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars|conquered the Low Countries]].{{efn-ua|The central panels of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', van Eyck's ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'', and Memling's ''Morel Triptych''}} These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Karl Schlegel]], who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to [[Ludwig Tieck]], who had the piece published in 1805.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The marriage at cana1 wga.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Gerard David, ''Marriage at Cana'', c.&amp;nbsp;1500. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This work was first publicly displayed in 1802, attributed to van Eyck. Art historians in the 19th century were preoccupied with the difficulties of attribution.]]

In 1821 [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée]] in Heidelberg.{{efn-ua|The Boisserée collection was acquired in 1827, on the advice of [[Johann Georg von Dillis]], to form part of the nucleus of the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich. See Ridderbos (2005), 86}} Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), viii&lt;/ref&gt; She published ''Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger'' in 1822, the same year [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, ''Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck'';&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 219–224&lt;/ref&gt; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the ''Ghent'' panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"/&gt;

In 1830 the [[Belgian Revolution]] split Belgium from the Netherlands of today; as the newly created state sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling's reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master's match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 413–416&lt;/ref&gt;  When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of [[House of Oettingen-Wallerstein|Oettingen-Wallerstein]] at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] arranged a viewing at [[Kensington Palace]]; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself.&lt;ref&gt;Steegman, John (1950). ''Consort of Taste'', excerpted in Frank Herrmann, ''The English as Collectors'', 240; Queen Victoria donated the best of them to the National Gallery after the Prince Consort's death.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collectors/prince-albert-and-the-gallery Prince Albert and the Gallery]". ''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At a period when London's [[National Gallery]] sought to increase its prestige,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] purchased Rogier van der Weyden's ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'' panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin's "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|exhibition of Netherlandish art]] with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a "turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art".&lt;ref name="Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275"&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling's pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. [[Johan Huizinga]] was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 284&lt;/ref&gt; Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship and conservation==
[[File:Ghent altarpiece at Altaussee.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' during recovery from the [[Altaussee]] salt mine at the end of World War II. The pioneering [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] work on these panels in the 1950s led to advances in methodology and technical application&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13" /&gt;]]
The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]]'s pioneering ''Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts''. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian renaissance]].&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gent-CatedralStBavon-Poliptic-vanEyck-1765sh.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''Ghent Altarpiece'' during technical analysis in [[Saint Bavo's Cathedral]]]]
Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon [[Formalism (art)|formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Holly (1985), 9&lt;/ref&gt; He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography.&lt;ref name="r248" /&gt; Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="k177"&gt;Kren (2010), 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Pächt and [[Friedrich Winkler]] continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience.&lt;ref name="k177" /&gt; The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and [[Meyer Schapiro]], that the attributions generally accepted today were established.&lt;ref name="Campbell114"&gt;Campbell (1998), 114&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In the 1960s and 1970s [[Lotte Brand Philip]] and [[Elisabeth Dhanens]] built on Panofsky's work, and resolved many of the issues that Panofsky had struggled with, especially in relation to identifying the sources of iconography, and attributing works of the early to mid-15th century.}}

[[File:Hôtel-Dieu de Beaune 111.JPG|thumb|left|Van der Weyden's ''[[Beaune Altarpiece]]'' held under low light and with the panels split so that both sides can be displayed simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 74&lt;/ref&gt;]]
More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters.&lt;ref name="Umass"/&gt; The conservation of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"/&gt;

Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time.&lt;ref name="Umass"&gt;"[http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm Craig Harbison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605061635/http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}". [[University of Massachusetts]]. Retrieved 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Craig Harbison]], "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were."&lt;ref name="BuchholZ"&gt;Buchholz, Sarah R. "[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/04-14/harbison28.html A Picture Worth Many Thousand Words]". ''Chronicle'', University of Massachusetts, 14 April 2000. Retrieved 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a "prayer book mentality" available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5582">'''EcoPark''' ({{zh|t=環保園}}) located in [[Tuen Mun]] Area 38, on west side of [[Hong Kong]], is similar to an [[industrial park]] exclusively for [[waste recycling]] and [[environmental engineering]].  This is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

== Introduction ==
In December 2003, the [[Hong Kong Government]] mapped out a strategy on waste management emphasized waste reduction and recovery. Hong Kong currently recycles 48% of its [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), but over 99% of recovered recyclable materials are exported to [[Mainland China]] for further re-processing while less than 1% are treated locally and re-manufactured into useful products. With the measures to promote waste recovery, recycling and reuse in place, a local waste management area like EcoPark is a viable option for furthering Hong Kong's recycling program.  

EcoPark aims to promote the local [[recycling|recycling industry]] and jump-start a circular economy to provide a sustainable solution to the city's waste problems. By encouraging and promoting the reuse, recovery and recycling of waste resources and returning them to the consumption loop, the EcoPark will help realize the full potential of the local recycling industry and alleviate the heavy reliance on the export of recyclable materials recovered from Hong Kong.

== Design and construction ==
The EcoPark occupies 200,000 square metres of land in Tuen Mun Area 38 and will be developed in two phases. As pledged in the Policy Framework, the aim is to commission Phase I of EcoPark (80,000 square metres) towards the end of 2006 and Phase II (120,000 square metres) in 2009. Hong Kong Government funding will be used to build the basic infrastructure of EcoPark.

The EcoPark will be divided into lots of different sizes. Lots in EcoPark will be tendered for specific recovered materials and processes that help achieve Hong Kong's government waste management objectives, in particular, in recycling local wastes. Admission criteria will be developed with priority given to processes involving value-added technologies, and target materials of the proposed Producer Responsibility Schemes. 

== Progress ==
All six lots in EcoPark Phase I has been allocated for recycling of waste cooking oil, waste computer equipment, waste metals, waste wood, waste plastics and waste car batteries.  Some of them are already in operation, while the rest of tenants will start their operation shortly.

Construction works of the EcoPark Phase II have already completed.  Two lots have been allocated to non-government organisations for recycling of plastics and waste electrical appliances.  The remaining lots in EcoPark Phase II will be available for tendering in late 2010.  

== Phase I tenants ==

== Phase II lots ==
Tendering of Phase II lots (with a total area of 100,000 square metres) will start in late 2010.  Further information on the tendering can be obtained from EcoPark management office.

== Visitor Centre ==
The 1,000-square metre EcoPark Visitor Centre is the first education centre in Hong Kong with a main theme of solid waste management.  Admission is free and docent service will be provided.  Online and telephone booking can be arranged through the EcoPark Management Office. 

== Public consultation ==
Hong Kong Government has consulted the [[Tuen Mun District|Tuen Mun District Council]] and members support the development of EcoPark and agree that EcoPark will help promote development of local recycling industry and create job opportunities in Tuen Mun. The Council hopes that EcoPark will become a landmark for Tuen Mun.

Local trade associations and recyclers were also consulted and they support the development of EcoPark, agreeing that by providing long-term land at affordable cost, together with supporting infrastructure, EcoPark will help enhance recycling technology development and improve waste recovery rates in Hong Kong.

== Environmental considerations ==
An [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) was carried out in respect of air and water quality, waste management, land contamination, [[landfill gas]] hazard and hazard to life, in which a wide range of recycling processes for different material types were examined. The assessment recommends a list of materials and processes to be allowed and also recommends a number of mitigation measures. With these measures in place, the EIA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impacts to the surrounding areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76611">'''Embodied cognition''' is the theory that many features of [[cognition]], whether human or otherwise, are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. The features of cognition include high level mental constructs (such as [[concept]]s and [[Categorization|categories]]) and performance on various cognitive tasks (such as reasoning or judgment). The aspects of the body include the [[motor system]], the [[perceptual system]], bodily interactions with the environment ([[situated]]ness) and the assumptions about the world that are built into the structure of the organism.

The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is closely related to the [[extended mind thesis]], [[situated cognition]] and [[enactivism]]. The modern version depends on insights drawn from recent research in [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], [[animal cognition]], [[plant cognition]] and [[neurobiology]].

==Embodiment thesis==
In [[philosophy]], embodied cognition holds that an agent's [[cognition]] is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/  |date=July 25, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In their proposal for an [[Enactivism|enactive approach]] to cognition Varela ''et al.'' defined "embodied":&lt;ref name=VarelaF&gt;
{{cite book |title=The embodied mind: Cognitive science and human experience |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4RoH2z5DoC&amp;pg=PA172 |isbn=978-0262720212 |edition=Paperback 1992 |author1=Eleanor Rosch |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Francisco J. Varela }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By using the term ''embodied'' we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context."
:::—  Eleanor Rosch, Evan Thompson, Francisco J. Varela: ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'' pages 172–173

The Varela enactive definition is broad enough to overlap the views of [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]], and indeed, these ideas are not always carefully separated.

Some authors explain the dependence of cognition upon the body and its environmental interactions by saying cognition in real biological systems is not an end in itself but is constrained by the system's goals and capacities. However, they argue, such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior (or [[autopoiesis]]) alone, but cognition requires “''some'' kind of information processing...the transformation or communication of incoming information”, the acquiring of which involves "exploration and modification of the environment".&lt;ref name= Milkowski&gt;
{{cite book |title=Explaining the Computational Mind |author= Marcin Milkowski |page=4 |isbn=9780262018869 |year=2013 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxH7eOEmlC4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22transformation+or+communication+of+incoming+information%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BRvuVMa3D4urogSNo4CoBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transformation%20or%20communication%20of%20incoming%20information%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that cognition consists simply of building maximally accurate representations of input information...the gaining of knowledge is a stepping stone to achieving the more immediate goal of guiding behavior in response to the system's changing surroundings."
:::— Marcin Miłkowski: ''Explaining the Computational Mind'', p. 4

The separation of embodied cognition from [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]] can be based upon the ''embodiment thesis'', a narrower view of embodiment than that of Varela ''et al.'' or that of Dawson:&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;
:'''''Embodiment thesis:''''' Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent, such that the agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that agent's cognitive processing. 
:::—RA Wilson and L Foglia,  ''Embodied Cognition'' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

This thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the "more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context" included by Varela ''et al.'' The [[Extended mind thesis|''&lt;u&gt;Extended&lt;/u&gt;'' mind thesis]], in contrast with the &lt;u&gt;''Embodiment''&lt;/u&gt; thesis, limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body, but extends it outward into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;
{{cite web |title=The Extended Mind |work=Philosophy of the mind |publisher=philpapers: philosophical research on line |url=http://philpapers.org/browse/the-extended-mind |accessdate=February 2015 |editor= David Chalmers}} See also: {{cite book |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxQNhOS8VjQC&amp;pg=PA27 |pages=27 ''ff'' |title=The extended mind |editor=Richard Menary |isbn=9780262014038 |year=2010 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''&lt;u&gt;Situated&lt;/u&gt;'' cognition emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head, but stresses the role of probing and modifying interaction with the agent's world.&lt;ref name=ClarkA&gt;
{{cite book |author=Andy Clark |title=Supersizing the Mind : Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension |isbn=9780199715534 |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |quote=no genuinely cognitive system will turn out to consist ''entirely'' of the kind of external resources that fans of extended cognition typically invoke |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cgwUvk3OiIC&amp;pg=PA107}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical background ==

In his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven]]'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', p.367; translated by Stephen Palmquist in [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p.320.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] advocated a view of the [[mind–body problem]] and the [[subject–object problem]] with parallels to the embodied view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Andrew Carpenter |title= Kant on the embodied cognition |url=http://journals.ut.ac.ir/pdf_28259_26f2aefa9b23b767d721f1e94459c224.html |journal= فلسفه |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=59–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some difficulties with this interpretation of Kant include (i) the view that Kant holds the empirical, and specifically knowledge of the body, cannot support ''a priori'' transcendental claims,&lt;ref name=RoschE&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience |author1=Eleanor Rosch |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Francisco J.

&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) the view that Kant holds that transcendental philosophy, although charged with the responsibility of explaining how we can have empirical knowledge, is not itself empirical.&lt;ref name= SvareH&gt;
{{cite book |title=Body and Practice in Kant |author= Helge Svare |chapter=Chapter 7: The body and the transcendental |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAsCcVhy-IIC&amp;pg=PA213 |pages= 213 ''ff'' |isbn=9781402041198 |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[George Santayana]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and others in the broadly [[Existentialism|existential]] tradition have proposed philosophies of mind influencing the development of the modern 'embodiment' thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cowart, Monica 2004 Embodied Cognition
The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/], retrieved 27 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodiment movement in [[artificial intelligence]] has fueled the embodiment argument in philosophy and a revised view of [[ethology]]:&lt;ref name=Hendriks&gt;{{cite book |author= Horst Hendriks-Jansen |year=1996 |title=Catching Ourselves in the Act: Situated Activity, Interactive Emergence, Evolution, and Human Thought |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262082464 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PzBEBFMFvAC&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Species-typical activity patterns must be thought of as emergent phenomena in three different senses of the word. They have emerged...through natural selection, ....by a process of maturation and/or learning, ...and from interactions between the creature's low-level activities and its species-typical environment."
:::—Horst Hendriks-Jansen   ''Catching Ourselves in the Act'', p. 10

These developments have also given emotions a new status in [[philosophy of mind]] as an indispensable constituent, rather than a non-essential addition to rational intellectual thought.
In philosophy of mind, the idea that cognition is embodied is sympathetic with other views of cognition such as [[situated cognition]] or [[externalism]]. This is a radical move towards a total re-localization of mental processes out of the neural domain.&lt;ref&gt;Di Paolo, Ezequiel

==Connections with the sciences==

Embodied cognition is a topic of research in [[social psychology|social]] and [[cognitive psychology]], covering issues such as [[social interaction]] and [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borghi|first1=Anna M.|last2=Cimatti|first2=Felice|title=Embodied cognition and beyond: Acting and sensing the body|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=3|year=2010|pages=763–773|issn=0028-3932|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.029|pmid=19913041}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Embodied cognition reflects the argument that the [[motor system]] influences our cognition, just as the mind influences bodily actions.  For example, when participants hold a pencil in their teeth engaging the muscles of a smile, they comprehend pleasant sentences faster than unpleasant ones, while holding a pencil between their nose and upper lip to engage the muscles of a frown has the reverse effect.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al."&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diane Pecher|author2=Rolf A. Zwaan|title=Grounding Cognition: The Role of Perception and Action in Memory, Language, and Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaxTkckBnh4C&amp;pg=PA115|date=10 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44247-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lakoff]] (a [[cognitive scientist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]]) and his collaborators (including [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]]) have written a series of books promoting and expanding the thesis based on discoveries in [[cognitive science]], such as [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[image schema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|1987}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Lakoff|Nunez|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robotic]]s researchers such as [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Rolf Pfeifer]] have argued that true [[artificial intelligence]] can only be achieved by machines that have [[Sensory perception|sensory]] and [[motor skills]] and are connected to the world through a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}, {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insights of these robotics researchers have in turn inspired philosophers like [[Andy Clark]] and [[Horst Hendriks-Jansen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1997}}, {{Harvnb|Hendriks-Jansen|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiology|Neuroscientist]]s [[Gerald Edelman]], [[António Damásio]] and others have outlined the connection between the body, individual structures in the brain and aspects of the mind such as [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[self-awareness]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edelman|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Damasio|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biology]] has also inspired [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[Evan Thompson]] to develop a closely related version of the idea, which they call [[enactivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maturana|Varela|1987}}, {{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[motor theory of speech perception]] proposed by [[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues at the [[Haskins Laboratories]] argues that the identification of words is embodied in perception of the bodily movements by which spoken words are made.&lt;ref name="Liberman67"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4170865|year=1967|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Cooper|first2=FS|last3=Shankweiler|first3=DP|last4=Studdert-Kennedy|first4=M|title=Perception of the speech code|volume=74|issue=6|pages=431–61|journal=Psychological Review|ref=harv|doi=10.1037/h0020279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4075760|year=1985|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=The motor theory of speech perception revised|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–36|journal=Cognition|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2643163|year=1989|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=A specialization for speech perception|volume=243|issue=4890|pages=489–94|journal=Science|ref=harv|doi=10.1126/science.2643163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberman00"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10782105|year=2000|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Whalen|first2=DH|title=On the relation of speech to language|volume=4|issue=5|pages=187–196|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galantucci"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17048719|year=2006|last1=Galantucci|first1=B|last2=Fowler|first2=CA|last3=Turvey|first3=MT|title=The motor theory of speech perception reviewed|volume=13|issue=3|pages=361–77|pmc=2746041|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|ref=harv|doi=10.3758/bf03193857}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In related work at Haskins, Paul Mermelstein, [[Philip Rubin]], [[Louis M. Goldstein|Louis Goldstein]], and colleagues developed [[articulatory synthesis]] tools for computationally modeling the physiology and aeroacoustics of the [[vocal tract]], demonstrating how cognition and perception of speech can be shaped by biological constraints. This was extended into the audio-visual domain by the "talking heads" approach of Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Rubin, and other colleagues.

One embodied cognition study shows that action [[intention]] can affect processing in [[visual search]], with more orientation errors for pointing than for grasping.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekkering H, Neggers SF |title=Visual search is modulated by action intentions |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=370–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12137141 |doi= 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00466.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants either pointed to or grasped target objects of 2 colors and 2 orientations (45° and 135°).  There were randomized numbers of distractors as well (0, 3, 6, or 9), which differed from the target in color, orientation, or both.  A tone sounded to inform participants which target orientation to find.  Participants kept their eyes on a fixation point until it turned from red to the target color.  The screen then lit up and the participants searched for the target, either pointing to it or grasping it (depending on the block).  There were 2 blocks for pointing and 2 for grasping, with the order counterbalanced.  Each block had 64 trials.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

Results from the experiment show that accuracy decreases with an increase in the number of distractors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Overall, participants made more orientation errors than color errors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  There was no main effect of [[accuracy]] between the pointing and grasping conditions, but participants made significantly fewer orientation errors in the grasping condition than in the pointing condition.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Color errors were the same in both conditions.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Because orientation is important in grasping an object, these results fit with the researchers' hypothesis that the plan to grasp an object will aid in orientation accuracy.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition because action intention (planning to grasp an object) can affect visual processing of task-relevant information (orientation).&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

===Distance perception===

Internal states can affect distance [[perception]], which relates to embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Balcetis E, Dunning D |title=Cognitive dissonance and the perception of natural environments |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=917–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17894610 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02000.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers randomly assigned college student participants to high-choice, low-choice, and control conditions. The high-choice condition signed a “freedom of choice” consent form indicating their decision to wear a [[Carmen Miranda]] costume and walk across a busy area of campus.  Low-choice participants signed an “experimenter choice” consent form, indicating the experimenter assigned the participant to wear the costume.  A control group walked across campus but did not wear a costume.  At the conclusion of the experiment, each participant completed a survey which asked them to estimate the distance they walked.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"/&gt;

The high-choice participants perceived the distance walked as significantly shorter than participants in the low-choice and control groups, even though they walked the same distance.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  The manipulation caused high-choice participants to feel responsible for the choice to walk in the embarrassing costume.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  This created [[cognitive dissonance]], which refers to a discrepancy between [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  High-choice participants reconciled their thoughts and actions by perceiving the distance as shorter.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  These results show the ability of internal states to affect perception of physical distance moved, which illustrates the reciprocal relationship of the body and mind in embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Perspective===
[[File:Tversky and Hard figure.png|thumb|250px|Graph depicting the percentage of responses by perspective for each photograph condition.]]  
Researchers have found that when making judgements about objects in photographs, people will take the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of a person in the picture instead of their own.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Barbara|last2=Hard|first2=Bridgette Martin|title=Embodied and disembodied cognition: Spatial perspective-taking|journal=Cognition|volume=110|issue=1|year=2009|pages=124–129|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.008|pmid=19056081}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They showed college undergraduate participants 1 of 3 photographs and asked where 1 object in the picture was compared to the other object.  For example, if the 2 objects were an apple and a banana, the participants would have to respond to a question about the location of the apple compared to the banana. The photographs either had no person, a person looking at the object, in this case the banana, or a person reaching for the banana. The photograph and question appeared in a larger set of questionnaires not related to the study.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

Results show that participants who viewed photographs that included a person were significantly more likely to respond from another's perspective than those who saw photographs with no person.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  There were no differences in perspective of responses for the person looking versus reaching.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  Participants who saw the scene without a person were significantly more likely to respond from their own perspective.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  This means that the presence of a person in the photograph affected the perspective used even though the question focused solely on the two objects.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  The researchers state that these results suggest ''disembodied'' cognition, in which the participants put themselves into the body of the person in the photograph.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

===Language comprehension===
{{See also|Embodied language processing}}
Some researchers [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|extend embodied cognition to include language]].&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt; They describe language as a tool that aids in broadening our sense of body.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  For instance, when asked to identify “this” object, participants most often choose an object near to them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Conversely, when asked to identify “that” object, participants choose an object further away from them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Language allows us to distinguish between distances in more complex ways than the simple perceptual difference between near and far objects.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;

[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|thumb|250px|The change in "relative phase shift" for different conditions in the study. Participants had a significantly larger change for "performable" sentences than "inanimate" sentences and swinging only.]]
The motor system is involved in [[language]] comprehension, in this case when sentences were performable by a human, there was a change in participants' overall movement of a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olmstead AJ, Viswanathan N, Aicher KA, Fowler CA |title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: implications for embodied cognition |journal=Q J Exp Psychol (Hove) |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2409–17 |year=2009 |pmid=19396732 |doi=10.1080/17470210902846765 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed an experiment in which college undergraduate participants swung a pendulum while completing a "sentence judgement task."  Participants would swing the pendulum with both hands for 10 seconds before a prompt and then a sentence would appear on the screen until the participant responded.  In the control condition, participants swung the pendulum without performing the "sentence judgement task."  Each trial had half "plausible" and half "implausible" sentences.  The "plausible" sentences made sense semantically, while the "implausible" ones did not.  The "performable" sentences could be performed by a human, while the "inanimate" sentences could not.  Participants responded by saying "yes" to the "plausible" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Results show a significant "relative phase shift," or overall change in movement of the swinging pendulum, for the "performable" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  This change did not occur for "inanimate" sentences or the control condition.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers did not expect an overall phase shift, instead they expected a change in the variability of movement, or the "[[standard deviation]] of relative phase shift."&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  Although not entirely expected, these results support embodied cognition and show that the motor system is involved in the understanding of language.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers suggest that the nature of this relationship needs to be further studied to determine the exact [[correlation]] this task has to bi-manual motor movements.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Embodiment effects emerge in the way in which people of different sex and temperament perceive verbal material, such as common adjectives and abstract and neutral nouns. Trofimova, who first described this phenomenon in her experiments, called it "projection through capacities". This phenomenon emerges when people's lexical perception depends upon their capacities to handle the events; when their information processing registers mostly those aspects of objects or of a situation that they can properly react to and deal with according to their inherent capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=1999|title=How people of different age sex and temperament estimate the world.|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=85/2|pages=533–552|doi=10.2466/pr0.1999.85.2.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2012|title=Understanding misunderstanding: a study of sex differences in meaning attribution.|journal= Psychological Research|volume=77 | issue = 6 |pages=748–760|DOI=10.1007/s00426-012-0462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2014|title=Observer bias: an interaction of temperament traits with biases in the semantic perception of lexical material.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9 | issue = 1 |pages=e85677.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677|pmid=24475048|pmc=3903487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, in these studies males with stronger motor-physical endurance estimated abstractions describing people-, work/reality- and time-related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance. Females with stronger social or physical endurance estimated social attractors in more positive terms than weaker females. Both male and female temperament groups with higher sociability showed a universal positive bias in their estimations of neutral words, especially for social and work/reality-related concepts, in comparison to participants with lower sociability. Capacities related to the tempo of activities also appeared to impact the perception of lexical material: men with faster motor-physical tempo estimated neutral, abstract time-related concepts significantly in more positive terms than men with slower tempo.

===Memory===

A study examining [[memory]] and embodied cognition illustrates that people remember more of the gist of a story when they physically act it out.&lt;ref name="Scott et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Christina L.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard Jackson|last3=Rothe|first3=Alicia R.|title=Embodied Cognition Through Improvisation Improves Memory for a Dramatic Monologue|journal=Discourse Processes|volume=31|issue=3|year=2001|pages=293–305|issn=0163-853X|doi=10.1207/S15326950dp31-3_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were "Read Only," "Writing," "Collaborative Discussion," "Independent Discussion," and "[[Improvisation]]."  All participants received a [[monologue]] about teen addiction and were told to pay attention to details about the character and action in the monologue.  Participants were given 5 minutes to read the monologue twice, unaware of a future recall test.  In the "Read Only" condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading the monologue.  In the "Writing" condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story from the perspective of the character in the monologue.  They had 6 minutes to answer each question.  In the "Collaborative Discussion" condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the "Writing" group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women.  They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question.  The "Independent Discussion" condition was the same as the "Collaborative Discussion," except 1 person answered each question.  In the "Improvisation" condition participants acted out 5 scenes from the monologue in groups of 5 women.  The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for the monologue.  Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once.  Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test.  Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations.  The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing.  Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

Researchers gave the recall test to a group who did not read the monologue.  They scored significantly lower than the other groups, which indicated that guessing was not easy.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  In coding the answers to the recall test, exact words were labeled "Verbatim", and correct content but varied wording was labeled "Gist".  The combination of "Verbatim" and "Gist" was called "Total Memory."  The "Improvisational" group had more "Gist" memories than any other group and had more "Total Memory" than both of the discussion groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  The results fit the researchers' hypothesis that the "Improvisational" group would remember more because they actively rehearsed the information from the monologue.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Although other groups had also elaborately encoded the information, the "Improvisation" group remembered significantly more than the discussion groups and marginally more than the "Reading Only" and "Writing" groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Simply experiencing the monologue in an active way aids in remembering the "Gist."&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  There were no differences across groups for "Verbatim" memory, which they suggest could take longer than the limited time during the experiment to develop.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

===Learning===

Ideas stemming from embodied cognition research have been applied to the field of learning. It has been shown that bodily activity can be used to enhance learning in several studies.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Embodied learning: introducing a taxonomy based on bodily engagement and task integration |journal=Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1186/s41235-018-0092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on embodied learning often utilizes educational technology in the form of virtual reality, mixed reality, or motion caputure to transform learning activities into immersive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindgren |first1=Robb |last2=Johnson-Glenberg |first2=Mina |title=Emboldened by Embodiment |journal=Educational Researcher |date=November 2013 |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=445–452 |doi=10.3102/0013189X13511661}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are theoretical approaches that define the level of embodiment of these learning platforms based on factors such as their capabilities for immersion and sensorimotor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Glenberg |first1=Mina C. |last2=Birchfield |first2=David A. |last3=Tolentino |first3=Lisa |last4=Koziupa |first4=Tatyana |title=Collaborative embodied learning in mixed reality motion-capture environments: Two science studies. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=2014 |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |doi=10.1037/a0034008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical systems analyze embodied learning in terms of the degree of bodily engagement and whether the embodiment is integrated into a learning task.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey" /&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 354–359 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach and avoidance===
[[File:Van Dantzig et al. table.png|thumb|250px|Table showing response times for the positive, negative, and neutral valence conditions in the approach and avoidance experiment. Participants were significantly faster for the "positive toward" condition regardless of the central word's valence.]]
In research focused on the approach and avoidance effect, people showed an approach effect for positive words.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=Saskia van|last2=Zeelenberg|first2=René|last3=Pecher|first3=Diane|title=Unconstraining theories of embodied cognition|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=2|year=2009|pages=345–351|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "positive toward condition," participants moved positive words toward the center of the screen and negative words away.  In the "negative toward condition," participants moved negative words toward the center and positive words away.  Participants were given feedback about their accuracy at the end of each of the 4 experimental blocks.  In the first experiment the word at the center of the screen had a positive [[valence (psychology)|valence]], while in the second experiment the central word had a negative valence.  In the third experiment, the center of the screen had an empty box.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As predicted, in the first experiment participants in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster than those in the "negative toward condition."&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  This fits the approach/avoidance effect in embodied cognition, which states that people are faster to approach positive things and avoid negative ones.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In the second experiment, researchers expected participants in the "negative toward condition" to be faster, yet those in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Although effects were smaller in the third experiment, participants in the "positive toward condition" were still faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Overall, people were faster in the "positive toward condition," regardless of the valence of the central word.  Despite mixed results regarding the researchers' expectations, they maintain that the motor system is important in processing higher level representations such as the action goal.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In this study, participants showed strong approach effects in the "positive toward condition," which supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As part of a larger study, researchers separated participants into 5 groups with different instructions.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Labroo|first1=Aparna A.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Jesper H.|title=Half the Thrill Is in the Chase: Twisted Inferences from Embodied Cognitions and Brand Evaluation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=1|year=2010|pages=143–158|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/649908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "approach" condition, participants were instructed to imagine physically moving the product toward them, but in the "avoid" condition, participants had to imagine moving the product away from them.  In the "control" condition, participants were instructed to simply observe the product.  The "correction" condition involved the same instructions as the approach condition, except participants were told that the body can affect judgment.  In the "approach information" condition, participants had to list 5 reasons why they would obtain the product.  After viewing a picture of an aversive product, participants rated on a scale of 1 to 7 how desirable the product was and how much they approached of or avoided the product.  They also provided how much they would pay for the product.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

An approach/avoidance effect was found in relation to product evaluation.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  Participants in the "approach" condition liked the aversive product significantly more and would pay more for it.  There were no differences between the "avoidance," "control," "correction," and "approach information" conditions.  Simulation of approach can affect liking and willingness to pay for a product, but the effect can be reversed if the person knows about this influence.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

===Self-regulation===

As part of a larger study, one experiment randomly assigned college undergraduates to 2 groups.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hung|first1=Iris W.|last2=Labroo|first2=Aparna A.|title=From Firm Muscles to Firm Willpower: Understanding the Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=6|year=2011|pages=1046–1064|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/657240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "muscle-firming" condition participants grasped a pen in their hand, while in the "control" condition participants held the pen in their fingers.  The participants were then asked to fill out donations to [[Haiti]] for the [[Red Cross]] in sealed envelopes.  They were told to return the envelope regardless of whether they donated.  They also filled out questionnaires about their feelings about the Red Cross, their tendency to donate, their feelings about Haiti, what they thought the purpose of the study was, etc.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Significantly more participants in the "muscle-firming" condition than in the "control" condition donated money.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;  Condition did not affect the actual amount donated when participants chose to donate.  As the researchers predicted, the "muscle-firming" condition helped participants get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spend money.  Muscle-firming in this experiment may also be related to an increase in self-control, suggesting embodied cognition can play a role in self-regulation.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Another set of studies was conducted by Shalev (2014), indicating that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness-related cues influence perceived energy and reduce self-regulation. In Study 1, participants primed with dryness-related concepts reported greater physical thirst and tiredness and lower subjective vitality. In Study 2, participants who were physically thirstywere less persistent in investing effort in an unsolvable anagram task. In Study 3, images of arid land influenced time preference regarding when to begin preparation to make a monetary investment. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b, exposure to the names of dryness-related products influenced impressions of the vitality of a target person.&lt;ref name="Shalev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shalev|first=I.|title=Implicit Energy Loss: Embodied Dryness Cues Influence Vitality and Depletion|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|year=2014|volume=24|pages=260–270|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2013.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self-regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balcetis|first1=Emily|last2=Cole|first2=Shana|author-link1=Emily Balcetis|title=Body in Mind: The Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=3|issue=5|year=2009|pages=759–774|issn=1751-9004|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the embodied mind has a facilitative effect.  Some judgments, such as the emotion of a face, are detected more quickly when a participant mimics the facial expression that is being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Individuals holding a pen in their mouths to freeze their facial muscles and make them unable to mimic the expression were less able to judge emotions.  Goal-relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition, as evidenced by the automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation.  If one moves in a way previously associated with danger, the body may require a greater level of [[information processing]] than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"/&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Embodied Rapport.png|thumb|500px|Results from the social embodied cognition study that illustrate the relationship between positive emotions, observed behavioral synchrony, and embodied rapport.]]
Some social psychologists examined embodied cognition and hypothesized that embodied cognition would be supported by embodied rapport.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vacharkulksemsuk T, Fredrickson BL |title=Strangers in sync: Achieving embodied rapport through shared movements |journal=J Exp Soc Psychol |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=399–402 |year=2012 |pmid=22389521 |pmc=3290409 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.07.015 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied rapport would be demonstrated by pairs of same-sex strangers using Aron’s paradigm, which instructs participants to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose.  The researchers predicted that participants would mimic each other’s movements, reflecting embodied cognition.  Half the participants completed a control task of reading and editing a scientific article, while half the participants completed a shortened version of Aron’s [[self-disclosure]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

There is a significant correlation between self-disclosure and positive emotions towards the other participant.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Participants randomly assigned to the self-disclosure task displayed more [[behavioral synchrony]] (rated by independent judges watching the tapes of each condition on mute) and reported more positive emotions than the control group.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Since bodily movements influence the psychological experience of the task, the relationship between self-disclosure and positive feelings towards one's partner may be an example of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Evolutionary view ===

Embodied cognition may also be defined from the perspective of [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaschak|first1=Michael P.|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.|last3=Miller|first3=Saul|last4=Coyle|first4=Jacqueline M.|title=Embodied social cognition: Bodies, emotions, and blackberries|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1255–1256|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.692}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evolutionary psychologists view emotion as an important [[Homeostasis|self-regulatory]] aspect of embodied cognition, and [[Motivated reasoning|emotion as a motivator]] towards [[Goal setting|goal-relevant action]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt; Emotion helps drive [[adaptive behavior]].  The evolutionary perspective cites language, both spoken and written, as types of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt;  [[Diction|Pacing]] and [[non-verbal communication]] reflect embodied cognition in spoken language.  Technical aspects of written language, such as [[italics]], [[all caps]], and [[emoticons]] promote an [[Internal monologue|inner voice]] and thereby a sense of feeling rather than thinking about a written message.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"/&gt;

== Cognitive science and linguistics ==
[[George Lakoff]] and his collaborators have developed several lines of evidence that suggest that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects, actions and situations (such as containers, spaces, trajectories) to understand other more complex domains (such as mathematics, relationships or death). Lakoff argues that ''all'' cognition is based on knowledge that comes from the body and that other domains are mapped onto our embodied knowledge using a combination of [[conceptual metaphor]], [[image schema]] and [[prototype theory|prototypes]].

=== Conceptual metaphor ===
{{Main|Conceptual metaphor}}
Lakoff and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}} showed that humans use metaphor ubiquitously and that metaphors operate at a conceptual level (i.e., they map one conceptual domain onto another), they involve an unlimited number of individual expressions and that the same metaphor is used conventionally throughout a culture.
Lakoff and his collaborators have collected thousands of examples of conceptual metaphors in many domains.{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}{{sfn|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}

For example, people will typically use language about journeys to discuss the history and status of a love affair, a metaphor Lakoff and Johnson call "LOVE IS A JOURNEY". It is used in such expression as: "we arrived at a crossroads," "we parted ways", "we hit the rocks" (as in a sea journey), "she's in the driver's seat", or, simply, "we're together". In cases like these, something complex (a love affair) is described in terms of something that can be done with a body (travel through space).

=== Image schema ===
{{Main|Image schema}}
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}

=== Prototypes ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}
Prototypes are "typical" members of a category, e.g. a robin is a prototypical bird, but a penguin is not. The role of prototypes in human cognition was first identified and studied by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Rosch | first=Eleanor | authorlink=Eleanor Rosch

| ref=harv | volume=4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to show that prototypical objects are more easily categorized than non-prototypical objects, and that people answered questions about a category as a whole by reasoning about a prototype. She also identified [[prototype theory#Basic level categories|basic level categories]]:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; categories that have prototypes that are easily visualized (such as a chair) and are associated with basic physical motions (such as "sitting"). Prototypes of basic level categories are used to reason about more general categories.

Prototype theory has been used to explain human performance on many different cognitive tasks and in a large variety of domains. George Lakoff argues that prototype theory shows that the categories that people use are based on our experience of having a body and have no resemblance to logical [[class (philosophy)|classes]] or [[type-token distinction|types]]. For Lakoff, this shows that traditional [[objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivist]] accounts of [[truth]] cannot be correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakoff, G. [[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind]]. '' University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic argument against embodiment in its strict form is based on abstract meaning. Whereas the meanings of the words ‘eye’ and ‘grasp’ can be explained, to a degree, by pointing to objects and actions, those of ‘beauty’ and ‘freedom’ cannot.&lt;ref&gt;

| pmid=23932069
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that some common sensorimotor knowledge is immanent in ''freeing'' actions or instantiations of ''beauty'', but it seems likely that additional semantic binding principles are behind such concepts. So might it be necessary, after all, to place abstract semantics in an amodal meaning system? A remarkable observation has recently been offered that may be of the essence in this context: abstract terms show an over-proportionally strong tendency to be semantically linked to knowledge about emotions.&lt;ref name="meteyard"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This additional embodied–semantic link accounts for advantages in processing speed for abstract emotional terms over otherwise matched control words.&lt;ref name="kousta" /&gt; In addition, abstract words strongly activate anterior cingulate cortex, a site known to be relevant for emotion processing&lt;ref name="vigliocco"&gt;
{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it appears that at least some abstract words are semantically grounded in emotion knowledge.

If abstract emotion words indeed receive their meaning through grounding in emotion it is of crucial relevance&lt;ref name="wittgenstein"&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Wittgenstein, L. 
|title=Philosophical Investigations. 
|year = 1953

|year = 2009
|title = Wittgenstein: Understanding and Meaning, Part 1: Essays. Wiley-Blackwell}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the link between an abstract emotion word and its abstract concept is via manifestation of the latter in prototypical actions. The child learns an abstract emotion word such as 'joy' because it shows JOY-expressing action schemas, which language-teaching adults use as criteria for correct application of the abstract emotion word&lt;ref name="vigliocco" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wittgenstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bookWitt" /&gt; Thus, the manifestation of emotions in actions becomes the crucial link between word use and internal state, and hence between sign and meaning. Only after a stock of abstract emotion words has been grounded in emotion-expressing action can further emotion terms be learnt from context.

== Artificial intelligence and robotics ==

=== History of artificial intelligence ===

The experience of AI research provides another line of evidence supporting the embodied mind thesis. In the early history of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] successes in programming high-level reasoning tasks such as chess-playing led to an unfounded optimism that all AI problems would be relatively quickly solved. These programs simulated intelligence using logic and high-level abstract symbols (an approach called [[Good old-fashioned AI]]). This "disembodied" approach ran into serious difficulties in the 1970s and 80s, as researchers discovered that abstract, disembodied reasoning was highly inefficient and could not achieve human-levels of competence on many simple tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See {{slink|History of AI|The problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding agencies (such as [[DARPA]]) withdrew funding because the field of AI had failed to achieve its stated objectives, leading to difficult period now known as the "[[AI winter]]". Many AI researchers began to doubt that high level symbolic reasoning could ever perform well enough to solve simple problems.

[[Rodney Brooks]] argued in the mid-80s that these symbolic approaches were failing because researchers did not appreciate the importance of sensorimotor skills to intelligence in general, and applied these principals to robotics (an approach he called "[[Nouvelle AI]]"). Another successful new direction was [[neural network]]s—programs based on the actual structures within human bodies that gave rise to intelligence and learning. In the 90s, [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|statistical AI]] achieved high levels of success in industry without using any symbolic reasoning, but instead using probabilistic techniques to make "guesses" and improve them incrementally. This process is similar to the way human beings are able to make fast, intuitive choices without stopping to reason symbolically.

=== Moravec's paradox ===
{{Main|Moravec's paradox}}

Moravec's paradox is the discovery by [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level [[reasoning]] requires very little computation, but low-level [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by [[Hans Moravec]] (whence the name) and others in the 1980s.
As [[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.{{sfn|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Approach to artificial intelligence ===

==== Solving problems of perception and locomotion directly ====
{{See also|Nouvelle AI|Situated|Behavior based AI|Embodied cognitive science}}
Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers have argued that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak as well as a human being. As early as 1950, [[Alan Turing]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can
buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a
child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc.  (Turing, 1950).{{sfn|Turing 1950}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Embodiment theory was brought into artificial intelligence most notably by [[Rodney Brooks]] who showed in the 1980s that [[robot]]s could be more effective if they 'thought' ([[automated planning|planned]] or [[Information processing|processed]]) and [[perception|perceived]] as little as possible.  The robot's intelligence is geared towards only handling the minimal amount of information necessary to make its [[behavior]] be appropriate and/or as desired by its creator.

Others have argued that without taking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment, it is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during language acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic actions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"&gt;Paradowski, Michał B. 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/2400943/Developing_Embodied_Multisensory_Dialogue_Agents Developing embodied multisensory dialogue agents]. In: Rzepka, Rafał, Michał Ptaszyński &amp; Paweł Dybala (Eds.) Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents. Birmingham: The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, 6–14.&lt;/ref&gt; There have thus been suggestions that while robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit from strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their processes and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in situated human-machine interaction, and that the concept of multisensory integration be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information combined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"/&gt;

The embodied approach to AI has been given several names by different schools of researchers, including: [[Nouvelle AI]] (Brooks' term), [[Situated]] AI, [[Behavior based AI]] and [[Embodied cognitive science]].

==Neuroscience==
{{Cleanup rewrite|comprehensive|2=section|date=December 2011}}

One source of inspiration for embodiment theory has been research in [[cognitive neuroscience]], such as the proposals of [[Gerald Edelman]] concerning how mathematical and computational models such as [[neuronal group selection]] and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization.

Rohrer (2005) discusses how both our neural and developmental embodiment shape both our mental and linguistic categorizations. The degree of thought abstraction has been found to be associated with physical distance which then affects associated ideas and perception of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liberman N, Trope Y |date=2008-11-21|title= The Psychology of Transcending the Here and Now|journal= Science|volume= 322|pages= 1201–1205| doi=10.1126/science.1161958|pmid=19023074|issue = 5905|pmc = 2643344|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in [[neuropsychology]], such as the theories of consciousness of [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]], [[Gerald Edelman]], and [[Antonio Damasio]].

The modeling work of cognitive neuroscientists such as [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter Freeman]] seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of [[dynamical systems]] theory and [[neurophenomenology]], but rejects the idea that the brain uses representations to do so (a position also espoused by [[Gerhard Werner]]).

==Criticisms==

Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad, covering a wide range of concepts.  Methods to study embodied cognition vary from experiment to experiment based on the [[operational definition]] used by researchers.  There is much evidence for embodied cognition, although interpretation of results and their significance may be disputed.  Researchers continue to search for the best way to study and interpret embodied cognition.

===Infants as examples===

Some&lt;ref name=Longo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longo|first=M. R.|title=What's embodied and how can we tell?|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|pages=1207–1209|doi=10.1002/ejsp.684|issue=7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticize the notion that pre-verbal children provide an ideal channel for studying embodied cognition, especially embodied [[social cognition]].&lt;ref name="Daum et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daum|first1=Moritz M.|last2=Sommerville|first2=Jessica A.|last3=Prinz|first3=Wolfgang|title=Disentangling embodied and symbolic modes of social understanding|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1214–1216|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.686}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It may be impossible to know when a pre-verbal infant is a "pure model" of embodied cognition, since infants experience dramatic changes in social behavior throughout development.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  A 9-month old has reached a different developmental stage than a 2-month old.  Looking-time and reaching measures of embodied cognition may not represent embodied cognition since infants develop [[object permanence]] of objects they can see before they develop object permanence with objects they can touch.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  True embodied cognition suggests that children would have to first physically engage with an object to understand object permanence.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

The response to this critique is that infants are "ideal models" of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;  Infants are the best models because they utilize symbols less than adults do.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Looking-time could likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants have not developed certain [[fine motor skills]] yet.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;

===Overinterpretation?===

Some criticize the conclusions made by researchers about embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=F.|title=Embodied cognition|journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=9|pages=619–628|doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9175-x|issue=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pencil-in-teeth study is frequently cited as an example of these invalidly drawn conclusions.  The researchers believed that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles represented embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al." /&gt;  However, opponents argue that the effects of this exercise were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;  Many cases of facilitative movements of the body may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;

== Six views of embodied cognition ==

# '''"Cognition is situated'''. Cognitive activity takes place in the context of a real-world environment, and inherently involves perception and action." One example of this is moving around a room while, at the same time, trying to decide where the furniture should go.
# '''"Cognition is time-pressured'''. We are 'mind on the hoof' (Clark, 1997), and cognition must be understood in terms of how it functions under the pressure of real-time interaction with the environment." When you're under pressure to make a decision, the choice that is made emerges from the confluence of pressures that you're under.  In the absence of pressure, a decision may be made differently. 
# '''"We off-load cognitive work onto the environment'''. Because of limits on our information-processing abilities (e.g., limits on attention and working memory), we exploit the environment to reduce the cognitive workload. We make the environment hold or even manipulate information for us, and we harvest that information only on a need-to-know basis." This is seen when people have calendars, agendas, PDAs, or anything to help them with everyday functions. We write things down so we can use the information when we need it, instead of taking the time to memorize or encode it into our minds.
# '''"The environment is part of the cognitive system'''. The information flow between mind and world is so dense and continuous that, for scientists studying the nature of cognitive activity, the mind alone is not a meaningful unit of analysis." This statement means that the production of cognitive activity does not come from the mind alone, but rather is a mixture of the mind and the environmental situation that we are in. These interactions become part of our cognitive systems. Our thinking, decision-making, and future are all impacted by our environmental situations.
# '''"Cognition is for action'''. The function of the mind is to guide action and things such as perception and memory must be understood in terms of their contribution to situation-appropriate behavior." This claim has to do with the purpose of perception and cognition. For example, visual information is processed to extract identity, location, and affordances (ways that we might interact with objects).  A prominent anatomical distinction is drawn between the "what" (ventral) and "where" (dorsal) pathways in visual processing.  However, the commonly labeled "where" pathway is also the "how" pathway, at least partially dedicated to action.   
# '''"Off-line cognition is body-based'''. Even when decoupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is grounded in mechanisms that evolved for interaction with the environment – that is, mechanisms of sensory processing and motor control." This is shown with infants or toddlers best. Children utilize skills and abilities they were born with, such as sucking, grasping, and listening, to learn more about the environment. The skills are broken down into five main categories that combine sensory with motor skills, sensorimotor functions. The five main skills are:
## [[Mental image|Mental Imagery]]: Is visualizing something that is not currently present in your environment.  For example, imagining a future activity, or recalling how many windows are on the first floor of a house you once lived in (even though you did not count them explicitly while living there).  
## [[Working Memory]]: Short term memory
## [[Episodic memory|Episodic Memory]]: Long term memory of specific events.  
## [[Implicit memory|Implicit Memory]]: means by which we learn certain skills until they become automatic for us. An example of this would be an adult brushing his/her teeth, or an expert race car driver putting the car in drive.
## Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Having a mental model of something will increase problem-solving approaches.

===Criticism of the six claims===
Margaret Wilson adds: "Some authors go so far as to complain that the phrase 'situated cognition' implies, falsely, that there also exists cognition that is not situated (Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993, p. 50)."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 627).&lt;/ref&gt; Of her six claims, she notes in her abstract, "the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 625).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnobiology''' is the [[Science|scientific study]] of the way living things are treated or used by different human cultures. It studies the [[System dynamics|dynamic relationships]] between people, [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;[http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html Society of Ethnobiology's "What is Ethnobiology" webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416233913/http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html |date=2008-04-16 }}  Accessed 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"People-biota-environment" interactions around the world are documented and studied through time, across [[culture]]s, and across [[List of academic disciplines|disciplines]] in a search for [[Validity (logic)|valid]], [[Reliabilism|reliable]] answers to two 'defining' questions: "How and in what ways do human societies use nature, and how and in what ways do human societies view nature?"&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Brent (1992) Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings (15th century–19th century)===
[[File:WrightMolyneux-ChartoftheWorld-c1599.jpg|thumb|16th-century English map of the world showing extent of western geographic knowledge in 1599]]

Biologists have been interested in [[Traditional knowledge|local biological knowledge]] since the time [[Europe]]ans started [[European colonialism|colonising]] the world, from the 15th century onwards. Paul Sillitoe wrote that:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;

{{quote|Europeans not only sought to understand the new regions they intruded into but also were on the look-out for resources that they might profitably exploit, engaging in practices that today we should consider tantamount to [[biopiracy]]. Many new crops .. entered into Europe during this period, such as the potato, tomato, pumpkin, maize, and tobacco.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt; (Page 121)}}

Local biological knowledge, collected and sampled over these early centuries significantly informed the early development of modern [[biology]]:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;
* during the 17th century [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] benefited from local biological knowledge in producing his catalogue, [[Rumphius#Herbarium Amboinense|''"Herbarium Amboinense"'']], covering more than 1,200 species of the plants in [[Indonesia]];
* during the 18th century, [[Carl Linnaeus]] relied upon Rumphius's work, and also corresponded with other people all around the world when developing the [[Scientific classification|biological classification]] scheme that now underlies the arrangement of much of the accumulated knowledge of the biological sciences.
* during the 19th century, [[Charles Darwin]], the 'father' of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]], on his [[Charles Darwin#Journey of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]] took interest in the local biological knowledge of peoples he encountered.

===Phase I (1900s–1940s)===
Ethnobiology itself, as a distinctive practice, only emerged during the [[20th century]] as part of the records then being made about [[Other (philosophy)|other peoples]], and other cultures. As a practice, it was nearly always ancillary to other pursuits when documenting others' languages, [[folklore]], and natural resource use. Roy Ellen commented that:

{{quote|At its earliest and most rudimentary, this comprised listing the names and uses of plants and animals in native non-Western or 'traditional' populations often in the context of salvage ethnography ..[ie] ''ethno''-biology as the descriptive biological knowledge of 'primitive' peoples.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"&gt;Ellen, Roy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This 'first phase' in the development of ethnobiology as a practice has been described as still having an essentially [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] purpose, often focusing on identifying those 'native' plants, animals and technologies of some potential use and value within increasingly dominant [[Capitalism|western economic systems]]&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Examples of studies from this 'first' phase in the development of ethnobiology include Stevenson (1915), Castetter (1944) and Harrington (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase II (1950s–1970s)===
Arising out of practices in Phase I (above) came a 'second phase' in the development of 'ethnobiology', with researchers now striving to better document and better understand how other peoples' themselves "conceptualize and categorize" the natural world around them.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; In Sillitoe's words:

{{quote|By the mid-20th century .. utilitarian-focussed studies started to give way to more cognitively framed ones, notably studies that centred on elucidating classificatory schemes.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"&gt;Sillitoe, Paul (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; (Page 122)}}

[[File:Tawbuid men.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Some Mangyan (who count the Hanunóo among their members) men, on [[Mindoro]] island, [[Philippines]], where Harold Conklin did his ethnobiological work]]

This 'second' phase is marked:&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;
* in [[Northern America]] (mid 1950s) with [[Harold Conklin]]'s completing his doctorate entitled ''"The relation of [[Hanuno'o language|Hanunóo]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213135409/http://www.mangyan.org/tribal/index.html#hanunoo] culture to the plant world"''&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, H.C. (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[Great Britain|Britain]] (mid 1960s) with the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' book ''The Savage Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; legitimating "folk biological classification" as a worthy cross-cultural research endeavour
* in [[France]] (mid 1970s) with [[André-Georges Haudricourt]]'s [[Linguistics|linguistic]] studies of [[botanical nomenclature]]&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt, Andre-Georges (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Porteres' and others work in economic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Porteres, R. (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present (1980s–2000s)===
By the turn of the 21st century ethnobiological practices, research, and findings have had a significant impact and influence across a number of fields of biological inquiry including [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on ecology, see Balée (1998); Plotkin (1995); Schultes &amp; von Reis (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[conservation biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on conservation biology see Cunningham (2001); Johannes (1989); Laird (2002); Tuxill &amp; Nabhan (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; [[development studies]],&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on development studies, see Warren, Slikkerveer &amp; Brokensha (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on political ecology see Zerner (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of Ethnobiology advises on its web page:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ethnobiology is a rapidly growing field of research, gaining professional, student, and public interest .. internationally
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethnobiology has come out from its place as an ancillary practice in the shadows of other core pursuits, to arise as a whole field of inquiry and research in its own right: taught within many tertiary institutions and educational programs around the world;&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; with its own methods manuals,&lt;ref&gt;Ethnbiology methods manuals include Alexiades (1996) and Martin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; its own readers,&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology reader is Minnis (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own textbooks&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology textbook is Cotton (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of inquiry==

===Usage===
All societies make use of the biological world in which they are situated, but there are wide differences in use, informed by perceived need, available technology, and the culture's sense of morality and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists investigate what lifeforms are used for what purposes, the particular techniques of use, the reasons for these choices, and symbolic and spiritual implications of them.

===Taxonomy===
Different societies divide the living world up in different ways. Ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in particular cultures for living things, from the most specific terms (analogous to species names in [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnean]] biology) to more general terms (such as 'tree' and even more generally 'plant'). They also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of the classification system (if there is one; there is ongoing debate as to whether there must always be an implied hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Roy (1993) pages 216 forward&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological, moral and spiritual significance===
Societies invest themselves and their world with meaning partly through their answers to questions like "how did the world happen?", "how and why did people come to be?", "what are proper practices, and why?", and "what realities exist beyond or behind our physical experience?" Understanding these elements of a societies' perspective is important to cultural research in general, and ethnobiologists investigate how a societies' view of the natural world informs and is informed by them.

===Traditional ecological knowledge===
In order to live effectively in a given place, a people needs to understand the particulars of their environment, and many traditional societies have complex and subtle understandings of the places in which they live.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists seek to share in these understandings, subject to ethical concerns regarding [[Indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]] and [[cultural appropriation]].

===Cross-cultural ethnobiology===
In cross cultural ethnobiology research, two or more communities participate simultaneously. This enables the researcher to compare how a bio-resource is used by different communities.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, F.M. and Narasimhan, D. (2012). ''Ethnobotany of the Kondh, Poraja, Gadaba and Bonda of the Koraput region of Odisha, India''. D.K. Printworld, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

===Ethnobotany===
{{main article|Ethnobotany}}

:Ethnobotany investigates the relationship between human societies and plants: how humans use plants – as food, technology, medicine, and in ritual contexts; how they view and understand them; and their symbolic and spiritual role in a culture.

===Ethnozoology===
{{main article|Ethnozoology}}
{{further information|Birds in culture|Insects in culture}}

:The subfield ethnozoology focuses on the relationship between animals and humans throughout human history. It studies human practices such as hunting, fishing and [[animal husbandry]] in space and time, and human perspectives about animals such as their place in the moral and spiritual realms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Ethnoecology===
{{main article|Ethnoecology}}

:Ethnoecology refers to an increasingly dominant 'ethnobiological' research [[paradigm]] focused, primarily, on documenting, describing, and understanding how other peoples perceive, manage, and use whole [[ecosystem]]s.

==Other disciplines==
Studies and writings within ethnobiology draw upon research from fields including [[archaeology]], [[geography]], [[linguistics]], [[systematics]], [[population biology]], [[ecology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnography]], [[pharmacology]], [[nutrition]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Ethics==
Through much of the history of ethnobiology, its practitioners were primarily from dominant cultures, and the benefit of their work often accrued to the dominant culture, with little control or benefit invested in the [[indigenous peoples]] whose practice and knowledge they recorded.

Just as many of those indigenous societies work to assert legitimate control over physical resources such as traditional lands or artistic and ritual objects, many work to assert legitimate control over their [[indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]].

In an age when the potential exists for large profits from the discovery of, for example, new food crops or medicinal plants, modern ethnobiologists must consider [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property rights,]] the need for informed consent, the potential for harm to informants, and their "debt to the societies in which they work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/committees/ethics/ethcode.htm Code of Ethics of the American Anthropological Association, section A]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, these questions must be considered not only in light of western industrialized nations' common understanding of ethics and law, but also in light of the ethical and legal standards of the societies from which the ethnobiologist draws information.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fictitious domain method''' is a method to find the solution of a [[partial differential equation]]s on a complicated [[Domain of a function|domain]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, by substituting  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

==General formulation==
Assume in some area &lt;math&gt;D \subset \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; we want to find solution &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 Lu = - \phi(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
 lu = g(x), x \in \partial D
&lt;/math&gt;

The basic idea of fictitious domains method is to substitute  a given  problem
posed on a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with a new problem posed on a simple [[shaped domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;). For example, we can choose ''n''-dimensional parallelepiped as &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Problem in the [[extended domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; for the new solution &lt;math&gt;u_{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 L_\epsilon u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), x = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n) \in \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 l_\epsilon u_\epsilon = g^\epsilon(x), x \in \partial \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

It is necessary to pose the problem in the extended area so that the following condition is fulfilled:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon (x) \xrightarrow[\epsilon \rightarrow 0]{ } u(x), x \in D
&lt;/math&gt;

== Simple example, 1-dimensional problem ==

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = -2, \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \quad (1) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Prolongation by leading coefficients ===

&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dx}k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx} = - \phi^{\epsilon}(x), 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Discontinuous [[coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;k^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and right part of equation previous equation we obtain from expressions:

: &lt;math&gt;
k^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 1, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\phi^\epsilon (x)=\begin{cases} 2, &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 2c_0, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2 
 \end{cases}\quad (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u_\epsilon(0) = 0, u_\epsilon(2) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon] = 0,\  \left[k^\epsilon(x)\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[ \cdot ]&lt;/math&gt; means:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [p(x)] = p(x + 0) - p(x - 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (1) has [[analytical solution]] therefore we can easily obtain error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon^2), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Prolongation by lower-order coefficients===
&lt;math&gt;u_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt; solution of problem:

: &lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d^2u_\epsilon}{dx^2} - c^\epsilon(x)u_\epsilon = - \phi^\epsilon(x), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 \quad (4)
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\phi^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; we take the same as in (3), and expression for &lt;math&gt;c^{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
c^\epsilon(x)=\begin{cases} 
  0,                    &amp;  0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \\ 
  \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, &amp; 1 &lt; x &lt; 2.
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Boundary conditions for equation (4) same as for (2).

Connection conditions in the point &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
 [u_\epsilon(0)] = 0,\  \left[\frac{du_\epsilon}{dx}\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Error:

: &lt;math&gt;
 u(x) - u_\epsilon(x) = O(\epsilon), \quad 0 &lt; x &lt; 1

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23372">'''Garden waste''', or '''[[green waste]] dumping''' is the act of discarding or depositing garden waste somewhere it does not belong.    
 
[[Green waste|Garden waste]] is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boldrin | first1 = A. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Seasonal generation and composition of garden waste in Aarhus (Denmark) | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2009.11.031 | pmid = 20042325 | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 551–557 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/seasonal-generation-and-composition-of-garden-waste-in-aarhus-denmark(4b0d9f5e-3ce8-4e63-ac0a-97fdd557b784).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122&amp;nbsp;kg to 155&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="Aarhus 2009"/&gt;

Garden waste may be used to create [[compost]] or [[mulch]], which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building [[humus]]. The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Bertoldi | first1 = M. | last2 = Vallini | first2 = G. | last3 = Pera | first3 = A. | year = 1983 | title = The Biology of Composting: a Review | doi = 10.1177/0734242x8300100118 | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 157–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow ([[propagules]]), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as [[weed control]], forest fire.

==Cause==
There are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = T | year = 2005 | title = Another way forward | doi = 10.1038/vital306-2c | journal = Vital | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation.&lt;ref name="Another way forward"/&gt; Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakayama | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = ChemInform Abstract: Chemistry of Inner Salts which Are Composed of (R2N)2C+- and -CX2- (X: S, Se) Ions | doi = 10.1002/chin.200226261 | journal = ChemInform | volume = 33 | issue = 26| pages = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of [[Fallopia]], app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of [[Heracleum mantegazzianum]], 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik &amp; von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24-25.

An Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at [[landfill]] sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fabricius | first1 = K. | last2 = Logan | first2 = M. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = S. | last4 = Lewis | first4 = S. | last5 = Brodie | first5 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002–2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.001 | journal = Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = A1–A15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qvenild | first1 = M. | last2 = Setten | first2 = G. | last3 = Skår | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Politicising plants: Dwelling and invasive alien species in domestic gardens in Norway | doi = 10.1080/00291951.2013.870599 | journal = [[Norwegian Journal of Geography|Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography]] | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 22–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rusterholz | first1 = H. | last2 = Wirz | first2 = D. | last3 = Baur | first3 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Garden waste deposits as a source for non-native plants in mixed deciduous forests | doi = 10.1111/j.1654-109x.2011.01175.x | journal = Applied Vegetation Science | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 329–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Airoldi | first1 = L. | last2 = Balata | first2 = D. | last3 = Beck | first3 = M.W. | year = 2008 | title = The Gray Zone: Relationships between habitat loss and marine diversity and their applications in conservation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 366 | issue = | pages = 8–15 | doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2008.07.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = D. | last3 = Lonsdale | first3 = W.M. | last4 = Evans | first4 = H. | last5 = Clout | first5 = M. | last6 = Bazzaz | first6 = F.A. | year = 2000 | title = Biotic invasions: causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 689–710 | doi=10.2307/2641039| jstor = 2641039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/08450krp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.
Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"&gt;Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. (2016). Ehp.qld.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher  levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"&gt;Home - Maroondah City Council. (2016). Maroondah.vic.gov.au. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

If plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife.&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;
This dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = D | year = 1998 | title = Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida | doi = 10.2307/2640955 | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = 975 | jstor = 2640955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Green and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further [[illegal dumping]].

===Increased fire risk===
Dumping garden waste in [[nature reserves]] and parks surrounding and near [[urban areas]] can effect directly and indirectly the existing [[flora]] and [[fauna]], as well as human life through the  increased risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional  fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scorza | first1 = C. | last2 = Cavalheiro | first2 = E. | last3 = Scorza | first3 = F. | year = 2008 | title = Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C (MEF2C) expression in the dentate gyrus during development and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus: a preliminary report | doi = 10.1590/s0004-282x2008000500024 | journal = Arq. Neuro-Psiquiatr | volume = 66 | issue = 3b| pages = 731–735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fires can lead to an overall loss of [[habitat]] and biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindenmayer | first1 = D. | last2 = Burgman | first2 = M. | last3 = Akçakaya | first3 = H. | last4 = Lacy | first4 = R. | last5 = Possingham | first5 = H. | year = 1995 | title = A review of the generic computer programs ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX for modelling the viability of wildlife metapopulations | doi = 10.1016/0304-3800(94)00085-v | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 161–174 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10194/hp_em_82_95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat to biodiversity===
The invasion of exotic plant [[species]] into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allison | first1 = H. | last2 = Hobbs | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Natural Resource Management at Four Social Scales: Psychological Type Matters | doi = 10.1007/s00267-010-9442-1 | pmid = 20148248 | journal = Environmental Management | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 590–602 | url = http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/1435/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A. | last2 = Singhal | first2 = G. | year = 1999 | title = Journal search results - Cite This For Me. | doi = 10.1023/a:1007095426376 | journal = Photosynthetica | volume = 36 | issue = 1/2| pages = 213–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Weed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the [[plant community]] and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species.
When a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other [[organisms]] that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/mahc.2004.35 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=Table of Contents | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | pages=c2| year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The surface of α-subunit loop 1 distant from the subunit interface is exposed in the hCG lutropin receptor complex | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4165(00)00097-0 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects | volume = 1475 | issue = 3| pages = 390–394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly [[introduced species]] may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Doria R.|date=1998-01-01|title=Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida|jstor=2640955|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=4|pages=975–989|doi=10.2307/2640955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterways quality===
The dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Water quality"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maroondah.vic.gov.au/WaterQuality.aspx|title=Water quality|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maroondah.vic.gov.au"/&gt;  Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.&lt;ref name="ehp.qld.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt;

==Causes / stakeholders==
Illegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=164054495563058;res=IELAPA |title=Tougher penalties for illegal waste in NSW [online]|journal=Waste Management and Environment |volume=25|issue=2|pages=14|date=March 2014|last1=Parrino|first1=Maysaa|last2=Kaoutarani|first2=Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly.&lt;ref name="Water quality"/&gt; Alligator weed (''Alternanthera philoxeroides'' (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panetta|first=F. Dane|last2=Lawes|first2=Roger|date=2005-09-01|title=Evaluation of weed eradication programs: the delimitation of extent|journal=Diversity and Distributions|language=en|volume=11|issue=5|pages=435–442|doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00179.x|issn=1472-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
Education on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Restricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of [[illegal dumping]], thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young.&lt;ref&gt;National Wildlife Federation. (2016). Nwf.org. Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.nwf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears &amp; Anderson suggest&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinney | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0883:ubac]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 52 | issue = 10| page = 883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains&lt;ref name="Urbanization, Biodiversity 2002"/&gt; the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species.

Composting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Dr. Reynolds, ''et al.'' reply | doi = 10.3899/jrheum.080694 | pmid = 19208581 | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 454–5; author reply 455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). 
Fostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. 2000. Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species. http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Policy&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Utilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008).
Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 13 May 2016, from http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/waste/150111env-guide-solid-waste-landfills.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.&lt;ref&gt;Increased penalties for illegal waste dumping in NSW - Colin Biggers &amp; Paisley. (2016). Cbp.com.au. Retrieved 21 May 2016, from http://www.cbp.com.au/publications/2013/november/increased-penalties-for-illegal-waste-dumping-in-n&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The new section of the ''POEO Act'' (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/waste/illegal_dumping.html|title=Illegal dumping|last=Protection|first=jurisdiction=Queensland; sector=government; corporateName=Department of Environment and Heritage|website=www.ehp.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani &amp; Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014-16, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.

{{defn|1=  Related to student engagement and participation. For example, listening is perceived to be a passive skill, but is actually active because it involves students in decoding meaning. }}

{{Term|term= Alphabet |content= [[Alphabet]] }}
{{defn|1=  A complete standardized set of letters – basic written symbols – each of which roughly represents a phoneme of a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past. English uses the Roman or Latin alphabet, which consists of vowels and consonants. }}

{{bq|1= {{Term|term= Vowel |content= [[Vowel]] }}
{{defn|1= A sound in spoken language characterized by an open configuration of the voice tract so that there is no build-up of air pressure above the vocal cords. The Roman vowels include the letters “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” and sometimes “y”. In all languages, vowels form the nucleus of a syllable. A vowel also completes a syllable. }}

{{Term|term= Semivowel |content= [[Semivowel]] }}

{{Term|term= Burn-out }}
{{defn|1=  Fatigue usually based on either the stress of overwork or boredom with the same task. }}

{{Term|term= Chomsky, Noam |content= [[Chomsky, Noam]] }}
{{defn|1=  The ideas of the American linguistic theorist Noam Chomsky can be very abstract, in contrast to the very practical process of communicative language teaching. Chomsky’s theories of knowledge of language and language acquisition relate as much to the study of human nature as to language teaching. As Steven Pinker explains{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}},
Chomsky’s claim that…all humans speak a single language is based on the hypothesis that the same symbol-manipulating machinery, without exception, underlies the world’s languages. Linguists have long known that the basic design features of language are found everywhere… A common grammatical code, neutral between production and comprehension, allows speakers to produce any linguistic message they can understand, and vice versa. Words have stable meanings, linked to them by arbitrary convention….Languages can convey meanings that are abstract and remote in time or space from the speaker, (and) linguistic forms are infinite in number.  }}

{{Term|term= Communicative Competence }}
{{defn|1=  The role of language learning is to achieve communicative competence. Communicative competence has four parts, which we call language competencies.

# '''Grammatical competence''' is how well a person has learned that features and rules of the language. This includes vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence formation. The main question is: How well does a person understand English grammar?
# '''Sociolinguistic competence''' is how well a person speaks and is understood in various social contexts. This depends on factors such as status of those speaking to each other, the purpose of the interaction, and the expectations of the interaction. The main question is: how socially acceptable is the person’s use of English in different settings?
# '''Discourse competence''' is how well a person can combine grammatical forms and meanings to achieve different types (genres) of speaking or writing. The main question is: How well does one properly combine all the languages elements to speak or write in English?
# '''Strategic competence''' is how well the person uses both verbal forms and non-verbal communication to compensate for lack of knowledge in the other three competencies. The main question is: Can a person find ways to communicate when he or she is lacking some knowledge of English? }}

{{Term|term= Communicative Language Teaching |content= [[Communicative language teaching|Communicative Language Teaching]] {{anchor|CLT|Communicative language teaching}} }}
{{defn|1=  Communicative language teaching (CLT) is an approach to foreign or second language learning which emphasizes that the goal of language learning is communicative competence. The communicative approach has been developed particularly by British applied linguists as a reaction away from grammar-based approaches such as the aural-oral (audio-lingual) approach. Teaching materials used with a communicative approach teach the language needed to express and understand different kinds of functions, such as requesting, describing, expressing likes and dislikes, etc. Also, they emphasize the processes of communication, such as using language appropriately in different types of situations; using language to perform different kinds of tasks, e.g. to solve puzzles, to get information, etc.; using language for social interaction with other people. }}

{{Term|term= Competence learning model }}
{{defn|1=  Especially when we take specialized courses, learning seems to take place in four stages. We begin with unconscious incompetence: we do not know how much we do not know. Once we begin our course of studies, we become consciously incompetent: we know how much we do not know. From there we proceed to conscious competence: we have functional knowledge and can perform competently, but we have to think about what we are doing. Finally, after we have had enough experience, we become unconsciously competent: we know it and we can do it, and we do not much have to think about it. This model applies to a great deal of language learning, to TEFL training and to many other areas of study.  }}

{{Term|term= Facilitator |content= [[Facilitator]] }}
{{defn|1=  A concept related to a teacher’s approach to interaction with students. Particularly in communicative classrooms, teachers tend to work in partnership with students to develop their language skills.

The facilitator may also take the role of mentor or coach rather than director. }}

{{Term|term= Feedback }}
{{defn|1=  Reporting back or giving information back, usually to the teacher; feedback can be verbal, written or nonverbal in the form of facial expressions, gestures, behaviours; teachers can use feedback to discover whether a student understands, is learning, and likes an activity. }}

{{Term|term= Grammatical syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  A syllabus based on the grammar or structure of a language; often part of the grammar translation method. }}

{{Term|term= Guided practice }}
{{defn|1=  An intermediate stage in language practice - between "controlled practice" (q.v.) and "free practice" (q.v.) activities; this stage features allows for some creativity from the students. }}

{{defn|1=   A group of words whose meaning is different from the meanings of the individual words: “She let the cat out of the bag” or “He was caught red-handed.” }}

{{Term|term= Inductive teaching }}
{{defn|1=  Also known as induction, from the verb “to induce”; a facilitative, student-centred teaching technique where the students discover language rules through extensive use of the language and exposure to many examples. This is the preferred technique in communicative language teaching. (See “ Deductive teaching”.) }}

{{Term|term= Input hypothesis }}
{{defn|1=  Hypothesis that states that learners learn language through exposure to language that is just beyond their level of comprehension. See “Krashen, Stephen”. }}

{{Term|term= Krashen, Stephen |content= [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen, Stephen]] }}
{{defn|1=  Krashen’s Theory of Second Language Acquisition is a highly practical theory for communicative language learning. This notion of second language acquisition consists of five main hypotheses: the Acquisition-Learning hypothesis; the Monitor hypothesis; the Natural Order hypothesis; the Input hypothesis; and the Affective Filter hypothesis. These hypotheses represent practical interpretations of what happens in language acquisition, and they form the basis of a system of language teaching called “The Natural Method.” }}

{{Term|term= Language content }}
{{defn|1=  Language has three components, which are commonly taught as language items.

# '''Structural items''' are grammatical points about the language. CL teachers frequently introduce these as examples or model sentences, and they are often called “patterns”. 
# '''Phonological items''' are features of the sound system of the language, including intonation, word stress, rhythm and register. A common way to teach phonology is simply to have students repeat vocabulary using proper stress and pronunciation. 
# '''A lexical item''' is a new bit of vocabulary. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether an item is structural or lexical. For example, the teacher could teach phrasal verbs like “chop down” and “stand up” as lexis or structure. }}
 
{{Term|term= Language experience approach }}
{{defn|1=  An approach based on teaching first language reading to young children, but adapted for use with adults.

{{Term|term= Language learning requirements }}
{{defn|1=  To learn language, students have four needs: They must be exposed to the language. They must understand its meaning and structure. And they must practice it. Teachers should hold their students as able. They should not over-explain or make things too easy. Learning comes through discovery. }}

{{Term|term= Language skills |content= [[Language skills]] }}
{{defn|1=  In language teaching, this refers to the mode or manner in which language is used. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are generally called the four language skills. Speaking and writing are the productive skills, while reading and listening are the receptive skills. Often the skills are divided into sub-skills, such as discriminating sounds in connected speech, or understanding relationships within a sentence.  }}

{{Term|term= Learning burden }}
{{defn|1=  These are the features of the word that the teacher actually needs to be taught, and can differ dramatically from word to word. Especially in lexis, the teacher needs to reduce learning burden by, for example, reducing the number of definitions and uses presented.  }}

{{Term|term= Learning factors }}
{{defn|1=  For EFL teachers, four factors outside aptitude and attitude affect the rate at which a student learns a second language. These are (1) the student’s motivation, including whether it is instrumental or integrative; (2) the amount of time the student spends in class and practicing the language outside class; (3) the teacher’s approach to teaching; and (4) the teacher’s effectiveness and teaching style. The most important of these motivators are the first two, which are also the two the teacher has least control over.  See also “aptitude”, “attitude” and “TEFL vs. TEFL”. }}

{{Term|term= Lesson plan }}
{{defn|1=  An outline or plan that guides teaching of a lesson; includes the following: pre-assessment of class; aims and objectives; warm-up and review; engagement, study, activation of language (controlled, guided and free practice); and assessment of lesson. A good lesson plan describes procedures for student motivation and practice activities, and includes alternative ideas in case the lesson is not long enough or is too difficult. It also notes materials needed. }}

{{defn|1=  See “language content”, and “vocabulary”. }}

{{Term|term= Listening |content= [[Listening]] }}
{{defn|1=  See “language skills”. }}

{{Term|term= Look and say }}
{{defn|1=  Also called the whole-word method, a method to teach reading to children, usually in their first language; has been adapted for second-language reading; words are taught in association with visuals or objects; students must always say the word so the teacher can monitor and correct pronunciation. }}

{{Term|term= Metalanguage |content= [[Metalanguage]] }}
{{defn|1=   Language used to describe, analyse or explain another language. Metalanguage includes, for example, grammatical terms and the rules of syntax.

{{defn|1=  Those who speak the language in question as an additional language. The language in question is not their mother tongue. }}

{{Term|term= Objectives }}
{{defn|1=  Also called lesson objectives or aims; statements of student learning outcomes based on student needs; objectives state specifically what the students will be able to do in a specified time period; objectives are measurable and therefore involve specific and discrete language skills. }}

{{Term|term= Over-correction }}
{{defn|1=  Correcting so much that students become reluctant to try out what they have learned. }}

{{Term|term= Paradox of language acquisition }}

{{Term|term= Passive vocabulary }}
{{defn|1=  Vocabulary that students have heard and can understand, but do not necessarily use when they speak or write. }}

{{Term|term= Passive }}

{{Term|term= Sociolinguistics }}
{{defn|1=  Aspects of culture that affect communication with others; examples: social class, education level, age, gender, ethnicity. Also, see “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Strategic competence }}
{{defn|1=  See “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Student and teacher }}
{{defn|1=  Teachers have eight roles in the classroom. They are authorities and sources of knowledge; entertainers; caregivers; role models; counsellors and sometimes friends; classroom disciplinarians; directors and managers; facilitators, coaches and guides.

The most important person in the classroom is the student. The teacher’s primary focus must be on effective ways to have the student practice using his or her language. Classes should be planned so they enable the student to use just a little more language than they are comfortable with. This is known as “i+1” – an idea popularized by Stephen Krashen. This formula is short for “comprehensible input plus one.” Comprehensible input is language the students can understand. }}

{{Term|term= Student feedback }}
{{defn|1=  Information solicited from students by the teacher to assess the effectiveness of the teaching-learning process. }}

{{Term|term= Student-centred }}
{{defn|1=  Also called learner-centred, a way of teaching that centres on the goals, needs, interests and existing knowledge of the students. Students actively participate in such classrooms and may even be involved in setting learning outcomes. Teachers in student-centred classrooms ask students for input on their goals, needs and interests and on what they know before providing them with study topics or answers to questions (for example, grammar rules). They may also ask students to generate (help produce) materials. The teacher is seen more as a facilitator or helper than the dominant figure in the classroom. }}

{{Term|term= Task-based syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  A syllabus organized around a sect of real, purposeful tasks that students are expected to carry out; tasks may include telephone use, making charts or maps, following instructions, and so on; task-based learning is purposeful and a natural way to learn language. }}

{{Term|term= Teachable moments }}
{{defn|1=  Times in a language class in which the teacher realizes that a point of information not in the lesson plan will help students understand a language point; teachable moments digress for a brief time from the lesson plan and can be valuable in helping student learning and keeping students engaged. }}

{{Term|term= Teacher talk }}
{{defn|1=  The language teachers use when teaching; involves simplifying speech for students; it may be detrimental to learning if it is childish or not close to the natural production of the target language. }}

{{Term|term= TEFL vs. TESL }}
{{defn|1=  TEFL is an [[acronym]] for [[Teaching English as a Foreign Language]]; TESL, for Teaching English as a Second Language. See a fuller description at [[English language learning and teaching]].  TEFL '''usually''' takes place in non-English-speaking countries, while TESL takes place in the English-speaking world. 
When we speak of English as a foreign language (EFL), we are referring to the role of English for learners in a country where English is not spoken by the majority (what [[Braj Kachru]] calls the expanding circle).  English as a second language (ESL) refers to the role of English for learners in an English-speaking country, i.e. usually [[immigrants]]. This difference is very important, because it strongly affects student motivation. In particular, it affects their motivation to learn.

	In non-English speaking countries, students have instrumental motivation, the desire to learn English to accomplish a goal. They may want to improve their job prospects, for example, or to speak to tourists. They
1.	attend English classes with other non-native speakers
2.	can find reasonable work without English; have less economic incentive to learn English.
3.	do not need English in daily life
4.	have both primary and secondary support-networks that function in their native language
5.	have fewer opportunities to practice using their English
They are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a [[foreign language]].

	In English-speaking countries, they have integrative motivation, the desire to learn the language to fit into an English-language culture. They are more likely to want to integrate because they
1.	Generally have more friends and family with English language skills.
2.	Have immediate financial and economic incentives to learn English.
3.	Have more opportunities to practice English.
4.	Need it in daily life; often require it for work.
5.	Often attend English classes with students who speak a wide range of mother tongues.
They are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a [[second language]]. }}

{{Term|term= Technique }}

{{Term|term= Uninterrupted sustained silent writing }}
{{defn|1=  A technique in writing whereby a specified, relatively short period of time is set aside in class for students to practice their writing without being interrupted. This helps build writing fluency. }}

{{Term|term= Vocabulary |content= [[Vocabulary]], importance of }}
{{defn|1=  Core vocabulary (the most common 2,000-3,000 English words) needs to be heavily stressed in language teaching. There is no point in presenting exotic vocabulary until students have mastered basic, high-frequency words. Learners should be tested on high-frequency word lists for passive knowledge, active production and listening comprehension. Learners cannot comprehend or speak at a high level without these words as a foundation.

Learners need to spend time practicing these words until they are automatic; this is known as building automaticity. Since there is often not enough class time for much word practice, teachers need to present their students with strategies for developing automaticity outside the classroom. }}

{{Term|term= Vocabulary-based syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  Syllabus built around vocabulary; often associated with the grammatical syllabus and the grammar translation method. }}

{{Term|term= Worksheets }}
{{defn|1=  Teacher-developed, paper-based activities to help students comprehend, use, and learn language; can be used in association with all skill levels and in individual and group work. }}

[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' grimoire.]]
A '''grimoire''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ɪ|m|ˈ|w|ɑr}} {{respell|grim|WAHR}}) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like [[talismans]] and [[amulets]], how to perform magical [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] and [[divination]], and how to [[evocation|summon]] or [[invocation|invoke]] supernatural entities such as [[angel]]s, [[spirits]], [[Deity|deities]] and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"&gt;Davies (2009:1)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the [[Bible]]) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all ''books on magic'' could be thought of as grimoires, not all ''magical books'' should be thought of as grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''grimoire'' is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly [[ceremonial magic]]ians and [[cunning folk]], have used grimoires, the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from [[Jamaica]] to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-5)&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is most commonly believed that the term ''grimoire'' originated from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''grammaire'', which had initially been used to refer to all books written in [[Latin]]. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because "many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

However, the term ''grimoire'' later developed into a [[figure of speech]] amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in [[occultism]] amongst the British following the publication of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett's]] ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]]'' (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===

The earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), where they have been found inscribed on [[cuneiform]] clay tablets that [[archaeology|archaeologists]] excavated from the city of [[Uruk]] and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:8)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as [[heka (god)|heka]], was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by [[Alexander the Great]], invaded Egypt in 332 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"&gt;Davies (2009:8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next three centuries of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] writing system evolved, and the [[Library of Alexandria]] was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"/&gt; Around this time the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] and the Greek [[Hermes]]; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"&gt;Davies (2009:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed that books on magic were invented by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]]. The 1st-century AD writer [[Pliny the Elder]] stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher [[Zoroaster]] around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician [[Osthanes]]. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"&gt;Davies (2009:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Hebrews|Jewish]] people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from [[Moses]], who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical [[Old Testament]]), present him as a [[polytheism|polytheist]] who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"/&gt;

Meanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], sects of [[early Christianity]]. In the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'' found within the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], for instance, there is information on [[astrology]] and the [[angels]]. In possible connection with the ''Book of Enoch'', the idea of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and his great-grandson [[Noah]] having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|quote="Many of those [in [[Ephesus]]] who believed [in Christianity] now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power."|source=[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19, c. 1st century}}

Israelite King [[Solomon]] was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of [[demonic possession|possession]]. The book may have been the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' but was more probably a different work.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=E. M.|authorlink=Eliza Marian Butler |title=Ritual Magic |year=1979 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-521-29553-X |edition=Reprint |chapter=The Solomonic Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''Testament of Solomon'' is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.

The work tells of the building of [[The Temple]] and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel [[Michael]] gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the [[Seal of Solomon]], had the power to bind [[demons]] from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the ''Testament'', he was tempted into worshiping "false gods", such as [[Moloch]], [[Baal]], and [[Rapha (god)|Rapha]]. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Christianity became the dominant faith of the [[Roman Empire]], the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with [[paganism]], and [[book burning|burned books of magic]]. The [[New Testament]] records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of [[Sceva]] became known, many converts decided to [[Book burning at Ephesus|burn their own magic and pagan books]] in the city of [[Ephesus]]; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:18-20)&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician [[Pythagoras]].

=== Medieval period ===
In the [[Medieval]] period, the production of grimoires continued in [[Christendom]], as well as amongst [[Jews]] and the followers of the newly founded [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. As the historian Owen Davies noted, "while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with "natural magic" and those that dealt in "demonic magic".&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"&gt;Davies (2009:22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]]; for instance, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the [[Devil]] and his [[demons]]. These grimoires dealt in such topics as [[necromancy]], [[divination]] and [[demonology]].&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"/&gt; Despite this, "there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,"&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:36)&lt;/ref&gt; while several grimoires were attributed to [[Popes]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'', featuring magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (or סגולות, ''seguloth'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]
One such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century ''Ghâyat al-Hakîm fi'l-sihr'', was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the ''[[Picatrix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:25-26)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century [[The Sworn Book of Honorius|''Sworn Book of Honorius'']], for instance, was (like the ancient ''Testament of Solomon'' before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king [[Solomon]] and included ideas such as prayers and a [[ritual circle]], with the [[mysticism|mystical]] purpose of having visions of God, [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew ''[[Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh]]'', translated in Europe as the ''Liber Razielis Archangeli''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the ''[[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'' or the ''Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon''. In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the ''Clavicula Salomonis'', or the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:15)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist [[Trithemius]] (1462–1516) supposedly had a ''Book of Simon the Magician'', based upon the New Testament figure of [[Simon Magus]]. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of [[Jesus Christ]]'s and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a [[satanism|devil worshiper]] and evil individual.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet [[Virgil]], astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and philosopher [[Aristotle]], had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:24)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the [[Franciscan]] friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1214–94) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors "ought to be prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:37)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
As the [[early modern period]] commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], the [[witch-hunt]]s and the advent of printing. The [[Renaissance]] saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in [[Hermeticism]] among [[occult]]ists and [[ceremonial magic]]ians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient ''Corpus hermeticum'' into Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99).

Alongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish [[mysticism]] known as the [[Kabbalah]], which was spread across the continent by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:46)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important magician of the Renaissance was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'', in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47-48)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), who published ''Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature'', in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:48)&lt;/ref&gt; A third such individual was [[Johann Georg Faust]], upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as [[Christopher Marlow]]e's ''Doctor [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Faust]]us'', that portrayed him as consulting with demons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:49-50)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[demonology]] had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including ''The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'', which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa,&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of [[exorcism]], the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:59-60)&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including ''Magia naturalis'', written by [[Giambattista Della Porta]] (1535–1615).&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:57)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pentagram and human body (Agrippa).jpg|thumb|A man inscribed in a [[pentagram]], from [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (Eng., ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). The signs on the perimeter are [[astrology|astrological]].]]

The advent of [[printing]] in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The ''nóminas'' were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:45)&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly in [[Protestant]] countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], where such grimoires were published.

Despite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:53-54)&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular [[folk magic]] of the average people and, in particular, that of the [[cunning folk]], who were professionally involved in folk magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:66-67)&lt;/ref&gt; These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires and the parts of North America controlled by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:84-90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the [[Inquisition]], a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered [[heresy|heretical]]. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:54-55)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1599, the church published the ''Indexes of Prohibited Books'', in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which were still popular.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of [[witchcraft]], which was believed to be [[Satanism|Satanic]] in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Witch Hunt]], caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women.&lt;ref name="Patrick 2007 p. 802"&gt;{{cite book | last=Patrick | first=J. | title=Renaissance and Reformation | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7614-7650-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JDOVMDi8d4C&amp;pg=PA802 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate [[Iceland]] proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:70-73)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of [[the Enlightenment]], many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.

Meanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as [[Rosicrucianism]], which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Emperor [[Lucifer]], master of all the [[fallen angel|rebel spirits]], I beg you to favour me in the call that I am making to your grand minister LUCIFUGÉ ROFOCALE, desiring to make a pact with him; I beg you also, prince [[Beelzebub]] to protect me in my undertaking. O count [[Astaroth|Astarot]]! Be favourable to me, and make it so that this night the grand Lucifege appears to me in human form, and without any bad odour, and that he accords to me, by the pact that I am going to present to him, all the riches I need."|source= From the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]''.}}

The 18th century saw the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a movement devoted to [[science]] and [[rationalism]], predominantly amongst the ruling classes. However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as did the witch trials in certain{{which|date=August 2012}} areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for [[treasure]]. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new form of printing developed in France, the ''[[Bibliothèque bleue]]''. Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} of the populace, in particular the ''Grand Albert'', the ''[[Petit Albert]]'' (1782), the ''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' and the ''[[Grimoire of Pope Leo|Enchiridion Leonis Papae]]''. The ''Petit Albert'' contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a [[Hand of Glory]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:98-101)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'', which was considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}} particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, [[Lucifuge Rofocale|Lucifugé Rofocale]], to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the ''Dragon rouge'' and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:101-104)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar books published in France at the time included the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' and the ''[[Grimoirium Verum]]''. The ''Black Pullet'', probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of [[Napoleon]]'s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |title=grimoire |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2006 |isbn= 1-4381-3000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread availability of printed grimoires in France—despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church—soon{{when|date=August 2012}} spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, [[Geneva]] was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:109-110)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the ''Libro de San Cipriano'', or ''The Book of St. Ciprian'', which falsely claimed to date from c.&amp;nbsp;1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:114-115)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sixthandseventhbooks frontpiece 1880.png|thumb|The title page of the 1880 New York edition of ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses''.]]

In Germany, with the increased interest in [[folklore]] during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779–1832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:121-122)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'' were among the works that later spread to the countries of [[Scandinavia]], where, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], grimoires were known as [[Cyprianus|black books]] and were commonly found among members of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:134-136)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as [[Ebenezer Sibly]]'s ''A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology''. In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] published ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' in 1801. ''The Magus'' contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123-124)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, ''The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic'', although it was never published, largely because Britain [[Napoleonic wars|was at war with France]], and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released ''The Philosophical Merlin'' (1822) and ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century'' (1825), but neither sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:135-137)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, several of these texts (including ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'' and the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'') were reclaimed by para-[[Masonic]] magical organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
''[[The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malchus |first= Marius |title= The Secret Grimoire of Turiel |publisher= Theophania Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-926842-80-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern grimoire, the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]], inspired by [[Babylonian mythology]] and by the "[[Ars Goetia]]", a section in the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' that concerns the summoning of demons. The ''Azoëtia'' of [[Andrew D.

The [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] publicly appeared in the 1940s, and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] introduced the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' as a Wiccan grimoire.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite journal |title= Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires  |journal= [[The Guardian]]  |date= 4 April 2008|last= Davies |first= Owen |authorlink= Owen Davies (historian) |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history |accessdate= 2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], headmaster of the [[Grey School of Wizardry]], wrote and compiled the school's ''Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page, 2004) and the sequel ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page 2006).&lt;ref name=Myash2011&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in [[fantasy fiction]] and [[role-playing games]]. The most famous fictional grimoire is the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', a creation of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

'''Historicism''' or also '''historism''' ({{lang-de|Historismus}}) comprises artistic styles that draw their inspiration from recreating historic styles or imitating the work of historic artisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward]]. ''The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1988, p. 100. {{ISBN|0-500-20222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as [[revival architecture]]. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus it offers a great variety of possible designs.

In the [[history of art]], after [[Neoclassicism]] which in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked by an interpretation not only of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[classicism]], but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of [[history painting]], in which historical subjects were treated of with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. By the end of the century, in the ''[[fin de siècle]]'', [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Art Nouveau]] followed by [[Expressionism (architecture)|Expressionism]] and [[Modernism]] acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles.

Influences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries. When [[postmodern architecture]] became widely popular in the 1980s, a movement of [[Neo-Historism]] followed, that is still prominent and can be found around the world, especially in [[Representation (arts)|representative]] and upper-class buildings.

'''Humanistic naturalism''' is the branch of [[philosophical naturalism]] wherein [[human beings]] are best able to control and understand the world through use of the [[scientific method]], combined with the social and ethical values of [[humanism]]. Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and [[metaphysics]] are considered [[subjectivity|subjectively]] valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress beyond the realm of personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between [[nature]] and what lies "beyond" nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside it.&lt;ref&gt;'' Living Issues in Philosophy'' (4th ed.; New York: American Book Co., 1963): 215-221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the need for adaptation to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of "worldview naturalism."&lt;ref&gt;''What is Humanism'' (American Humanist Association)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Industry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and [[hunter-gatherer]] and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with [[anarcho-primitivism]] and other anti-modernist perspectives.

'''''ITL International Journal of Applied Linguistics''''' is a [[Peer review|refereed]] [[Academic journal|journal]] that welcomes manuscripts in the broad area of [[applied linguistics]], particularly  contributions relating to [[language acquisition]] (second language acquisition and foreign/second language teaching, including computer-assisted learning) and educational linguistics. The journal publishes reports of empirical studies and  theoretical articles; each issue also includes book reviews. The journal is published twice a year by the Department of Linguistics at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|K.U.Leuven]], the Department of Applied Linguistics of the [[Vlekho|VLEKHO]] ([[Brussels]]) and the Department of Applied Linguistics of the [[Lessius Hogeschool]] ([[Antwerp]]). The name ITL refers to the center of applied linguistics at the K.U.Leuven where the journal was founded (Instituut voor Toegepaste Linguïstiek). The journal has recently merged with ''Interface, Journal of Applied Linguistics'', formerly published by the Department of Applied Linguistics (VLEKHO, Brussels), and now bears the name ''ITL International Journal of Applied Linguistics''.

The '''Institute of Economic Affairs''' ('''IEA''') is a non-profit, [[right-wing libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Westminster]], London, United Kingdom. Founded by businessman and [[battery farming]] pioneer [[Antony Fisher]] in 1955, it promotes [[free market]] economics. There has been discussion in the press and among parliamentarians as to whether the IEA is more accurately described as a [[lobbying]] operation than as a think tank.&lt;ref name=obs11nov18&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-taxpayers-alliance-concedes-it-launched-smears|title=TaxPayers' Alliance concedes it launched smears against Brexit whistleblower|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=11 November 2018|newspaper=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It publishes a magazine, books, and holds lectures regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/adam-ramsay-peter-geoghegan/right-wing-think-tank-accused-of-promoting-tobacco-oil-indu|title=Right-wing think tank accused of promoting tobacco and oil industry “propaganda” in schools|last1=Ramsay|first1=Adam|last2=Geoghegan|first2=Peter|date=28 November 2018|publisher=openDemocracy|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1945, [[Antony Fisher]] read a summary of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' by [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref name="ieachronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/Chronology.pdf|title=IEA: Chronology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Fisher visited Hayek at the London School of Economics.  Hayek dissuaded Fisher from embarking on a political and parliamentary career to try to prevent the spread of socialism and [[central planning]].&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Instead, Hayek suggested the establishment of a body which could engage in research and reach the intellectuals with reasoned argument.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;

In June 1955, ''The Free Convertibility of Sterling'' by George Winder was published, with Fisher signing the foreword as Director of the IEA.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; In November 1955, the IEA's Original Trust Deed was signed by Fisher, John Harding and [[Oliver Smedley]]. [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] (later Lord Harris) began work as part-time General Director in January 1957.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; He was joined in 1958 by [[Arthur Seldon]] who was initially appointed Editorial Advisor and became the Editorial Director in 1959.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Smedley wrote to Fisher that it was &lt;blockquote&gt;"imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. … That is why the first draft [of the IEA’s aims] is written in rather cagey terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/fdb484c8-99a1-32a3-83be-20108374b985 |title=THE CURSE OF TINA |website=BBC |date=13 September 2011  |author=Adam Curtis |accessdate= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Social Affairs Unit]] was established in December 1980 as an offshoot of the Institute of Economic Affairs to carry the IEA's economic ideas onto the battleground of sociology.&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt; "Within a few years the Social Affairs Unit became independent from the IEA, acquiring its own premises."&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Christopher |title=The Institute of Economic Affairs: Undermining the Post-War Consensus |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=88–110 [p. 102] |doi=10.1080/13619469608581370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the IEA created a Health and Welfare Unit to focus on these aspects of social policy.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt; Discussing the IEA's increasing influence under the Conservative government in the 1980s in relation to the "advent of Thatcherism" and the promotion of privatisation, Dieter Plehwe, a Research Fellow at the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]], has written that&lt;blockquote&gt;The arguably most influential think tank in British history... benefited from the close alignment of IEA's [[neoliberal]] agenda with [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] and the priorities of the Thatcher government.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Identities – Academic Challenges? American and European Experience of the Transformation of Higher Education and Research, Dieter Plehwe, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011, pp. 172–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, British journalist [[Andrew Marr]] called the IEA "undoubtedly the most influential think tank in modern British history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=New Britannia|series=[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain]]|publisher=[[BBC One]]|episode=5|airdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damien Cahill, a Professor of Political Economy at the [[University of Sydney]], has characterised the IEA as, "Britain's oldest and leading neoliberal think tank".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=GKAiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Institute+of+Economic+Affairs%22,+%22neoliberal+think+tank%22&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=If52VeO2Oui5mAWj1IPQAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Institute%20of%20Economic%20Affairs%22%2C%20%22neoliberal%20think%20tank%22&amp;f=false The End of Laissez-Faire?: On the Durability of Embedded Neoliberalism] Damien Cahill, Edward Elgar Pub, 2014, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the IEA appointed Mark Littlewood as its Director General with effect from 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="cherwell"&gt;Robert Walmsley, [http://www.cherwell.org/comment/interviews/2014/01/25/interview-mark-littlewood Interview: Mark Littlewood], ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'', 26 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and aims==
It is not known what the IEA actually is, or on whose behalf it speaks, or how it is funded. It is rated by the accountability group Transparify&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparify.org/ |title=Transparify |website=Transparify.org |date=17 July 2018  |author= |accessdate= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "highly opaque". &lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

It has supported legislation banning charities receiving public funds from lobbying the government (this does not affect IEA itself; as a registered educational charity it is exempt from many taxes, but its funding is private). Charity Commission rules state that "an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political". In July 2018 the Charity Commission announced that it was to investigate whether the IEA had broken its rules.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

Since Britain voted to leave the [[European Union]] ([[Brexit]]) by March 2019, the IEA has lobbied consistently for a [[Brexit#Hard and soft Brexit|hard Brexit]] without customs and regulatory alignment, etc.; a report it published in July 2018 proposed using Brexit to remove rules protecting agency workers, to deregulate finance, annul the rules on hazardous chemicals and weaken food labelling laws.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

The IEA supports privatising the [[National Health Service]] (NHS); campaigns against controls on junk food; attacks trades unions; and defends [[zero-hour contract]]s, unpaid internships and tax havens.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt; Its staff frequently appear on BBC television promoting these positions.

Its director Mark Littlewood said "We want to totally reframe the debate about the proper role of the state and civil society in our country … Our true mission is to change the climate of opinion."&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;
===Concerns about political independence; investigation===

[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]] and [[Martin Callanan|Lord Callanan]], ministers at the [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] (DExEU) at the time, all recorded meetings with the IEA in the first three months of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720640/-DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv_-_COMPLETE_2018-12-06_DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv.csv/preview |title=Ministerial meetings, January to March 2018|website=UK Government, Department for Exiting the European Union  |author= |date= 28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Observer'' reported on 29 July 2018 that the director of the IEA was secretly recorded in May and June telling an undercover reporter that funders could get to know ministers on first-name terms and that his organisation was in "the Brexit influencing game". While seeking funding, Littlewood said that the IEA allowed donors to affect the "salience" of reports and to shape "substantial content". The recording was to be given to the Charity Commission on 30 July.&lt;ref name=obs29jul18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/29/rightwing-thinktank-ministerial-access-potential-us-donors-insitute-of-economic-affairs-brexit |title=Rightwing UK thinktank 'offered ministerial access' to potential US donors |newspaper=The Observer|author= Robert Booth|date= 29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charity Commission, considering that the allegations raised by the recordings were “of a serious nature”, on 20 July 2018  opened a regulatory compliance case into the IEA due to concerns about its political independence, after it became known that it offered potential US donors access to ministers while raising funds for research to promote free-trade deals favoured by proponents of a "hard Brexit". The Commission has powers to examine IEA financial records, legally compel it to provide information, and to disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law.&lt;ref name=graun30jl18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/labour-calls-for-inquiry-into-iea-thinktank-over-cash-for-access-claims |title=Thinktank faces double investigation after 'cash for access' claims |newspaper=The Guardian|author=Robert Booth and  Rajeev Syal|date= 30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lobbying in the United Kingdom#Regulation|register of lobbyists]] was also considering whether the IEA should be registered. It was also revealed that, after the IEA published a report recommending more [[casino]]s, the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA.&lt;ref name=graun30jl18/&gt;

[[Jon Trickett]], the [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] [[Cabinet Office]] minister, welcoming the investigation into the IEA, said "on the road to Brexit, a small group of establishment figures, funded to the tune of millions, are covertly pursuing a political campaign in favour of extreme free trade, acting in effect as lobbyists for secretive corporate interests. ... there are serious questions that high-ranking Conservative ministers must now answer about their dealings with the IEA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/charity-commission-investigation-institute-economic-affairs |title=This thinktank scandal is another sign that our democracy is under attack |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Jon Trickett |date= 31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also revealed that Jersey Finance, representing financial interests in [[Jersey]], paid for an IEA report saying that  tax havens (such as Jersey) benefited the wider economy, and did not diminish tax  revenues in other countries. The report recommended that their status be protected. The IEA did not disclose the funding from Jersey Finance. A similar IEA report about neighbouring [[Guernsey]] was funded by the financial services industry there. Following these revelations, the IEA said that funding they received never influenced the conclusions of reports, and that their output was independent and free from conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/31/jersey-finance-paid-iea-to-trash-hotbeds-of-tax-evasion-claims |title=Jersey Finance paid for IEA report rubbishing 'hotbeds of tax evasion' claims |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Robert Booth and  David Pegg|date= 31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The IEA is a registered educational and research charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|235351|The Institute of Economic Affairs Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation states that it is entirely funded by "voluntary donations from individuals, companies and foundations who want to support its work, plus income from book sales and conferences"&lt;ref name=IEA-about /&gt; and that it is "independent of any political party or group".&lt;ref name=IEA-about /&gt; The IEA's sources of funding are not known, except that there has been long-term funding by [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT), [[Japan Tobacco International]], [[Imperial Tobacco]] and [[Philip Morris International]].&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt; The IEA has written policy papers arguing against government funding for pressure groups and charities involved in political campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snowden|first1=Christopher|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why|publisher=IEA Discussion Paper 39|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding from multinational tobacco, alcohol and food corporations===
The IEA does not disclose their sources of funding but has been criticised by health charities and ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name=graun18jl18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/dark-money-democracy-political-crisis-institute-economic-affairs |title=Dark money lurks at the heart of our political crisis |newspaper=The Guardian |author=George Monbiot |date= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for receiving funds from major tobacco companies whilst campaigning on tobacco related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/cigarette-packaging-corporate-smokescreen-liberty | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cigarette packaging: the corporate smokescreen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British American Tobacco]] confirmed it had donated £40,000 to the IEA in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British American Tobacco's response to ASH – June 2014|url=http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__9d9kcy.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO9DLM9T/$FILE/medMD9KSF99.pdf?openelement|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; £20,000 in 2012 and £10,000 in 2011 and [[Philip Morris International]] and [[Japan Tobacco International]] also confirmed they had provided financial support to the IEA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/01/thinktanks-big-tobacco-funds-smoking Health groups dismayed by news 'big tobacco' funded rightwing thinktanks], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a leaked letter revealed that prominent IEA member, the conservative writer [[Roger Scruton]], had authored an IEA pamphlet attacking the World Health Organisation's campaign on tobacco, whilst failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from Japan Tobacco International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/24/advertising.tobaccoadvertising | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Scruton in media plot to promote smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-tobacco writer admits he should have declared an interest|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/324/7332/257.1.full|website=British Medical Journal|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the IEA said it would introduce an author declaration policy.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt; The IEA says that it "accepts no tied funding".&lt;ref name="peer review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peer Review Protocol|url=https://iea.org.uk/peer-review-protocal/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201175327/http://www.iea.org.uk:80/publications/peer-review-protocol|archive-date=1 February 2016|dead-url=no|website=IEA|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation called 'American Friends of the IEA' had received $215,000 as of 2010 from the US-based [[Donors Trust]] and [[Donors Capital Fund]], [[donor-advised fund]]s which support right-wing libertarian causes.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/18/charities-pr-rightwing-ultra-rich | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=The educational charities that do PR for the rightwing ultra-rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Think tank [[Transparify]], which is funded by the [[Open Society Foundations]], ranked the IEA as one of the three least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding.&lt;ref name="sarahneville"&gt;Sarah Neville, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6968c4-b5ec-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3SekS8nmf British think-tanks ‘less transparent about sources of funding’], ''Financial Times'', 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t2015 /&gt; The IEA responded by saying "...It is a matter for individual donors whether they wish their donation to be public or private – we leave that entirely to their discretion.", and that it has not "...earmarked money for commissioned research work from any company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neville|first1=Sarah|title=British think-tanks 'less transparent about sources of funding'|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6968c4-b5ec-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding to the IEA from the alcohol industry, food industry, and sugar industry has also been documented.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Impact of Market Forces on Addictive Substances and Behaviours: The web of influence of addictive industries.|last=Miller|first=David|last2=Harkins|first2=Claire|last3=Schlögl|first3=Matthias|last4=Montague|first4=Brendan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780198753261|location=Oxford|pages=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEA Research Fellow [[Christopher Snowdon]] disclosed alcohol industry funding in a response to a British Medical Journal article in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==

Arthur Seldon proposed a series of Papers for economists to explore the market approach to the issues of the day.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Eventually these emerged as the Hobart Papers; 154 had been published by August 2006. In addition, 32 Hobart Paperbacks had been released along with 139 Occasional Papers, 61 Readings and 61 Research Monographs.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; A large number of other titles has been published in association with trade and university presses.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;

''The Journal of Economic Affairs'' was first published in October 1980 and continues to be published to the present day. IEA publications are sold throughout the world – reprinted and translated into over twenty-five languages. In the UK, many IEA titles have become mandatory in university and classroom reading lists.&lt;ref name="IEA-about"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iea.org.uk/about|title = about the IEA|publisher = Institute of Economic Affairs|accessdate = 29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEA papers are arranged in a series of titles, each with its own 'brand image'. The main series of publications is complemented by the IEA's quarterly journal ''Economic Affairs''.

In September 2008, the institute started the IEA blog.

===Research===
According to the IEA, although not an academic body, the institute's research activities are aided by an international Academic Advisory Council and a panel of Honorary Fellows. The IEA say that their papers are subjected to the same refereeing process used by academic journals&lt;ref name="peer review" /&gt;, and that the views expressed in IEA papers are those of the authors and not of the IEA, its trustees, directors or advisers.

The IEA has also published research in areas including  business ethics, economic development, education, pensions, regulation, taxation and transport.

'''Lyrical abstraction''' is either of two related but distinct [[art movement|trends]] in [[Post-war]] [[Modernist]] painting:

''European Abstraction Lyrique'' born in Paris, the French art critic [[Jean José Marchand]] being credited with coining its name in 1947, considered as a component of ([[Tachisme]]) when the name of this movement was coined in 1951 by Pierre Guéguen and Charles Estienne the author of ''L'Art à Paris 1945–1966'', and ''American Lyrical Abstraction'' a movement described by [[Larry Aldrich]] (the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut) in 1969. &lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qOYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=thomas+Hess+on+Larry+Aldrich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O3uy5XJycw&amp;sig=ik9HafuHWYLDjGimUNTuvBLJjcs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SVsQTLXiHMLflgecx7WxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20Hess%20on%20Larry%20Aldrich&amp;f=false] Thomas B. Hess on Larry Aldrich, Retrieved June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A third definition is the usage as a descriptive term. It is a descriptive term characterizing a type of abstract painting related to Abstract Expressionism; in use since the 1940s. Many well known abstract expressionist painters like [[Arshile Gorky]] seen in context have been characterized as doing a type of painting described as lyrical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/exhibitions/3426 Kemper Museum] Retrieved June 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/bellam63.htm interview with Richard Bellamy, 1963, Archives of American Art, retrieved February 1st, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The original common use refers to the tendency attributed to paintings in Europe during the post-1945 period and as a way of describing several artists (mostly in France) with painters like [[Wols]], [[Gérard Schneider]] and [[Hans Hartung]] from Germany or [[Georges Mathieu]], etc., whose works related to characteristics of contemporary American abstract expressionism. At the time (late 1940s), [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]] and numerous other American artists were, as well, living and working in Paris and other European cities. With the exception of Kelly, all of those artists developed their versions of painterly abstraction that has been characterized at times as lyrical abstraction, [[tachisme]], [[color field]], [[Nuagisme]] and [[abstract expressionism]].

The [[art movement]] ''Abstraction lyrique'' was born in [[Paris]] after the war. At that time, the artistic life in Paris, which had been devastated by the [[military occupation|Occupation]] and [[Collaboration]], resumed with numerous artists exhibited again as soon as the Liberation of Paris in mid-1944. According to the new abstraction forms that characterised some artists, the movement was named by the [[art critic]], Jean José Marchand, and the painter, Georges Mathieu, in 1947. Some art critics also looked at this movement as an attempt to restore the image of artistic Paris, which had held the rank of capital of the arts until the war.  Lyrical abstraction also represented a competition between the [[School of Paris]] and the new [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of [[Abstract Expressionism]] painting represented above all since 1946 by [[Jackson Pollock]], then [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Mark Rothko]], which were also promoted by the American authorities from the early 1950s.

Lyrical abstraction was opposed not only to the [[Cubist]] and [[Surrealist]] movements that preceded it, but also to [[geometric abstraction]] (or "cold abstraction"). Lyrical abstraction was, in some ways, the first to apply the lessons of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], considered one of the fathers of abstraction. For the artists, lyrical abstraction represented an opening to personal expression.

Finally, in the late 1960s (partially as a response to [[minimal art]], and the dogmatic interpretations by some to [[Clement Greenberg|Greenbergian]] and [[Donald Judd|Juddian]] [[Formalism (art)|formalism]]), many painters re-introduced painterly options into their works and the Whitney Museum and several other museums and institutions at the time formally named and identified the movement and uncompromising return to painterly abstraction as 'lyrical abstraction'.

==European ''abstraction lyrique''==
Just after [[World War II]], many artists old and young were back in Paris where they worked and exhibited: [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[André Lanskoy]] and Zaks from Russia; [[Hans Hartung]] and [[Wols]] from Germany; [[Árpád Szenes]], [[Endre Rozsda]] and [[Simon Hantaï]] from Hungary; [[Alexandre Istrati]] from Romania; [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] from Canada; [[Vieira da Silva]] from Portugal; [[Gérard Ernest Schneider]] from Switzerland; Feito from Spain; [[Bram van Velde]] from the Netherlands; [[Albert Bitran]] from Turkey; [[Zao Wou-Ki]] from China; Sugai from Japan; [[Sam Francis]], John Franklin Koenig, Jack Youngerman and [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]] from the U.S.A.

All these artists and many others were at that time among the "Lyrical Abstractionists" with the French: [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Pierre Soulages]], Nallard, [[Jean René Bazaine]], Jacques Doucet, Camille Bryen, [[Jean Le Moal]], [[Gustave Singier]], [[Alfred Manessier]], [[Roger Bissière]], [[Pierre Tal-Coat]], [[Jean Messagier]] and others.

Lyrical Abstraction was opposed not only to "l’Ecole de Paris" remains of pre-war style but to [[Cubist]] and [[Surrealist]] movements that had preceded it, and also to [[geometric abstraction]] (or "Cold Abstraction"). For the artists in France, Lyrical Abstraction represented an opening to personal expression. In [[Belgium]], [[Louis Van Lint]] figured a remarkable example of an artist who, after a short period of geometric abstraction, has moved to a lyrical abstraction in which he excelled.

Many exhibitions were held in Paris for example in the galleries Arnaud, Drouin, Jeanne Bucher, Louis Carré, Galerie de France, and every year at the "Salon des Réalités Nouvelles" and "Salon de Mai" where the paintings of all these artists could be seen. At the Drouin gallery one could see Jean Le Moal, [[Gustave Singier]], [[Alfred Manessier]], Roger Bissière, [[Wols]] and others. A wind blew over the capital when [[Georges Mathieu]] decided to hold two exhibitions: ''L'Imaginaire'' in 1947 at the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] which he would have prefer to call ''abstraction lyrique'' to impose the name and then ''HWPSMTB'' with ([[Hans Hartung]], [[Wols]], [[Francis Picabia]], François Stahly sculptor, Georges Mathieu, [[Michel Tapié]] and Camille Bryen) in 1948.
 
In March 1951 was held the larger exhibition ''Véhémences confrontées'' in the gallery Nina Dausset where for the first time were presented side to side French and American abstract artists. It was organised by the critic [[Michel Tapié]], whose role in the defense of this movement was of the highest importance. With these events, he déclared that « the lyrical abstraction is born ».

It was, however, a fairly short reign (late 1957), which was quickly supplanted by the [[New Realism]] of [[Pierre Restany]] and [[Yves Klein]].

Starting around 1970, this movement has been revived by a new generation of artists born during or immediately after the Second World War. Some of its key promoters include Paul Kallos, Georges Romathier, Michelle Desterac, and [[Thibaut de Reimpré]].

An exhibition entitled "The Lyrical Flight, Paris 1945–1956" (''L'Envolée Lyrique, Paris 1945–1956''), bringing together the works of 60 painters, was presented in Paris at the Musée du Luxembourg from April to August 2006 and included the most prominent painters of the movement: [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Gérard Ernest Schneider|Gérard Schneider]], [[Zao Wou-Ki]], [[Albert Bitran]], [[Serge Poliakoff]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lyrical Flight, Paris 1945–1956, texts Patrick-Gilles Persin, Michel and Pierre Descargues Ragon, Musée du Luxembourg, Paris and Skira, Milan, 2006, 280 p. {{ISBN|88-7624-679-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Lyrical Abstraction''' is an [[art movement]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction: Color and Mood,'' [[Sheldon Museum of Art]], exhibition review "New Exhibit goes big, bold" ''[[Lincoln Journal-Star]]'', Sunday, May 30th, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, DC]], and then [[Toronto]] and [[London]] during the 1960s–1970s.  Characterized by intuitive and loose paint handling, spontaneous expression, illusionist space, acrylic staining, process, occasional imagery, and other painterly and newer technological techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Dore. Young Abstract Painters: Right On! Arts v. 44, n. 4, February, 1970, pp. 31–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction led the way away from [[minimalism]] in painting and toward a new freer [[expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, ''Art News'', v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Painters who directly reacted against the predominating [[Formalism (art)|Formalist]], [[Minimalist]], and [[Pop Art]] and [[geometric abstraction]] styles of the 1960s, turned to new, experimental, loose, painterly, expressive, pictorial and abstract painting styles.  Many of them had been Minimalists, working with various monochromatic, geometric styles, and whose paintings publicly evolved into new abstract painterly motifs. American Lyrical Abstraction is related in spirit to [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color Field painting]] and [[Europe]]an [[Tachisme]] of the 1940s and 1950s as well. [[Tachisme]] refers to the French style of abstract painting current in the 1945–1960 period. Very close to [[Art Informel]], it presents the European equivalent to [[Abstract Expressionism]].

The [[Sheldon Museum of Art]] held an exhibition from 1 June until 29 August 1993 entitled ''Lyrical Abstraction: Color and Mood''. Some of the participants included [[Dan Christensen]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cleve Gray]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Robert Natkin]], William Pettet, [[Mark Rothko]], Lawrence Stafford, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and several other painters. At the time the museum issued a statement the read in part:

"As a movement, Lyrical Abstraction extended the post-war [[Modernist]] aesthetic and provided a new dimension within the abstract tradition which was clearly indebted to [[Jackson Pollock]]'s "dripped painting" and [[Mark Rothko]]'s stained, color forms. This movement was born out of a desire to create a direct physical and sensory experience of painting through their monumentality and emphasis on color – forcing the viewer to "read" paintings literally as things."&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Lincoln, Sheldon Museum of Art, May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2009 the [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]] in Florida hosted an exhibition entitled ''Expanding Boundaries: Lyrical Abstraction Selections from the Permanent Collection''

At the time the museum issued a statement that said in part:

"Lyrical Abstraction arose in the 1960s and 70s, following the challenge of Minimalism and Conceptual art. Many artists began moving away from geometric, hard-edge, and minimal styles, toward more lyrical, sensuous, romantic abstractions worked in a loose gestural style. These "lyrical abstractionists" sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting, and to revive and reinvigorate a painterly 'tradition' in American art. At the same time, these artists sought to reinstate the primacy of line and color as formal elements in works composed according to aesthetic principles – rather than as the visual representation of sociopolitical realities or philosophical theories."

"Characterized by intuitive and loose paint handling, spontaneous expression, illusionist space, acrylic staining, process, occasional imagery, and other painterly techniques, the abstract works included in this exhibition sing with rich fluid color and quiet energy. Works by the following artists associated with Lyrical Abstraction will be included: [[Natvar Bhavsar]], [[Stanley Boxer]], Lamar Briggs, [[Dan Christensen]], [[David Diao]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Sam Francis]], Dorothy Gillespie, [[Cleve Gray]], [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Pat Lipsky]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Robert Natkin]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Larry Poons]], Garry Rich, [[John Seery]], Jeff Way and [[Larry Zox]]." &lt;ref name="bocamuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.bocamuseum.org/index.php?category=Exhibitions&amp;link=ExhibitionArchive&amp;src=gendocs ''Expanding Boundaries: Lyrical Abstraction: Selections from the Permanent Collection''], [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]], retrieved June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term in America===
Lyrical Abstraction, an exhibition in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], May 25–July 6, 1971 was described by John I. H. Baur, curator of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971, "Foreword by John I. H. Baur"&lt;/ref&gt;

:"To be given an entire exhibition surveying a current trend in American art at a single blow is an experience unusual to the verge of the bizarre…Mr. Aldrich defines the trend of Lyrical Abstraction and explains how he came to acquire the works…"

Lyrical Abstraction was the title of a circulating exhibition which commenced at the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]], [[Connecticut]] from April 5 through June 7, 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316858273&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, May 25 through July 6, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a term that was used by Larry Aldrich (the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut) in 1969 to describe what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitewallmag.com/2010/05/11/john-seery-new-work/ Interview with John Seery 2010, ''Whitewall Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Aldrich, a successful designer and art collector, defined the trend of Lyrical Abstraction and explained how he came to acquire the works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316858273&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction,''] exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970. ‘’Statement of the exhibition"&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Statement of the Exhibition" he wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Early last season, it became apparent that in painting there was a movement away from the geometric, hard-edge, and minimal, toward more lyrical, sensuous, romantic abstractions in colors which were softer and more vibrant…The artist's touch is always visible in this type of painting, even when the paintings are done with spray guns, sponges or other objects...As I researched this lyrical trend, I found many young artists whose paintings appealed to me so much that I was impelled to acquire many of them. The majority of the paintings in the ''Lyrical Abstraction'' exhibition were created in 1969 and all are a part of my collection now."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Larry Aldrich donated the paintings from the exhibition to the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154498&amp;referer=brief_results ''Lyrical Abstraction], exhibition: May 25 through July 6, 1971, "Foreword by John I. H. Baur"&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the term Lyrical Abstraction was a pejorative, which unfortunately adversely affected those artists whose works were associated with that name. In 1989 [[Union College]] art history professor, the late [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] observed that Lyrical Abstraction was the term used in the late sixties to describe the return to painterly expressivity by painters all over the country and "consequently", Robbins said, "the term should be used today because it has historical credibility"&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Daniel.

==Relation to other tendencies==
[[File:Spiked Red.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pat Lipsky]], ''Spiked Red,'' 1970. Her work was included in the Lyrical Abstraction exhibition at the Whitney Museum in 1970 and at the Boca Raton Museum in 2009.]]
Lyrical Abstraction along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;   sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. [[Postminimalism]] often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of [[Fluxus]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color Field]] [[Painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal Art]], [[Op art]], [[Pop Art]], [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, ''Newsweek'' 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general. Characterized by an overall gestalt, consistent surface tension, sometimes even the hiding of brushstrokes, and an overt avoidance of relational composition. It developed as did [[Postminimalism]] as an alternative to strict [[Formalism (art)|Formalist]] and [[Minimalist]] doctrine. 

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with [[Color Field]] [[Painting]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface, an example is illustrated by the painting by [[Ronnie Landfield]] entitled ''For William Blake''. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Color Field]] [[Painting]]. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Action Painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[Action Painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. The differences with [[Color Field]] [[Painting]] are more subtle today because many of the Color Field painters like [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Sam Francis]], and [[Jack Bush]] &lt;ref name="jbush"&gt;"[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/canadian/Jack-Bush.html Jack Bush]". The Art History Archive; Canadian Art. Retrieved December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of [[Morris Louis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Paul Feeley, Thomas Downing, and [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] evolved into Lyrical Abstractionists. Lyrical Abstraction shares with both [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Color Field]] Painting a sense of spontaneous and immediate sensual expression, consequently distinctions between specific artists and their styles become blurred, and seemingly interchangeable as they evolve.

By the mid-1950s, Richard Diebenkorn abandoned [[abstract expressionism]] and along with [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]] and several others formed the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] with a return to Figurative painting. During the period between the fall 1964 and the spring of 1965 Diebenkorn traveled throughout Europe, he was granted a cultural visa to visit and view Henri Matisse paintings in important Soviet museums. He traveled to the then Soviet Union to study [[Henri Matisse]] paintings in Russian museums that were rarely seen outside of Russia. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965 his resulting works summed up all that he had learned from his more than a decade as a leading figurative painter.&lt;ref name="Jane56"&gt;Livingston, Jane. ''The Art of [[Richard Diebenkorn]]''. 1997-1998 Exhibition catalog. In ''The Art of Richard Diebenkorn'', [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. 56. {{ISBN|0-520-21257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1967 he returned to abstraction his works were parallel to movements like the [[Color Field]] movement and Lyrical Abstraction.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/obituaries/richard-diebenkorn-lyrical-painter-dies-at-71.html ''NY Times'' obituary ''Richard Diebenkorn Lyrical Painter Dies at 71'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, English painter [[John Hoyland]]'s [[Color field]] paintings were characterised by simple rectangular shapes, high-key color and a flat picture surface. In the 1970s his paintings became more textured.&lt;ref name=stives/&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, he showed his paintings in [[New York City]] with the Robert Elkon Gallery and the [[André Emmerich]] Gallery. His paintings were closely aligned with [[Post-Painterly Abstraction]], Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction.&lt;ref name="sbma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web|title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960-1979|year=2010|publisher=Santa Barbara Museum of Art|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstract Expressionism]] preceded [[Color Field painting]], Lyrical Abstraction, [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], and the other movements of the 1960s and 1970s and it influenced the later movements that evolved. The interrelationship of/and between distinct but related styles resulted in influence that worked both ways between artists young and old, and vice versa. During the mid-1960s in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere artists often crossed the lines between definitions  and art styles. During that period – the mid-1960s through the 1970s advanced American art and contemporary art in general was at a crossroad, shattering in several directions. During the 1970s political movements and revolutionary changes in communication made these American styles international; as the art world itself became more and more international. American Lyrical Abstraction's [[Europe]]an counterpart [[Neo-expressionism]] came to dominate the 1980s, and also developed as a response to American [[Pop Art]] and [[Minimalism]] and borrows heavily from American [[Abstract Expressionism]].

'''Media ethics''' is the subdivision of [[applied ethics]] dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of [[mass media|media]], including [[broadcast media]], [[film]], [[theatre]], the [[arts]], [[print media]] and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from [[War correspondent|war journalism]] to [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ad campaigns.

Media ethics involves promoting and defending values such as a universal respect for life and  the rule of law and legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moldovan|first=Gratian|date=|title=Media Ethics in the Ideological Context of the Twentieth Century|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=b975b2a4-ca3c-4480-9425-5f5ed6a3ec10%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice|volume=6|pages=589–593|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuze I, Yeshua II|first=Mark I, Daphna II|date=December 2001|title=Online Journalists Face New Ethical Dilemmas: Lessons From The Netherlands|url=|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=16|pages=273–292|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Media Ethics ==
Research and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Thomas|date=December 2004|title=A Brief History of Information Ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|journal=Universitat de Barcelona. Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), [[Rafael Capurro]], Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article "''“Ethics in Information Science”'' , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the term "information ethics" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's ''The Principles of Information Ethics'' and Marsha Cook Woodbury's ''Computer and Information Ethics'', and Deborah G. Johnson's ''Computer Ethics'' were published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of Media Ethics ==

Media ethics:  Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular [[journalism ethics and standards]] and [[marketing ethics]];  also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as [[impartiality]], [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], [[wikt:balance|balance]], [[bias]], privacy, and the [[public interest]]. More generally, it also includes [[stereotyping]], taste and decency, [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], advertising practices such as [[product placement]], and legal issues such as [[defamation]]. On an institutional level it includes debates over [[media ownership]] and control, [[commercialization]], accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. [[censorship]]) and [[deregulation]].

=== Ethics of journalism ===
{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|Photographers crowd around a starlet at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]

The ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in
[[journalism schools|schools of journalism]]. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515000000*/http://smi.curtin.edu.au/netstudies/docs/allen/AllenNCW2001.doc|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics covered by journalism ethics include:
* News manipulation. News can manipulate and be manipulated. Governments and corporations may attempt to manipulate news media; governments, for example, by [[censorship]], and corporations by share ownership. The methods of manipulation are subtle and many. Manipulation may be voluntary or involuntary. Those being manipulated may not be aware of this. See: [[news propaganda]].
* [[Truth]]. Truth may conflict with many other values.
** Public interest. Revelation of military secrets and other sensitive government information may be contrary to the [[public interest]], even if it is true. However, [[public interest]] is not a term which is easy to define.
** Privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. [[Privacy]] is also a [[rights|right]], and one which conflicts with [[free speech]]. See: [[paparazzi]].
** Fantasy. Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Journalism may mix fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. See: [[National Enquirer]], [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]].
** Taste. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience's sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth. See [[photojournalism]].
* Conflict with the law. Journalistic ethics may conflict with the law over issues such as the protection of confidential [[news source]]s. There is also the question of the extent to which it is ethically acceptable to break the law in order to obtain news. For example, undercover reporters may be engaging in [[deception]], [[trespass]] and similar [[torts]] and crimes. See [[undercover journalism]], [[investigative journalism]].

=== Online Journalism ===
The Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists  utilizing online resources.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

While some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Core Issues of Media Ethics in Online Journalism ====
Some of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include he issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethics of entertainment media ===
Issues in the ethics of entertainment media include:
* The depiction of violence and sex, and the presence of [[strong language]]. Ethical guidelines and legislation in this area are common and many media (e.g. film, computer games) are subject to ratings systems and supervision by agencies. An extensive guide to international systems of enforcement can be found under [[motion picture rating system]].
* “Fluff or “Celebrity News”: Over the years, print media has been dying out so journalists began to report on what is referred to as “Celebrity News”, or “Fluff.” As more outlets adopt this topic to report on, people become dependent on them. According to Alden Weight, most people know not to completely trust these outlets due to ethical discrepancies, but the issue arises when people who are not as mature or educated find these reports to be completely true.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weight|first=Alden|date=Spring 2011|title=Making A Monkey Look Good: The Case For Consumer Ethics of Entertainment Media|url=|journal=Teaching Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV check inline}}
* [[Product placement]]. An increasingly common [[marketing]] tactic is the placement of products in entertainment media. The producers of such media may be paid high sums to display branded products. The practice is controversial and largely unregulated. Detailed article: [[product placement]].
* Advertising: Attraction and persuasion are currently found in modern journalism. It is found that these methods of advertising may alter an audience’s point of view of what is realistic and falsified information.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypes]]. Both advertising and entertainment media make heavy use of [[stereotypes]]. Stereotypes may negatively affect people's perceptions of themselves or promote socially undesirable behavior. The stereotypical portrayals of [[men]], [[affluence]] and [[ethnic groups]] are examples of major areas of debate
***Women in Media: Entertainment media often exploits female bodies by objectifying and de-humanizing them. By doing so, the concept of female bodies being bought and sold becomes common.
***Media outlets usually use either images or imagery of female bodies to counter negative news that is provided throughout the day.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* Taste and [[taboos]]. Entertainment media often questions of our [[values]] for artistic and entertainment purposes. [[Normative ethics]] is often about moral values, and what kinds should be enforced and protected. In media ethics, these two sides come into conflict. In the name of art, media may deliberately attempt to break with existing norms and shock the audience. That poses ethical problems when the norms abandoned are closely associated with certain relevant moral values or obligations.  The extent to which this is acceptable is always a hotbed of ethical controversy. See: [[Turner Prize]], [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], [[aesthetics]].

=== Media and democracy ===
In democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be [[constitution]]ally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.
Modern democratic government subsists in [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be [[accountability|accountable]], and for the process of government to be [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], effective communication paths must exist to their [[Electoral district|constituents]]. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if [[press freedom]] disappeared, so would most political [[accountability]].
In this area, media ethics merges with issues of [[civil rights]] and [[politics]]. Issues include: 
* Subversion of [[media independence]] by financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/media-and-democracy Media and Democracy], [[The Nation]] (Editorial), December 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government monitoring of media for intelligence gathering against its own people. See, for example, [[NSA call database]].
See: [[freedom of information]], [[media transparency]] [[Right to Information]].

=== Media integrity ===
Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the [[public interest]] and [[democratic process]], making it resilient to institutional [[corruption]] within the media system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.lessig.org/Institutional_Corruption|title = Institutional Corruption|last = Lessig|first = Lawrence|website = wiki.lessig.org|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: 
* [[Editorial independence|independence]] from private or political interests
* [[Media transparency|transparency]] about own financial interests
* commitment to [[journalism ethics and standards]]
* responsiveness to citizens

The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of [[Southeast Europe|South East Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_FINAL.pdf|title = Media Integrity Matters: Reclaiming Public Service Values in Media and Journalism: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia|last =|first =|publisher = Peace Institute|year = 2014|isbn =|editor-last = Petković|editor-first = Brankica|location = Ljubljana|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the project [http://mediaobservatory.net/about South East European Media Observatory], gathering organisations which are part of the [http://seenpm.org/about-us/ South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM)].

== Attempts to Develop a Universal Code of Media Ethics ==
Within the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capurro; Britz|first=Rafael; Johannes B.|date=2010|title=In Search of a Code of Global Information Ethics: The Road Travelled and New Horizons|url=http://www.communicationethics.net/journal/v7n2-3/v7n2-3_feat2.pdf|journal=Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== UNESCO INFOethics Congresses ===
The ethical facet of the global information society has been on the [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Symposium on Information Ethics, Karlsuhe, 2004 ===
In 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the firs international symposium on information ethics in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsuhe, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, [[information science]], [[media studies]], and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Contexts of media ethics ==

=== Media ethics and the laws ===

=== Media ethics and media economics ===
Media economics where things such as -- [[deregulation]] of media, [[concentration of media ownership]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the U.S, media [[trade unions]] and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, [[Citizen journalism|citizen media]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|low power FM]], [[community radio]]) -- have ethical implications......

=== Media ethics and public officials ===
The [[mass media|media]] has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. [[Truth]] telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of [[truth]] telling is considered [[deception]]. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.

=== Intercultural dimensions of media ethics ===
If values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:
* [[Google China|Google's self-censorship in China]].
* The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and subsequently worldwide.

== Meta-issues in media ethics ==
One theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of [[applied ethics]], differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are [[medical ethics]] and [[business ethics]]. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?

===Similarities between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===

[[Privacy]] and [[honesty]] are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is
the principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been
covered extensively in [[business ethics]] (as well as medical and [[environmental ethics]]).

===Differences between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===
The issues of [[freedom of speech]] and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.

A theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of ''observer'' and ''observed''. The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of [[legal ethics]].

A further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisements and [[Turner prize]] candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own
questioner.

Another characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4122">'''Name-dropping''' is the practice of naming or alluding to important people and institutions within a [[conversation]],&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{citation|title=It's Hard to Eradicate the Name-Dropping Pest|first=Leonard|last=Wibberley|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[narrative|story]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bibliographic name-dropping|first=Harry C.|last=Bauer|journal=Library Review|volume=17|issue=6|year=1960|pages=408–410|doi=10.1108/eb012326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[song]], [[online identity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Public displays of connection|first1=J.|last1=Donath|first2=D.|last2=Boyd|journal=BT Technology Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2004|pages=71–82|doi=10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047585.06264.cc}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or other communication.  The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of [[professional ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Yeah, I work with Beckham’: Issues of confidentiality, privacy and privilege in sport  psychology service delivery|first=Mark B.|last=Anderson|pages=3–13|journal=Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology Review|volume=1|issue=2|year=2005|url=https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005164006/https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-05|deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as part of a logical [[argument]] it can be an example of the [[false authority]] [[fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Understanding arguments|first1=Donald|last1=Evans|first2=Humphrey|last2=Palmer|publisher=Drake Educational Associates|year=1986|page=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'shout-out' can be regarded as a type of name-dropping where someone's name, or a list of names, is spoken out in order to direct attention towards these groups or individuals, often as a means of expressing [[wikt:kudos|kudos]] or making a referral.

==Purposes==
Name-dropping is used to position oneself within a [[social hierarchy]].  It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own [[social status]] to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself or herself above, or into, present company.

Name-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond.  By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known his or her [[social circle]], providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Name-Dropping|title=5 steps to professional presence: how to project confidence, competence, and credibility at work|first1=Susan|last1=Bixler|first2=Lisa Scherrer|last2=Dugan|publisher=Adams Media|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58062-442-8|pages=154–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of [[appeal to authority]], name-dropping can be an important form of informal [[argument]]ation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented.

==Methods==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Use of the first name may be effective, as in the case of "Kingsley" for [[Kingsley Amis]].&lt;ref name="Knack"&gt;Joseph Epstein, "A Nice Little Knack for Name Dropping" in ''Narcissus Leaves the Pool'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Name-dropping is also sometimes used in works of fiction to place a story in a certain historical timeframe, or to imply the involvement of a historical figure in the action (for example, in a story set during World War II, mentioning [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Winston Churchill]]). {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13113">'''New Criticism''' was a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]] that dominated [[American literature|American]] [[literary criticism]] in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized [[close reading]], particularly of [[poetry]], to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from [[John Crowe Ransom]]'s 1941 book ''The New Criticism''.

The work of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholar [[I. A. Richards]], especially his  ''Practical Criticism'' and ''The Meaning of Meaning'', which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Steven. ''Texts and Contexts: Writing about Literature with Critical Theory''. Addison-Wesley, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Also very influential were the [[T. S. Eliot#Literary Criticism|critical essays]] of [[T. S. Eliot]], such as "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]" and "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]", in which Eliot developed his notion of the "[[objective correlative]]". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called [[metaphysical poets]] and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.

==Formalism theory==
New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the "beauties" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on "the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism". Literature was approached  and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrow, Heather. "Twentieth Century Shakespeare Criticism." ''The Riverside Shakespeare''. Houghton Mifflin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's "Criticism, Inc." and [[Allen Tate]]'s "Miss Emily and the Bibliographers".

Close reading (or ''explication de texte'') was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns, and the study of modern poets was the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and [[structuralism]] in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, [[post-structuralism]], and [[Deconstruction|deconstructionist theory]], the [[New Historicism]], and Receptions studies followed.

Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of [[John Crowe Ransom]] of [[Vanderbilt University]], whose students (all Southerners), [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]] would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], New Criticism is a reemergence of the [[Southern Agrarians]].&lt;ref name="versionsofnashville"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title="Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=195 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, "The New Criticism", Cleanth Brooks notes that "The New Critic, like the [[Snark (Lewis Carroll)|Snark]], is a very elusive beast", meaning that there was no clearly defined "New Critical" manifesto, school, or stance.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87: 4 (1979): 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]", which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's ''Understanding Poetry'' and ''Understanding Fiction'' both became staples during this era.

Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as [[rhyme]], meter, [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[characterization]], and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] were used to identify the [[theme (literature)|theme]] of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for [[paradox]], [[ambiguity]], [[irony]], and [[Suspense|tension]] to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.

Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like [[close reading]]) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, and [[reader-response theory]].

==Criticism==
It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were  “uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.” &lt;ref name="Wellek"&gt;Wellek, René. “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra.” ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Summer, 1978), pp. 611–624. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342947].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jancovich"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jancovich | first = Mark | title = The Cultural Politics of the New Criticism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-41652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicative of the [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response school of theory]], Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that “the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification," an assumption which he identifies as the "ideology of liberal humanism,” which is attributed to the New Critics who are “accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt; For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt;

In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay "The New Criticism" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, "If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. . .Reader response is certainly worth studying." However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, "to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste." &lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87:4 (1979) 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least “bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.”&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt; [[René Wellek]], however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the "objectivity" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay "Criticism, Inc." did advocate that "criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic").&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. "Criticism, Inc." ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', Autumn 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra” (1978).

'''"New York Mining Disaster 1941"''' is the debut American single by the British pop group the [[Bee Gees]], released on 14 April 1967. It was written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]," it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in both the UK and the US. It was produced by [[Ossie Byrne]] with their manager [[Robert Stigwood]] as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, ''[[Bee Gees' 1st]].'' This was the first single with Australian drummer [[Colin Petersen]] as an official member of the band.

==Background and writing==
On 3 January 1967, the Gibb brothers, with their parents and Byrne, set sail from Australia to England on the ship [[Fairsky]], reaching Southampton on 6 February. The brothers performed on board in exchange for passage. Later, the Gibb brothers auditioned for Stigwood; they passed, and they signed to [[RSO Records|Robert Stigwood Organisation]] on 24 February. "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was their first song that was written in 1967.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

The first recording session of the Bee Gees after returning to England was a second version of "[[Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1]]," a song recorded by [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]], but was first recorded by Jon Blanchfield in Australia. Kramer's version was recorded on 4 March 1967 in [[IBC Studios]], London, with the Gibb brothers on background vocals.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

Barry and Robin Gibb wrote the song while sitting on a darkened staircase at [[Polydor Records]] following a power cut. The echo of the passing lift inspired them to imagine that they were trapped in a mine.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7494 |title=New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Songfacts) |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song recounts the story of a miner trapped in a cave-in. He is sharing a photo of his wife with a colleague ("Mr. Jones") while they hopelessly wait to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/new-york-mining-disaster-1941-mt0030257568 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 |last=Elias |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the liner notes for their box-set ''[[Tales from the Brothers Gibb]]'' (1990), this song was inspired by the 1966 [[Aberfan disaster|Aberfan mining disaster]] in [[Wales]]. According to Robin, there actually had also been a mining disaster in New York in 1939, but not in 1941.&lt;ref name="also"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-4.html |title=History Part 4 - The story about the Bee Gees |last=Adriaensen |first=Marion |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second and third verses, the lyrical lines get slower and slower, as if to indicate that life is about to end for the miners. On the second chorus, the drums get louder. On the second verse, when Robin sings the line "I keep straining my ears to hear a sound," a violin was featured in response on Robin's line.

==Recording and composition==
[[File:NYMiningdisaster68sheet.png|thumb|left|1967 sheet music cover, Abigail Music, Ltd., London. "Recorded by the Bee Gees on Polydor".]]
On 7 March, the Bee Gees recorded "New York Mining Disaster 1941" in six takes, along with three other songs: "[[I Can't See Nobody]]," "Red Chair, Fade Away," and "Turn of the Century." The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March.&lt;ref name="own"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/67.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1967 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was done first, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo.&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

The song begins in the chord of A minor; as Maurice explained: "There's a lot of weird sounds on this song like the Jew's harp, the string quartet, and of course the special way that Barry plays that guitar chord. Because of his tuning when he plays the minor at the beginning of the song which is different from a conventional A minor, it's a nice mixture when I play my conventional tuning together with Barry's tuning because his [[Open D tuning|open D]] and mine are different." Barry said, "It's Hawaiian tuning, there they play the same way I do. I got a guitar for my ninth birthday and the guy who lived across the road from us just came back from Hawaii and he was the one who taught me that tuning, that's how it started and I never changed."&lt;ref name="also"/&gt;

Robin Gibb took both leading and backing vocals, singing the high harmony while Barry sang the low harmony on the first and second verse:

[[Maurice Gibb]] recalled in a June 2001 interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine: "The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend. People went crazy trying to figure out why they couldn't copy it."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

Robin Gibb recalled to ''The Mail on Sunday'' on November 1, 2009: "We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound."&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
At the time, rumours circulated that the Bee Gees were [[The Beatles]] recording under a pseudonym (the Bee Gees' name was alleged to be code for "Beatles Group"), in part because the record referenced NEMS Enterprises ([[Brian Epstein]]'s management agency, which had just been joined by Bee Gees' manager [[Robert Stigwood]]). The song is unusual in that the lyrics do not contain the song's title, though the originally planned title, "Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones," does appear in the chorus.&lt;ref name=pc49&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 - The British are Coming!

[[Atco Records|Atco]] distributed promos with a blank label and the suggestion that it was an English group whose name started with B. Many [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s thought it was a new Beatles song and played the song heavily. Atco also retitled the song "New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones?)" to make sure people could find it in the shops.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |title=The Bee Gees on British Invasion Bands |publisher=British Invasion |accessdate=14 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175804/http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/the-bee-gees/?doing_wp_cron=1363251960.7064080238342285156250 |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles|Beatles]] lead guitarist [[George Harrison]] met Maurice Gibb at a party several years later, and told him that he had bought a copy of "New York Mining Disaster 1941" because he thought it sounded so much like The Beatles. Maurice's response to Harrison was that the resemblance "was unintentional" and Harrison said, "I knew that, I admire your work."&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&amp;pg=PT258&amp;dq=new+york+mining+disaster+1941+they+can+tell+the+beatles&amp;hl=fil&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nuvTULrrGaeiigeQrYCAAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ |title=The Bee Gees - Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |last=Hughes |first=Andrew |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Gibb explained about this song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robin Gibb explained about this track:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all the DJs on radio stations in the US picked it up immediately thinking it was the Beatles, and it was a hit on that basis. It established us in those early years. It helped our following record which was nothing like the Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The success of this song owes a lot more to the perseverance of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. "We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, but at the end of the day, he was a forceful character. All of these guys were... [[Chas Chandler]] (manager of [[Jimi Hendrix]]) was the same, [[Kit Lambert]] (manager of [[The Who]]) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that," conceded [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]'s [[Alan Bates]]. When the ''Disc &amp; Music Echo'' reported "widespread rumours" that this song had been written by [[Lennon-McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], Robin countered with, "Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles."

Bassist Maurice Gibb, though, had previously said that "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was in fact influenced by the Beatles:&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"New York Mining Disaster 1941" was a total rip-off of The Beatles, we were so influenced by them. In fact it started a mystery [in the USA] about us, because they started playing [it] and saying, 'They're this new group from England that begins with a B and finished with an s' so they all said, 'Ah, it's The Beatles, not naming it, they're doing that trick again.' The disc jockey would play it and play it and play it and, 'Guess who it is?' and people would guess, and they wouldn't get the answer. I heard [the idea] came actually from [[Ahmet Ertegun]] and [[Jerry Wexler]]. To us it was an honour, to actually think we were as good as The Beatles."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music video and live performances==
On the video, the band only features four members (but [[Vince Melouney]] later joined the band), Barry playing his guitar, Maurice playing his [[Rickenbacker 4001]], Robin Gibb on vocals and drummer [[Colin Petersen]] wears a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-Qq7ucMA0 |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 (1967) |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group found time to record their first BBC session at Playhouse Theatre, Northumberland Avenue, London, with producer Bill Bebb, on which they performed this song, with the songs "In My Own Time," "One Minute Woman," and "Cucumber Castle." When the BBC Light Programme's ''Saturday Club'' presented by Brian Matthew was broadcast on April 22, it was noted that there were "rave reviews from the audition panel."&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On the song's promotional clip, the band only feature four members (the three Gibb brothers and drummer [[Colin Petersen]]) The group (Barry, Robin, Maurice, Colin and Vince) made their first British TV appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' performing this song on May 11 and were rather awe-struck at the company they were keeping.&lt;ref name="work"/&gt; On 20 May 1967, the group performed this song on ''[[Beat-Club]],'' a German TV program.

The Bee Gees performed this song on 21 July 1967 at the Stockholm Palladium, Stockholm, Sweden., 12 August 1967 at The Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England and Christ the King College at Newport, England on 27 September 1967. Since 1967, the song has been part of every Bee Gees concert, eventually becoming part of their acoustic medley performed during the middle of the concert. It was also performed on the show ''[[Beat-Club]]'' in [[Germany]], on that performance Robin wears a hat and plays [[violin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlSLDUGKWEc |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster 1941 Live in Beat Club |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by the group in 1973 on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' with Barry and Maurice on rhythm guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ5tSc3tqOE |title=Bee Gees - New York Mining Disaster - live, 1973 |publisher=You Tube |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The 1969 [[David Bowie]] song "[[Space Oddity]]" owes a debt to the style, arrangement and lyrics of "New York Mining Disaster 1941." Like "New York Mining Disaster 1941," "Space Oddity" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person. "'Space Oddity' was a Bee Gees type song," Bowie’s colleague John "Hutch" Hutchinson has said. "David knew it, and he said so at the time, the way he sang it, it’s a Bee Gees thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidbowie.com/users/lunamagic/space1.html |title=David Bowie - Space Oddity |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Marc Bolan]] explained: "I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees, who were very big then."

[[Paul McCartney]] said: "It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them, they're great!' And they went on to be even greater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |title=Bee Gees |publisher=14.brinkster.com |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235737/http://www14.brinkster.com/corteza/bg/citas.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Novelist [[Haruki Murakami]] made "New York Mining Disaster" the title of one of his short stories. The piece was included in his collection "[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umrigar |first=Thrity |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/10/01/murakami_pulls_mind_bending_stories_from_the_ruins_of_broken_rules/ |title=Murakami pulls mind-bending stories from the ruins of broken rules - The Boston Globe |website=Boston.com |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It recognizes that [[economic growth]] does not inherently contribute to human development&lt;ref name=MOFA&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan's ODA Annual Report (Summary)|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/oda/summary/1996/contents.html|author=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrategicOrg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korten|first=David C.|title=Strategic Organization for People-Centered Development|journal=Public Administration Review|date=July–August 1984|volume=44 | issue = 4|pages=341–352|publisher=Business Source Complete. EBSCO|doi=10.2307/976080}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calls for changes in social, political, and environmental values and practices.

== History ==
In 1984, [[David Korten]], a former regional advisor to the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID), proposed a people-centered development strategy that incorporated the values of justice, sustainability, and inclusiveness. According to Korten, the prevailing growth-focused development strategy is unsustainable and inequitable. He calls for transformations of our institutions, technology, values, and behavior, "consistent with our ecological and social realities."&lt;ref name=Getting4&gt;{{cite book|last=Korten|first=David C.|title=Getting to the 21st Century|year=1990|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=W Hartford, CT|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 1989, The Manila Declaration on People's Participation and Sustainable Development sets forth principles and guidelines for enacting these transformations.&lt;ref name=Manila&gt;{{cite news|title=The Manila Declaration on People's Participation and Sustainable Development|author=Asian NGO Coalition|author2=Environmental Liaison Center International|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of people-centered development gained recognition at several international development conferences in the 1990s, such as the Earth Summit in 1992, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, and the Summit for Social Development of 1995.&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt; The concept was first widely promoted in the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s (UNDP) Human Development Report in 1990, in which countries' level of development was measured by the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI). The UNDP's report deems economic growth a necessary means to achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt;

Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in its 1996 [[official development assistance]] (ODA) report that the objective of people-centered development is, "helping humankind lead an affluent and happy life."&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt; "Shaping the 21st Century," a report published by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1996, made people-centered development a target policy for all member countries. It stressed the importance of local ownership, participation, and [[capacity building]] while attaining economic growth.&lt;ref name=Shaping&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Co-operation|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/35/2508761.pdf|author=OECD Development Assistance Committee|agency=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central themes ==

=== Sustainability ===
[[Sustainability]] is an inherent component and explicit goal of people-centered development. People-centered development calls for the establishment of self-supporting social and economic systems, key elements of a sustainable society.&lt;ref name=Shaping /&gt; In addition to its commitment to people-centered development, the DAC High-Level Meeting in May 1996 made sustainability a concrete development goal, requiring the implementation of national sustainability initiatives by 2005 in order to reverse deforestation, water pollution, and other trends of environmental degradation.&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt;

The Manila Declaration stated that people-centered development is the only way to achieve sustainable communities. Expanding beyond the environmental scope of sustainability, it advocates small-scale community actions in order to enhance economic self-reliance and create reliable sources of income. It also calls for debt reductions and blames excessive long-term foreign debt financing for the cyclical repayment burdens and policy impositions that inhibit sustainable development.&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt;

David Korten claims that people-centered development is the only way to develop sustainable communities.&lt;ref name=Getting&gt;{{cite book|last=Korten|first=David C.|title=Getting to the 21st Century|year=1990|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=W Hartford, CT|pages=3–4, 67–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the common development practice of increased economic output through natural resource depletion.&lt;ref name=Getting /&gt; Korten also advocates sustainability in the financing of development projects and the relationships of external assistance. He calls on external development partners to support objectives chosen by the people, building communities' capacity to manage resources and meet local needs independently.&lt;ref name=StrategicOrg /&gt;

=== Participation ===
In the context of people-centered development, central elements of participation include:
*[[Democratic process]]es&lt;ref name=Shaping /&gt;
*Government accountability&lt;ref name=Getting /&gt;
*Access to relevant information&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt;
*Gender equality&lt;ref name=Equality&gt;{{cite news|title=DAC Guidelines for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Co-operation|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/56/46/28313843.pdf|author=OECD Development Assistance Committee|agency=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD noted that democratic processes are essential to people-centered development because they allow communities to create their own development goals and influence the decisions that determine their [[quality of life]]. Community participation and true democratic process demand that people have the means to hold government officials and public institutions accountable.&lt;ref name=Equality /&gt; It requires that governments act as enablers for the peoples' agenda, creating policies that enhance citizen action.&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt;

Communities must have access to relevant, reliable information in order to make the best decisions for themselves and their communities.&lt;ref name=Equality /&gt; The Manila Declaration proposed global monitoring systems to increase peoples' access to relevant information in order for communities to make rational decisions and protect their interests.&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt;

True democratic processes can only be achieved when men and women are represented equally.&lt;ref name=Equality /&gt; People-centered development necessitates equality in the roles of men and women, a systemic problem in many developing nations.&lt;ref name=Shaping /&gt; The OECD noted several reasons why women are essential to sustainable, people-centered development:&lt;ref name=Equality /&gt;

=== Justice ===
In the context of people-centered development, elements of justice include:
*Local ownership&lt;ref name=Shaping /&gt;
*Sovereignty of the people &amp; government enablement&lt;ref name=Getting /&gt;
*Employment and income generation&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt;

The OECD's DAC affirms that the role of external development partners is to enhance developing countries' capacity to meet sustainable development requirements.&lt;ref name=Equality /&gt; This strategy emphasizes the need for local ownership so that communities have responsibility and control over their resources in order to benefit themselves and also stresses the role of government as an enabler for the peoples' agenda.&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt; According to David Korten, individuals have a greater incentive to pursue sustainable environmental practices when resources are locally owned.&lt;ref name=Getting /&gt; In addition, he says that people-centered development "rejects the right of one person to self-enrichment based on the appropriation of the resources on which another person's survival depends."&lt;ref name=Getting4 /&gt;

Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs adopted a strategy of people-centered development in 1996, citing the concept's growing centrality at international development conferences. It recognized a primary concern of people-centered development – whether or not the benefits of economic growth (e.g. increased employment and income) are seen in underserved communities.&lt;ref name=MOFA /&gt; The Manila Declaration proposed reductions in resource exports in order to address this concern. A reduction in exports would allow communities to meet their local needs first.&lt;ref name=Manila /&gt; According to Korten, a share of surplus production should then be used to create high value-added products, providing the optimal benefits to developing communities.&lt;ref name=Getting /&gt;

{{Politics}}
'''Politics''' (from {{lang-gr|πολιτικά|''Politiká''}}, meaning "affairs of the cities") is the process of [[Decision-making|making decisions]] that apply to  members of a group.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political|title=Political &amp;#124; Definition of Political by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than all [[Political science]], is sometimes referred to as [[Politology]] (not to be confused with [[Politicology]]).

In modern nation-states, people have formed political parties to represent their ideas. They agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Sartori|title=Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0954796617|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[election]] is usually a competition between different parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfxMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=1 April 2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0955820328|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in [[Germany]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]].

Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as "the art or science of government" and "political principles"), but often does carry a connotation of dishonest malpractice.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1137317865|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0765627315|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used negatively for many years: the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]] as published in 1745 calls on God to "Confound their politics",&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Gstk.png|God save our lord the king]], ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' 15 October 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "play politics", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: "We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iKyaxXvPYcQC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=We+do+not+play+politics;+anti-slavery+is+no+half-jest+with+us#v=onepage&amp;q=We%20do%20not%20play%20politics%3B%20anti-slavery%20is%20no%20half-jest%20with%20us&amp;f=false|title=American Orations: V.

A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, [[negotiation]] with other political subjects, making [[law]]s, and exercising [[force (law)|force]], including [[warfare]] against adversaries.&lt;ref name="Hammarlund1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bo Hammarlund|title=Politik utan partier: studier i Sveriges politiska liv 1726-1727|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnRlAAAAIAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda P.

It is very often said that politics is about power.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Joe|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Alex|title=Political Geography|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculyork/reader.action?docID=10870263}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[political system]] is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. The [[history of political thought]] can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the works of [[Confucius]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Women voter outreach 1935 English Yiddish.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Women voter outreach from 1935.]]
The word comes from the same [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word from which the title of [[Aristotle]]'s book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (Πολιτικά, ''Polis'') also derives; ''polis'' means "affairs of the cities". The book title was rendered in [[Early Modern English]] in the mid-15th century as "Polettiques"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Diets and Sayings of the Philosophers'' (Early English Text Society, Original Series [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7G0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= No. 211], 1941; reprinted 1961), p. 154: "the book of Etiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and of Polettiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt; it became "politics" in [[Modern English]]. The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus|title=A Latin Dictionary|author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state",&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203856/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), "citizen"&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), "city".&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt;

===Classifications===
Formal politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

Semi-formal politics is politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where [[Students' union|student government political party]] politics is often important.

Informal politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that "politics is everywhere".&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

==History of state politics==
The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and [[economics]] of the institutions of [[government]].

===The state===
{{main article|State (polity)}}

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the ''[[Ancient warfare|art of warfare]]''. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21 August 1970|volume=169|issue=3947|doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733|pmid=17820299|pages=733–738|bibcode=1970Sci...169..733C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the American  Revolution put an end to the "[[divine right of kings]]".  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of [[hereditary monarchy]].

The king often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|council]] without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://history-world.org/absolutism.htm|work=International World History Project|title=European Absolutism And Power Politics|date=1998|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html|title=Constitutional Monarchy|publisher=British Monarchist League Ltd|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earl]]s and [[duke]]s in England and Scotland, the dukes and [[count]]s in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|pages=73–96|quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:2017.07.26 Protest Trans Military Ban, White House, Washington DC USA 7646 (36056769341).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Activism is a form of politics.]]
===Forms of political organization===
There are many forms of [[political organization]], including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.

According to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.

All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]]. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]] has a more dispersed system of [[judicial power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation|title=Confederation vs Federation – Difference and Comparison|publisher=Diffen|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Civil War]], the argument by the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union didn't stand because of the Federal government's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5EUNr295pgcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=In+the+American+Civil+War,+the+contention+of+the+Confederate+States+that+a+State+could+secede+from+the+Union+was+untenable+because+of+the+power+enjoyed+by+the+Federal+government+in+the+executive,+legislative+and+judiciary+branches#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20American%20Civil%20War,%20the%20contention%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20that%20a%20State%20could%20secede%20from%20the%20Union%20was%20untenable%20because%20of%20the%20power%20enjoyed%20by%20the%20Federal%20government%20in%20the%20executive,%20legislative%20and%20judiciary%20branches&amp;f=false|title=Social Sciences|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q=|pages=1–164|year=1900|publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Co.|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global politics===
{{main article|Global politics}}
'''Global politics''' include different '''practices''' of political [[globalization]] in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and relative fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the [[hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international '''organizations'''. The [[United Nations]] has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabinowitch|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Rabinowitch|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=World+politics+final+nuclear+holocaust&amp;q=World%20politics%20final%20nuclear%20holocaust|date=June 1973|page=13|issn=0096-3402|quote=...the rationale of traditional patterns of world politics.|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is radically undesirable for man, "[[nuclear blackmail]]" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Dulles|title=The Craft of Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mH3qdHK6_EsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=the+craft+of+intelligence+April+1963#v=onepage&amp;q=|page=224|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1599215778|quote=...using 'nuclear blackmail' as a threat to intimidate other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] from the implementation of U.S. vs [[Soviet Union]] nuclear blackmail policy.

According to [[political science]] professor [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], global politics is affected by ''values'': norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each:
{{quote|Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2014|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul James (academic)|title=Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global|url=https://www.academia.edu/7547819|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|pages=x|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political corruption===
{{main article|Political corruption}}
[[William Pitt the Elder]], speaking before the British [[House of Lords]], 9 January 1770, observed: "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|editor-first=William|editor-last=Safire|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed more famously by [[John Dalberg-Acton]] over a century later: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;Dalberg-Acton, John (Lord Acton). [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887]. Published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Corruption Law &amp; Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/political-corruption|website=USLegal|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title= African corruption 'on the wane'|publisher=BBC News – Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Political parties===
{{main article|Political party}}

A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Politics as an academic discipline===
[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely|page=566|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0195343342|quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0538497190|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, as well as examining the preconditions for the formation of political communities;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community|first1=Timothy|last1= Laurie|first2=Hannah|last2= Stark|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|volume=22|issue=4|pages=69–79|year= 2017|url=https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two; and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blattberg|first=Charles|title=Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies|journal=Public Affairs Quarterly|date=July 2001|volume=15|issue=3|pages=193–217|ssrn=1755117|accessdate=|issn=0887-0373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farr|first1=James|last2=Seidelman|first2=Raymond|title=Discipline and history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&amp;q=|year=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0472065127|quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political values==
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the [[Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map of the World]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]
{{main article|Political spectrum}}

Several different [[political spectrum|political spectra]] have been proposed.

===Left–right===
Political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY3b0mcDF9QC|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0140447576|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification|inequality]] while the left wing often values [[Social progress|progress]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]], [[libertarianism]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C|author=Daniel J. Levinson|title=Conservatism and Radicalism|publisher=''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality – believing it to be unethical or unnatural&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction'' (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0226062465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#"National Action" politics|National Action Party]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miis.edu/media/view/18971/original/balenouvelleresarticle.pdf|title=bale|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Authoritarian–libertarian===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|authorlink=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/150-years-of-libertarian|title=150 years of Libertarian|author=afaq|website=Anarchists Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of society. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/totalitarian?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4213">The [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] '''Preparing to Teach in the Lifelong Learning Sector''' (PTLLS) qualification,&lt;ref name="C&amp;GPT092014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/learning/teaching/6302-preparing-to-teach-in-the-lifelong-learning-sector-ptlls#tab=information |title=Preparing to Teach in the Lifelong Learning Sector (PTLLS) (6302) |date=5 Sep 2014 |author=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to colloquially as "PETALS",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptacademies.co.uk/ptlls-training-course-in-leeds/|website=Concept Academies|title=PETALS Training Courses in Leeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an initial [[teacher training]] qualification, studied at [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 3 or 4, for those new to teaching, or wanting to start out as associate teachers, or currently teaching in the [[United Kingdom]] and requiring certification or qualification, or to become full teachers in [[Further Education]] (FE) or in the [[Lifelong Learning]] sector of education.

The PTLLS is currently the lowest of the teaching qualifications specifically for this sector of education, with others being the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 3/4 [[Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (CTLLS)&lt;ref name="C&amp;GCT292014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/learning/teaching/6304-teaching-in-the-lifelong-learning-sector-ctlls#tab=information |title=Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (CTLLS) (6304) |date=29 Aug 2014 |author=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 5 [[Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (DTLLS)&lt;ref name="C&amp;GDT292014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/learning/teaching/6305-teaching-in-the-lifelong-learning-sector-dtlls#tab=information |title=Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) (6305) |date=29 Aug 2014 |author=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualifications. Following successful completion of the PTLLS and upon achieving the qualification, an associate teacher would then have to take the more advanced CTLLS for the Certificate and after that the DTLLS for the Diploma.

To achieve the certification, the learner/associate teacher/trainer does not have to be in a teaching role in order to be assessed, making it a very achievable certification and a suitable starting point for anyone wanting to become an educator. Assessment is in the form of a 'micro-teach' session and submission of assignments and portfolio of evidence. The Level 4 CTLLS, however, requires one to be in a teaching or training role in order to be assessed 'on-the-job', as well as through the submission of assignments and a portfolio of evidence.

The PTLLS is the first stage of a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] (Post Graduate Certificate in Education) in [[Lifelong learning]] and is currently required prior to achieving the CTLLS and DTLLS to gain [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS) status. It is a requirement that all teachers obtain the PTLLS award, or the equivalent, to be able to continue to teach in the [[further education]] sector in the UK.

The PTLLS is in the process of being phased out along with the CTLLS and the DTLLS, and will eventually be replaced with the [[Award in Education and Training]] qualification at QCF Level 3, 4 and 5, respectively.&lt;ref name="C&amp;GITTMay2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talent.ac.uk/uploads/news/2978_City&amp;Guilds_Need_to_know_May_v1.pdf |title=For the attention of the Initial Teacher Training PTLLS/CTLLS/DTLLS tutors, teachers and coordinators |date=May 2013 |author=City &amp; Guilds |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908041411/http://www.talent.ac.uk/uploads/news/2978_City%26Guilds_Need_to_know_May_v1.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dreams]] have been interpreted in many different ways from being a source of power to the capability of understanding and communicating with the dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|title=Religiosity and dream recall|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201310/religiosity-and-dream-recall|publisher=Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|title=Religion and dreams|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201110/religion-and-dreams|publisher=Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=R.|title=A viewpoint|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=37|pages=411–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional forms of societies considered dreams as portals to another world, a spirit world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  These societies would even say they could gain most of their religious ideas from dreams.  They could identify the sacred and gain access to sacred realms or portals to the supernatural.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Psychologists have been researching dreams as of the 21st century because the connection between religious connotations in dreams has brought about growth and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  However, many different psychologists claim there is very little evidence to the research on the [[psychology of religion]] and dreams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Dream interpretation==

The contemporary 21st century has brought about a scientific [[materialism]] that can be detrimental to understanding the concept of dreams and how to interpret them.  Traditionally, the concept of dreaming and interpreting dreams through religious means is universal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Some of the cultures around the world consider [[dream interpretation]] through their religious views as a means of spiritual discipline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  A psychological view of this connection between religious views and dream interpretation stems from analyzing the content of dreams.  The [[continuity theory]] has proposed that dream and waking cognition have everything in common except that dream cognition does not have the capability of being reflective.  The counter argument to this theory would purpose that dream and waking cognition are completely different.  Researchers such as [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have claimed that dream processing must include a more symbolic approach, utilizing metaphors to explain its purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|last2=Andresen|first2=J.|last3=Arrowhead|first3=J.|last4=Messer|first4=G.|title=Counterfactual cognitive operations in dreams|journal=Dreaming|pages=121–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of dream interpretation===

Many different researchers have tried to understand the purpose behind dreaming and state their most apprehensive work behind understanding early childhood dreams.  [[Sigmund Freud]] (1900/1965) claimed that dreams from childhood were illustrations of wish-fulfillment dreams that begin in naivety during childhood and escalate into later adulthood.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[Carl Jung]] (1974) believed that childhood dreams were a sign of transpersonal wisdom from the unconscious.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[G. William Domhoff]] (1996) and [[S. H. Foulkes]] (1999) were both known for arguing childhood dreams as a reflection of the immature development involved in the consciousness of a young child, involving characteristics such as being passive and bland.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[Antti Revonsuo]] (2000) was in support of childhood dreams, in particular nightmares, to better support his idea of "threat simulation theory" found in dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiller|first1=J.|last2=Sanchez|first2=A.|last3=Broughton|first3=B.|last4=Bulkeley|first4=K.|title=Earliest remembered dreams|journal=Dreaming|pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldviews==

From the earliest of ones, dreams have been best interpreted as part of a religious worldview.  Traditional societies wouldn't have had a problem declaring dreams to be more than just a psychological state, but of an encounter with a different realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gollnick|first1=J.|title=Dream interpretation in the psychology of religion: A topic review|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/28/3/293.abstract|publisher=Dream interpretation in the psychology of religion: A topic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the world's religious traditions in the 21st century have considered dreams to be sacred and part of a religious landscape.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  Each culture has a different way of expressing their traditions and contemporary beliefs on dream and interpretation.  It is important to explore these different worldviews to gain a better sense of the relation between religion and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplinsky|first1=C.|title=Shifting shadows: Shaping dynamics in the cultural unconscious|journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology|pages=189–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal/indigenous worldview===

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]' belief of dreaming is more similar to [[Buddhism]] versus that of common Western beliefs.  Their view of dreams and dream interpretation looks similar to that of an interactive conversation. The conversation happens between them and the world.  They are able to have this conversation because they don't see a difference between dreaming and waking reality, but rather an overlapping experience.  In this particular event in which they are overlapping worlds, they are able to open up their spiritual eyes to the visible and invisible, the audible and inaudible. The main goal of dreaming within this worldviews is twofold.  They first look to gain a strong connection between them and the world as well as enhance their self-knowledge and respect among their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tedlock|first1=B.|title=The poetics And spirituality Of dreaming: A Native American enactive theory|journal=Dreaming|pages=183–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western worldview===

====Christianity====

The belief of dreams tying with religious themes in the Western worldview was not something that was naturally intuitive.  By having belief in these things, the [[Western culture]] would open their minds to a non-rational and imaginative force that opens up people's mind to understanding realism with evil and how one can have hope over it.  Pursuing dreams does not require God or gods and is why the Western culture receives this practice openly among their religious views and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=R. L.|title=Review of the wilderness of dreams: Exploring the religious meanings of dreams in modern Western culture|journal=Dreaming|pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been debate among researchers as to whether researching dreams is worthwhile.  Some have debated that dreams are purposeless and completely random, whereas other have suggested dreams having an adaptive function that allows for positive implications.  Although there isn't findings of specifically lowering negative effects, research has alluded to dreams embellished with religious themes having a positive benefit for the user.  The biggest finding was related to dreams and religion included exploring this connection as a form of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pargament|first1=K. I.|last2=Phillips|first2=R. E.|title=The sanctification of dreams: Prevalence and implications|journal=Dreaming|pages=141–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect of the Western worldview of dreams and dream interpretation with religious connotations has spread as far as the churches in [[Nigeria]], [[Africa]].  These churches believed their leaders in the church would receive frequent dreams that would guide them and their followers to a special spiritual status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renne|first1=E. P.|title=Dressing in the stuff of dreams: Sacred dress and religious authority in Southwestern Nigeria|journal=Dreaming|pages=120–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern worldview===

====Buddhism====

Amidst different [[Hindu]]ism and Buddhist contexts, there are different theories such as sleepless dreaming that appear.  This is unique to the [[Eastern culture]] because it is rarely mentioned with the Western culture when discussing the possibility of dreams and religion. The only time Western writers talk of dreamless sleep is when referencing Hindu or Buddhist contexts.  This Eastern viewpoint gives a unique insight on how practices in Buddhist circles can be contextualized.   This dreamless sleep as mentioned prior is part of [[Tibetan Buddhist|Tibetan Buddhism]] practice of achieving a particular mental state before going into sleep.  They describe this experience as such of having visions and they require some visual criteria to be present for dreamless sleep to be achieved.  Its highest form of praise is that it gives practical guidelines for the practicing Buddhist and their progress in [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=G.|title=Dreams and dreamless sleep|journal=Dreaming|pages=199–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====

The [[Muslim]] society believes different forms of dreaming can help people come into contact with past martyrs of their [[faith]].  Their purpose is to give the dreamer full understanding of the martyr's existence and implications towards the future. Different examples of how dreams can affect the future of Muslims include but are not limited to: showing a prosperous future, motivate them into moral or spiritual development and warning them of impending dangers.  Decisions made by Muslims can be as important as deciding a future spouse can be determined through one particular dream.   The ultimate purpose behind these dreams is to give the devout Muslim a deeper insight into the truth that is not available in waking reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirriyeh|first1=E.|title=Dream narratives of Muslims' martyrdom: Constant and changing roles past and present|journal=Dreaming|pages=168–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17579">{{Italic title}}{{canon law}}'''''{{lang|la|Regulæ Juris}}''''', also spelled as '''''{{lang|la|Regulae}} -''''' and '''''- {{lang|la|Iuris}}''''' ({{Language with name/for||2=Latin|3=Rules of Law|links=no}}) is a generic term for general rules or principles serving chiefly for the interpretation of canon laws.

==Canonical use==
{{see also|Interpretation (canon law)}}
In a specific sense, however, ''{{lang|la|regulæ juris}}'' are certain fundamental laws in the form of [[axiom]]s found in the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'', eleven inserted by [[Pope Gregory IX]] at the end of the fifth Book of [[Decretals]], eighty-eight by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in the last title of ''Liber Sextus Decretalium''.

These rules are an exposition of several laws on the same subject, conclusions or deductions, rather than principles of law drawn from constitutions or decisions, and consequently reserved to the last title of the two books mentioned, in imitation of [[Justinian]] in the "Digest" (L, l, tit. 17).

While these rules are of great importance, it must be stated that few general statements are without exception. Some of the axioms are applicable in all matters, others are confined to judicial trials, benefices, etc. As examples the following are taken from the Liber Sextus: No one can be held to the impossible (6); Time does not heal what was invalid from the beginning (18); What is not allowed to the defendant, is denied to the plaintiff (32); What one is not permitted to do in his own name, he may not do through another (47).

== The Eighty-Eight by Boniface VIII ==
These 88 legal dicta or maxims known as ''{{lang|la|De Regulis Juris}}'' were promulgated in 1298 by [[Boniface VIII]].

'''Rent control in the United States''' refers to laws or ordinances that set [[price control]]s on the [[renting]] of American residential [[Apartment|housing]]. They function as a [[price ceiling]].{{ r | GPG }}

The loose term "rent control" can apply to several types of price control:
* "strict price ceilings", also known as "'''rent freeze'''" systems, or "'''absolute'''" or "'''first generation'''" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) 
* "vacancy control", also known as "'''strict'''" or "'''strong'''" rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and 
* "vacancy decontrol", also known as "'''tenancy'''" or "'''second-generation'''" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).{{ r | GPG }}

As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==History==
In the [[United States]] during [[World War I]], rents were "controlled" through a combination of public pressure and the efforts of local anti-rent-profiteering committees. Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws.  Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to [[World War II|WWII]]-era shortages, or following [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1971 wage and price controls.  They remain in effect or have been reintroduced in some cities with large [[leasehold estate|tenant]] populations, such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Oakland, California]]. Many smaller communities also have rent control — notably the [[California]] cities of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]&lt;ref name="dca.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/appendix2.shtml|title=Landlord/Tenant Book - California Department of Consumer Affairs|first=Department of Consumer Affairs, State of|last=California|website=www.dca.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; — along with many small towns in [[New Jersey]]. In the early 1990s, rent control in some cities, such as [[Boston]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], was ended by state [[referendum|referenda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |vauthors= |title=Massachusetts Election Statistics 1994: Ballot Question #9 |year= 1994|publisher= [Boston?] : The Division|quote= | url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettsele1994mass#page/522/mode/2up |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===

[[New York State]] has had the longest [[Rent control in New York|history of rent controls]], since 1943. New York City contains the majority of units covered by rent control. Rent control laws have stayed on the books for decades in New York because of an inadequate supply of "decent, affordable housing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenant.net/Oversight/50yrRentReg/history.html|title=History of Rent Regulation|website=www.tenant.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worsening in the rental market led to the enactment of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, which aimed to help increase the number of available rental units. The current system is very complicated, and most of the protected renters are elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metcouncil.net/factsheets/rentcontrol.htm|title=Rent Control Fact Sheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

In California, municipal enactment of rent controls followed the high [[inflation]] of the 1970s (causing rents to continually rise){{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=1 | q=Inflation averaged 8 percent in the Bay Area during the 1970s; renters were forced to pay rents that were changing monthly as the dollar devalued and the demand for hard assets, especially real estate, grew.

Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician [[Howard Jarvis]] tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.{{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=2 | q=Proposition 13 threw fuel on the fire. One of Howard Jarvis&amp;apos; arguments for rolling back and rapidly freezing escalating property taxes (an inflation-induced mess, too) was that the savings would be passed onto tenants. Although several large San Francisco property owners passed Proposition 13 savings on to some 7,000 tenants, most landlords did not. In jurisdictions with large tenant populations like San Francisco, the empty promises became a rallying cry for activists. }}

In 2018, a statewide [[initiative]] (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact "strong" or "vacancy control" systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings newer than 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. (All currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.){{ r | SJMN_RC_failed | p=1 | q=Prop. 10 took aim at a decades-old state law that prohibits cities from enforcing certain types of rent control. Without that law, cities would have had the power to place price caps on rented single family homes, condominiums and apartment buildings constructed after 1995 — or in the case of cities with older rent-control policies, such as Oakland and San Francisco, apartments built after the late 1970s or early 1980s. Under current state law, those units cannot be subject to rent control. ... In addition to expanding the types of properties that would fall under rent control, Prop. 10 would have let cities permanently cap the price of an apartment, allowing only modest increases even after tenants move out. That policy, known as vacancy control, was used decades ago in a handful of cities including Berkeley, East Palo Alto and Santa Monica before California passed the Costa-Hawkins law banning it. Currently, landlords can raise prices to market rates after a tenant in a rent-controlled unit leaves. Vacancy control would have immediately taken effect in Berkeley if Prop. 10 passed, as it has remained on the books, unenforced, for more than two decades. }} The proposition failed, 62% to 38%.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Dillon, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-hold-proposition-10-rent-control-1541029296-htmlstory.html "California voters reject Prop. 10"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 6, 2018.

===Mobile homes===

In some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for [[mobile home]] parks.  Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Statements are very likely true, but need references to back up the numbers. }}  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Statements may be true, but need references to prove the claims, and a reference to prove that the non-building of mobile home parks is BECAUSE OF rent control; otherwise this statement is irrelevant to this article. }}

==Law==
Rent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/rentboard_page.asp?id=54501|title=San Francisco Rent Board: Fact Sheet 1 – General Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York State]] generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/ora/pubs/html/orafac1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the [[Consumer Price Index]] or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.&lt;ref&gt;

Rent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner.(Gilderbloom &amp; Markham,1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.1996.tb00388.x|title=Moderate Rent Control: Sixty Cities over 20 Years|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|volume=18|issue=4|pages=409–430|year=2016|last1=Gilderbloom|first1=John I.|last2=Markham|first2=John P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
Rent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|256|135|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|264|543|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The application was often inconsistent. For example, in [[New York City]], almost half of property units continue to have the protection of rent regulation, while other units on the private market are left to be priced according to what the market will bear.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; {{ cite web | last=Beyer | first=Scott | date=April 24, 2015 | title=How Ironic: America's Rent-Controlled Cities Are Its Least Affordable | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ |accessdate=12 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501001409/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/04/24/how-ironic-americas-rent-controlled-cities-are-its-least-affordable/ | archive-date=2015-05-01 | dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|475|260|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].

===State law===
As of 2018, four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Maryland]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[Mobile home|mobile homes]]).{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | Landlord_com }}

==Arguments for==

===Economic===
The rental-accommodation market suffers from [[asymmetrical information|information asymmetries]] and high [[transaction costs]]. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the [[lease]]. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with [[building code]] requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.{{ r | GPG | p=1 | q=Another justification is to correct market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and high transaction costs. Because of the high cost of moving, tenants can arguably be pressured by landlords to accept rent increases. Tenants may also be unaware of the real condition of units until they move in. If the tenant complains, the landlord may threaten to increase the rent. }} &lt;ref name=R_vU-S &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-0462(01)00093-X |title=A model of regulation in the rental housing market |journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=475–500 |year=2002 |last1=Raess |first1=Pascal |last2=von Ungern-Sternberg |first2=Thomas }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In older buildings, rent control may broaden incentives to renovate individual units: tenants may invest [[sweat equity]] and their own money to improve their homes if they are protected from landlords trying to capture the added value,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kx8-Lz5K1YYC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=%22sweat+equity%22+%22rent+control%22 | title = Community versus Commodity: Tenants and the American City | isbn = 9780791498439 | author1 = Čapek | first1 = Stella M | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMLT_history &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | doi= | title=Background history | last= | first= | publisher=Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants | date=2002-01-01 | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629051939/http://www.lmlt.org/lmlt1.html | archive-date=2012-06-29 | dead-url=yes | pages= | quote=As early as the mid-1960s, artists began pioneering the economically-depressed manufacturing zone of lower Manhattan known as SoHo where they found affordable "raw" or "as is" spaces large enough to both live and work (ie: lofts). Delighted to receive rent for these often abandoned, derelict spaces, commercial property owners welcomed and encouraged the residential occupancy of their buildings. Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense. The City, which was equally delighted by the stabilization of the property tax base, turned a blind eye to the fact that none of these buildings had a residential Certificate of Occupancy. }} &lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=August 2018|reason=The second source does not support the statement; these tenants improved their units even though they had no rent-control; technically they were living there illegally. }} while vacancy decontrol preserves landlords' financial incentive to renovate vacant units because it allows them to re-rent at market value.

===Moral===

Tenants' rights activists argue that rent control is necessary in times of long term housing shortages (See [[California housing shortage]]) to reduce the human suffering caused by increasing rents and the homelessness which results when people who can no longer afford the rent increases get evicted.{{r | SD_RC_Tenant_Union | p=1 | q=... the projections show that even building at maximum capacity, the county will not be able to catch up and there will still be a 152,000-housing-unit shortage in 2050. ... Unless San Diego gets rent control, greedy landlords and government officials will be directly responsible for the rampant creation of homelessness and increased worker suffering. }}

==Arguments against==
Writing in 1946, economists [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George J. Stigler]] said: "Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/library/books/roofs-or-ceilings-the-current-housing-problem/|title=Roofs or Ceilings?

Although those paying lower than market rent are "protected," most economists argue that newer residents actually pay higher rent due to reduced supply.

===Economic===
In a 1992 [[Stratified sampling|stratified]], random survey of 464 US economists, economics [[graduate school|graduate students]], and members of the [[American Economic Association]], 93% "generally agreed" or "agreed with [[wikt:proviso|provisos]]" that "A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available."{{ r | 1992_poll | p=204 | q=76.3% generally agreed, 16.6% agreed but with provisos }} {{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial.

A 2009 review of the economic literature{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=106 | q=If rent-control is such a “no-brainer,” why bother to scrutinize the literature? The cluster of restrictions persists in roughly 140 jurisdictions in the United States as of 2001. As Hazlett (1982) notes, “economists have been notoriously thorough in convincing themselves of the destructive effects of rent control and notoriously inept at convincing anyone else” (278). Better understanding of the issue might help correct the error, prevent other governments from falling into it, and promote an understanding among more than just economists. Also, better understanding is an end in itself. }} by Blair Jenkins through [[EconLit]] covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that “the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves”.{{ r | 2009_econ_lit_review | p=105 | q=My review of the rent-control literature indexed by EconLit (or cited by such indexed articles) finds that economic research quite consistently and predominantly frowns on rent control. ...

There is near universal agreement that strict price ceilings, such as the kind imposed in New York City in the 1940s, are always bad because they severely inhibit housing production and investment. Even those most sympathetic to rent control seem to agree with this. }} {{ r | Forbes_RC_cities | p=1 | q=Bad ideas die hard, and rent control is no exception.

I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that "libertarian" would suit me better than many others, }} have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases [[urban blight]].{{ r | Krugman_NYT | p=1 | q=Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. }} {{ r | Sowell_EF&amp;F | p=4 | q=Rent control, for example, has been imposed in various cities around the world, with the intention of helping tenants. Almost invariably, landlords and builders of housing find the reduced range of terms less acceptable and therefore supply less housing. ... In other words, while landlords and builders simply lost an opportunity to make as much money as they could have otherwise, many tenants lost an opportunity to find a decent place to live. }} {{ r | Sowell_Salon | p=1 | q=You aren&amp;apos;t a fan of rent control? No, I&amp;apos;m not. A figure I ran across recently that struck me as illustrating the moral bankruptcy of rent control is this: The number of boarded-up housing units in New York City is four times the number of homeless people on the streets. To think of that! On winter nights there are people sleeping on the cold pavement and dying of exposure, when there are these buildings that are boarded up as a consequence of economic protectionism. }}

Price ceilings can create [[shortages]] and reduce quality when they are less than the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]].  By capping the price of housing, rent control can increase [[Supply and demand|demand]] and reduce available [[Supply and demand|supply]], causing a shortage.&lt;ref name=mankiw&gt;Mankiw, Gregory. Principles of Economics. 4th ed. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Irrelevant citation|date=October 2018}}  It is argued that rent control also reduces the quality of available housing, deters investment, and raises rents on tenants who are excluded from its protections (for example, in jurisdictions with vacancy decontrol, tenants who move or arrive later).{{Verify source|date=September 2011}}  When property owners are restricted in the rents they can charge, they are less willing to construct more housing (a form of [[capital strike]]).{{ r | SJMN_RC_new_housing | p=1 | q=David Shulman, an economist and expert on California housing, agreed that housing trends in California follow economic cycles, but said there could be trouble on the horizon should voters clear the way for strong rent control, he said. “All the rent control laws that passed previously always exempted new construction, even Berkeley and Santa Monica. Therefore it’s credible to say that housing construction would continue under rent control,” Shulman said. “Until now.” Shulman said repeal of Costa-Hawkins could send a message to developers that California is an unpredictable place to do business, and that could have an unprecedented chilling effect on development of new apartments. “That’s a legitimate fear,” Shulman said. “Cities could go back and change their laws anytime they want… This could lead to a collapse of new apartment construction.”}}  Since supply is low, landlords worry less about tenants leaving and have little incentive to maintain the property.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  For example, unless owners can reasonably expect that [[punitive]] action will be taken against them, they might let building maintenance deteriorate in order to mitigate the lower rental income.{{Verify source|date=September 2011}} People moving into the city have difficulty finding housing because of the shortage created by rent control.&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Krugman  | first = Paul  | title =  Reckonings; A Rent Affair  | newspaper = The New York Times  | date = June 7, 2000  | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF153FF934A35755C0A9669C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When housing is limited, it must be rationed in some way. After the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]], the number of houses relative to the number of people who needed housing fell by 40%, but a shortage was avoided because the market price mechanism effectively rationed housing and provided an incentive for new housing to be built. In 1946, however, a far less extreme situation was dealt with via chance and favoritehood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The natural consequence in a [[free-market]] economy is a reduction in supply and consequent shortages. Tucker has argued that rent control has the perverse effect of creating ''less'' affordable housing.&lt;ref name=Cato/&gt;

Areas with rent-controlled housing are blamed for difficulty of finding vacant housing and the resulting power imbalance between landlords and tenants as tenants may "game the system" to impose onerous conditions on the landlord, forcing long cycles of judicial action, leading to considerable economic hardship for the landlord.  Likewise, new tenants have serious difficulty finding housing, so they are seriously disadvantaged if they must move. As a result, landlords can impose numerous conditions and requirements.&lt;ref name=Krugman/&gt;

===Moral===
Rent control restricts the [[property right]]s of property owners,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; as it limits what they may do with their property, requiring petitioning and other processes by law, prior to taking action against a renter.

Because enacting rent control on a building reduces the investment return that can be expected from that building, it thereby reduces the present value of the building, which can be viewed as a partial [[expropriation]] of private property.&lt;ref&gt;"By enacting rent control legislation and thereby restricting investors in future rentals, a city may actively reduce the present value of a property.

==Academic life==
Rottenburg studied social anthropology, sociology and Arab studies (1973-1978) at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. For his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[anthropology]] he conducted 39 months of [[fieldwork]] in [[South Kordofan]] (Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazin.uni-halle.de/14469/forschen-zwischen-krieg-und-krise/ Ines Godazgar. ''Forschen zwischen Krieg und Krise.'' In: Scientia Halensis] Retrieved February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984-1987, he lectured at the University of Transkei, South Africa. Later he did research on formal organization in companies and city administrations in Europe. In the 1990s Rottenburg worked as a consultant for projects in development cooperation, carrying out research in Africa and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/personal/richard_rottenburg/publications_richard_rottenburg/ a list of his consultancy paper] Retrieved March 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These engagements provided him with the ethnographic material for his [[habilitation]], which he completed at [[Viadrina European University]] (Frankfurt/Oder) in 1999. In 2002 Rottenburg became full professor and founding director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Anthropology at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. There he established a research group around his research focus on Law, Organisation, Science and Technology (LOST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/lost/ LOST homepage at the University of Halle-Wittenberg] Retrieved January 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006-2012 he was a Max Planck Fellow, heading a project on Biomedicine in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/de/research/fellow_groups/mpfg01/bio-africa.html Homepage Biomedicine in Africa project at the MPI for Social Anthropology Halle, Germany] Retrieved January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was head or spokesperson of several research programs.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, he headed the program 'Traveling Models in Conflict Management' (2006-2009), funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

==Research interests==
In his early work, Rottenburg's focus was on the effects of so-called modern traits in African settings. In his book on the life and economic strategies of the Lemwareng ([[Moro Nuba]]) in South Kordofan (Sudan) he conceptualized processes of [[cultural syncretization]] and hybridization as ''accretion'' (Akkreszenz). Rottenburg expanded this interest throughout his career, theorizing the travel of ideas, technologies and procedures and their intercultural translation, as well as the making of objectivity and rationality in various avenues. Thereby he combines insights from Science and Technology Studies with his expertise on Africa and his ethnographic attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dasts.dk/wp-content/uploads/Concept-Paper-STSAfirca.pdf his recent activities to establish a Network for Science and Technology Studies] Retrieved March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the book '[[Far-Fetched Facts]]', an 'epistemological thriller of development aid' as a critic of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung put it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezension-sachbuch-es-muss-umgekrempelt-sein-11323422.html Book review of the German version 'Weit hergeholte Fakten', FAZ December 2, 2002] Retrieved April 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By connecting [[Social Anthropology]] to approaches from [[Science and Technology Studies]], Rottenburg is a leading figure in taking German anthropology in new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-bonn.de/~hevers/papers/Evers2004-Rottenburg.pdf Hans-Dieter Evers 2004.

==Calculation==
[[File:SPEAR concept.jpeg|thumb|Concept of SPEARpesticides]]
SPEARpesticides estimates pesticide effects and contamination. The calculation is based on monitoring data of invertebrate communities as ascertained for the [[Water Framework Directive|EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)]]. A simplified version of SPEARpesticides is included in the [http://www.fliessgewaesserbewertung.de ASTERICS] software for assessing the ecological quality of rivers. A detailed analysis is enabled by the free [http://www.systemecology.eu/spearcalc/ SPEAR Calculator]. The [http://www.systemecology.eu/spearcalc/ SPEAR Calculator] provides most recent information on species traits and allows specific user settings. 
The SPEARpesticides index is computed as relative abundance of vulnerable 'SPecies At Risk' (SPEAR) to be affected by pesticides. Relevant species traits comprises the physiological sensitivity towards pesticides, generation time, migration ability and exposure probability. The indicator value of SPEARpesticides at a sampling site is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;SPEAR_{pesticides} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i+1)y}{\sum_{i=1}^n \log (x_i+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

with n = number of taxa; x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = abundance of taxon i; y = 1 if taxon i is classified as SPEAR-sensitive; y = 0 if taxon i is classified as SPEAR-insensitive.

'''Thermostability''' is the quality of a substance to resist irreversible change in its [[Chemical structure|chemical]] or physical structure, often by resisting decomposition or polymerization, at a high relative temperature.

Thermostable materials may be used industrially as [[fire retardant]]s. A ''thermostable [[plastic]]'', an uncommon and unconventional term, is likely to refer to a [[thermosetting plastic]] that cannot be reshaped when heated, than to a [[thermoplastic]] that can be remelted and recast.

Thermostability is also a property of some proteins. To be a thermostable protein means to be resistant to changes in  [[protein structure]] due to applied heat.

==Thermostable proteins==
[[File:Process of Denaturation.svg|thumb|As heat is added, this disrupts the intramolecular bonds found in tertiary structure of proteins, causing the protein to unfold and become inactive.]]
Most life-forms on Earth live at temperatures of less than 50&amp;nbsp;°C, commonly from 15 to 50&amp;nbsp;°C. Within these organisms are macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) which form the three-dimensional structures essential to their enzymatic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandhari|first=Nitika|last2=Sinha|first2=Somdatta|date=June 26, 2017|title=Complex network analysis of thermostable mutants of Bacillus subtilis Lipase A|url=https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0039-y|journal=Applied Network Science|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=18|doi=10.1007/s41109-017-0039-y|issn=2364-8228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the native temperature of the organism, thermal energy may cause the [[Protein folding|unfolding]] and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], as the heat can disrupt the intramolecular bonds in the tertiary and quaternary structure. This unfolding will result in loss in enzymatic activity, which is understandably deleterious to continuing life-functions.  An example of such is the denaturing of proteins in [[Egg white|albumen]] from a clear, nearly colourless liquid to an opaque white, insoluble gel.

Proteins capable of withstanding such high temperatures compared to proteins that cannot, are generally from microorganisms that are hyperthermophiles. Such organisms can withstand above 50&amp;nbsp;°C temperatures as they usually live within environments of 85&amp;nbsp;°C and above.&lt;ref name="pmid8875639"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danson MJ, Hough DW, Russell RJ, Taylor GL, Pearl L | title = Enzyme thermostability and thermoactivity | journal = Protein Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–30 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8875639 | doi = 10.1093/protein/9.8.629 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Danson/publication/14330539_Enzyme_thermostability_and_thermoactivity/links/0c96051c94743de5cd000000/Enzyme-thermostability-and-thermoactivity.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[thermophile|thermophilic life-forms]] exist which can withstand temperatures above this, and have corresponding adaptations to preserve protein function at these temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takami H, Takaki Y, Chee GJ, Nishi S, Shimamura S, Suzuki H, Matsui S, Uchiyama I | title = Thermoadaptation trait revealed by the genome sequence of thermophilic Geobacillus kaustophilus | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 21 | pages = 6292–303 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15576355 | pmc = 535678 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include altered bulk properties of the cell to stabilize all proteins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neves C, da Costa MS, Santos H | title = Compatible solutes of the hyperthermophile Palaeococcus ferrophilus: osmoadaptation and thermoadaptation in the order thermococcales | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 71 | issue = 12 | pages = 8091–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16332790 | pmc = 1317470 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.71.12.8091-8098.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and specific changes to individual proteins. Comparing [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] proteins present in these thermophiles and other organisms reveal some differences in the protein structure. One notable difference is the presence of extra [[hydrogen bond]]s in the thermophile's proteins—meaning that the protein structure is more resistant to unfolding.  Similarly, thermostable proteins are rich in [[Salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] or/and extra [[Disulfide|disulfide bridges]] stabilizing the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Das R, Gerstein M | title = The stability of thermophilic proteins: a study based on comprehensive genome comparison | journal = Functional &amp; Integrative Genomics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–88 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 11793224 | doi = 10.1007/s101420000003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumura M, Becktel WJ, Levitt M, Matthews BW | title = Stabilization of phage T4 lysozyme by engineered disulfide bonds | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 86 | issue = 17 | pages = 6562–6 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2671995 | pmc = 297884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors of protein thermostability are compactness of protein structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson MJ, Eisenberg D | title = Transproteomic evidence of a loop-deletion mechanism for enhancing protein thermostability | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 290 | issue = 2 | pages = 595–604 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10390356 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oligomerization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanaka Y, Tsumoto K, Yasutake Y, Umetsu M, Yao M, Fukada H, Tanaka I, Kumagai I | title = How oligomerization contributes to the thermostability of an archaeon protein.

=== Uses and Applications of Thermostable Proteins ===

==== Polymerase Chain Reactions ====
Thermostable [[enzyme]]s such as [[Taq polymerase]] and [[Pfu DNA polymerase]] are used in [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) where temperatures of 94&amp;nbsp;°C or over are used to melt apart [[DNA]] strands in the denaturation step of PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saiki RK, Gelfand DH, Stoffel S, Scharf SJ, Higuchi R, Horn GT, Mullis KB, Erlich HA | title = Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 239 | issue = 4839 | pages = 487–91 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 2448875 | doi = 10.1126/science.2448875 | bibcode = 1988Sci...239..487S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resistance to high temperature allows for DNA polymerase to elongate  DNA with a desired sequence of interest with the presence of dNTP's.

==== Protein Purification ====
Knowledge of an enzyme's resistance to high temperatures is especially beneficial in [[protein purification]]. In the procedure of heat denaturation, one can subject a mixture of proteins to high temperatures, which will result in the denaturation of proteins that are not thermostable, and the isolation of the protein that is thermodynamically stable. One notable example of this is found in the purification of [[alkaline phosphatase]] from the hyperthermophile ''[[Pyrococcus abyssi]]''. This enzyme is known for being heat stable at temperatures greater than 95&amp;nbsp;°C, and therefore can be partially purified by heating when heterologously expressed in ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zappa S, Rolland JL, Flament D, Gueguen Y, Boudrant J, Dietrich J | title = Characterization of a highly thermostable alkaline phosphatase from the euryarchaeon Pyrococcus abyssi | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 67 | issue = 10 | pages = 4504–11 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11571149 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.67.10.4504-4511.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in temperature causes the ''E. coli'' proteins to precipitate, while the ''P. abyssi'' alkaline phosphatase remains stably in solution.

==== Glycoside Hydrolases ====
Another important group of thermostable enzymes are [[glycoside hydrolases]]. These enzymes are responsible of the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, the polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thus, [[glycoside hydrolases]] are gaining great interest in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=|year=2014|author1=Linares-Pastén|first1=J. A.|title=Thermostable glycoside hydrolases in biorefinery technologies|journal=Current Biotechnology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=26–44|last2=Andersson|first2=M |last3=Nordberg karlsson|first3=E|doi=10.2174/22115501113026660041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are the production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as carbon source for microbial conversion in fuels (ethanol) and chemical intermediates, production of oligosaccharides for prebiotic applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type. All of these processes often involve thermal treatments to facilitate the polysaccharide hydrolysis, hence give thermostable variants of [[glycoside hydrolases]] an important role in this context.

===Approaches to improve thermostability of proteins===
[[Protein engineering]] can be used to enhance the thermostability of proteins. A number of [[site-directed mutagenesis|site-directed]] and [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)#random mutagenesis|random mutagenesis]] techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarkar CA, Dodevski I, Kenig M, Dudli S, Mohr A, Hermans E, Plückthun A | title = Directed evolution of a G protein-coupled receptor for expression, stability, and binding selectivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 39 | pages = 14808–13 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18812512 | pmc = 2567449 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0803103105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10514808S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asial I, Cheng YX, Engman H, Dollhopf M, Wu B, Nordlund P, Cornvik T | title = Engineering protein thermostability using a generic activity-independent biophysical screen inside the cell | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | pages = 2901 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24352381 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3901 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2901A }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to [[directed evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoseki J, Yano T, Koyama Y, Kuramitsu S, Kagamiyama H | title = Directed evolution of thermostable kanamycin-resistance gene: a convenient selection marker for Thermus thermophilus | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 951–6 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10544290 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used to increase the thermostability of target proteins.

These forces include hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and the presence of disulfide bonds. The overall amount of hydrophobicity present in a particular protein is responsible for its thermostability. Another type of force that is responsible for thermostability of a protein is the electrostatic interactions between molecules. These interactions include salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Salt bridges are unaffected by high temperatures, therefore, are necessary for protein and enzyme stability. A third force used to increase thermosability in proteins and enzymes is the presence of disulfide bonds. They present covalent cross-linkages between the polypeptide chains. These bonds are the strongest because they’re covalent bonds, making them stronger than intermolecular forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tigerström|first=Anna|date=2005|title=Thermostability of Proteins|jstor=4608725|journal=Bios|volume=76|issue=1|pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermostable toxins==
Certain [[poison]]ous [[Fungus|fungi]] contain thermostable [[toxin]]s, such as [[amatoxin]] found in the [[death cap]] and [[Galerina|autumn skullcap]] [[mushroom]]s and [[patulin]] from molds. Therefore, applying heat to these will not remove the toxicity and is of particular concern for food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA: Moldy applesauce repackaged by school lunch supplier|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/04/8636308-fda-moldy-applesauce-repackaged-by-school-lunch-supplier?lite|website=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|access-date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wallops Flight Facility''' ('''WFF''') {{Airport codes|WAL|KWAL|WAL}}, located on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]] of [[Virginia]], [[United States]], approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} north-northeast of [[Norfolk, VA|Norfolk]], is operated by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], primarily as a [[rocket launch site]] to support science and exploration missions for [[NASA]] and other Federal agencies. WFF includes an extensively instrumented range to support launches of more than a dozen types of [[sounding rocket]]s; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/vehicles.html |title=Sounding Rocket Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/mpl/elvs.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicles |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-altitude balloon]] flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research; and, using its Research Airport, [[flight test]]s of aeronautical research aircraft, including [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

There have been over 16,000 launches from the rocket testing range at Wallops since its founding in 1945 in the quest for information on the flight characteristics of airplanes, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, and to increase the knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere and the environment of [[outer space]]. The launch vehicles vary in size and power from the small [[Super Loki]] meteorological rockets to orbital-class vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=NFIRE |publisher=Nasa Wallops Flight Facility |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219225204/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code840/news/Wallops_Range_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |title=Overview |publisher=Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213040/http://www.marsspaceport.com/mid-atlantic-spaceport-mission |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/astrosociety/aas-goddard-201103301230wrobel |title=Activities at Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=American Astronautical Society |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallops Flight Facility also supports science missions for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and occasionally for foreign governments and commercial organizations. Wallops also supports development tests and exercises involving [[United States Navy]] aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon systems in the [[Virginia Capes]] operating area, near the entrance to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile [[radar]], [[telemetry]] receivers, and command transmitters that can be transported by [[cargo plane]]s to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.

The WFF mobile range assets have been used to support rocket launches from locations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, [[South America]], Africa, Europe, [[Australia]], and at sea. Workers at Wallops include approximately 1,000 full-time  NASA [[civil service]] employees and the employees of contractors, about 30 [[U.S. Navy]] personnel, and about 100 employees of NOAA.

== History ==

In 1945, NASA's predecessor agency, the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), established a rocket launch site on [[Wallops Island]] under the direction of the [[Langley Research Center]]. This site was designated the '''Pilotless Aircraft Research Station''' and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station became a separate facility, '''Wallops Station''', operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In 1959, NASA acquired the former '''[[Naval Air Station Chincoteague]]''', and engineering and administrative activities were moved to this location. In 1974, the Wallops Station was named '''Wallops Flight Center'''. The name was changed to '''Wallops Flight Facility''' in 1981, when it became part of Goddard Space Flight Center.

In the early years, research at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |title=Project Mercury Overview |publisher=Nasa Kennedy Space Centre |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603211738/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/mercury-overview.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; capsules were tested at Wallops in support of NASA's manned space flight program - the [[Mercury program]] - before astronauts were launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida. Some of these tests using the [[Little Joe (rocket)|Little Joe]] [[booster rocket]] were designed to [[flight-qualify]] components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems and some of the life support systems. Two [[rhesus monkey]]s, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.

The first payload launched into orbit from Wallops Island was [[Explorer 9|Explorer IX]], atop a [[Scout rocket]], on February 15, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Myler, Joseph L. "7-Mile Salt Marsh, Sand Strip in Virginia Oldest, Tiniest Spaceport in U.S." (March 16, 1961), UPI via ''The Middlesboro Daily News", p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ([[LADEE]]) was launched from Wallops, atop a [[Minotaur V]] rocket. This was the first time that an American lunar mission had been launched from anywhere but [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.space.com/22673-nasa-ladee-moon-launch-webcast.html NASA Launch Shoots for the Moon from Virginia Tonight: Watch It Online]", Space.com, September 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallops Island is currently experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, due in part to the [[current sea level rise]]; some access roads and parking lots have had to be rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/waters-edge-the-crisis-of-rising-sea-levels/ |title=As the seas rise, a slow-motion disaster gnaws at America’s shores |last1=McNeill |first1=Ryan |last2=Nelson |first2=Deborah J. |date=4 September 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent ground control station for NASA's [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] drone is at Wallops Flight Facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/virginia/2016/06/24/navy-triton-drones-wallops/86332348/ 3 governors, 1 mission: Bring drones to Wallops] Retrieved June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==

[[Image:08-WFF Airspace.jpg|thumb|upright]]

The WFF Main Base is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Chincoteague, Virginia]]; about {{convert|90|mi|km}} north of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and {{convert|40|mi|km}} southeast of [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. The WFF consists of three separate parcels of land totaling 6,200 [[acres]] (25&amp;nbsp;km²): the Main Base, the Mainland, and the Wallops Island Launch Site. The Mainland and the Wallops Island Launch Site are about {{convert|7|mi|km}} southeast of the Main Base.

=== Airspace ===

Wallops operates [[controlled airspace]] with [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) qualified [[air traffic controller]]s including:

* The WFF Airport Control Zone to {{convert|2500|ft|m}} within a {{convert|5|smi|km|adj=on}} radius of the airport
* Restricted Area R-6604 connecting WFF airspace and offshore warning areas.

=== Fixed facilities ===

Major Wallops facilities include FAA-certified [[runway]]s; an experimental UAV runway; and crash, fire and rescue services. WFF has facilities for the receipt, inspection, assembly, checkout and storage of [[rocket motor]]s and other hazardous [[pyrotechnic device]]s. The Wallops Island Launch Site includes six [[launch pad]]s, three [[blockhouse]]s for launch control, and assembly buildings to support the preparation and launching of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles.

[[Image:03-WFF Launch Range Map.png|thumb|left|The NASA Wallops Flight Facility Range]]

The Wallops Research Range includes ground-based and mobile systems, and a range control center. Its radar facilities and systems are used for tracking and surveillance. Telemetry facilities include a variety of antennas, receivers, and display instrumentation systems. Command uplink and optical tracking facilities are included as part of the range. The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight and test operations.

The WFF Research Airport is located on the Main Base. There are three runways (from {{convert|4810|ft|m}} to {{convert|8750|ft|m}} long), two [[taxiway]]s, three ramps, and one hazardous cargo loading area in active service. Two ramps adjoin the two active hangars, and a third ramp adjoins the Crash, Fire and Rescue building. The primary research runway has a test section with a variety of surface textures and materials for runway research projects.

Weather measurements and predictions are critical to all Research Airport operations, rocket and balloon launches, and in safely conducting hazardous operations on the ground. Wallops meteorological services provide measurements of upper atmospheric and magnetic phenomena to augment and enable collection of scientific data by sensors aboard flight vehicles. The [[S-band]] [[Doppler radar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Philip A. Ingwersen and William Z.

It can detect a single raindrop of 3 millimeters at a range of 10 kilometers and cloud water content as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram per cubic meter. SPANDAR’s sensitivity with its {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} dish antenna can detect small changes in the [[refractive index]] of air caused by sea breeze fronts, gust fronts, and various forms of [[clear air turbulence]].

=== Mobile systems ===

[[Image:16-WFF Launch Locations.jpg|thumb|right|The NASA Wallops Mobile Range instrumentation has been deployed to support launch events in dozens of locations around the world.]]

The Wallops mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at [[Poker Flat]], [[Alaska]]; [[Andoya]], [[Norway]]; and [[Kwajalein]] Island, [[Marshall Islands]]. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] networks and can be used to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.

== Range technology development ==

[[Image:18-WFF Future Range.jpg|thumb|right|Envisioned Future Range Architecture]]

Since 2001, engineers at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches to improve the cost and responsiveness of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.

Specifically, NASA Wallops has been leading two range technology development projects: the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035930/http://artwg.ksc.nasa.gov/Media/10_AFSS_%26_LCTT.pdf Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) and the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT2)].

AFSS is a project to develop an autonomous on-board system that could augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.

LCT2 is an effort to produce a relatively low-cost transceiver to allow launch vehicles to communicate through NASA's [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] (TDRSS) after they have gone over the horizon from the launch site. LCT2 is being pursued as part of the Space Based Range Demonstration and Certification (SBRDC) program (formerly called [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712035931/http://www.spacecongress.org/2004/1a-denson.pdf Space Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS)]) in cooperation with NASA [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html Kennedy Space Center].

== Commercial spaceport ==

In 1998, the [[Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority]], later joined by [[Maryland]], built the [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] at Wallops on land leased from NASA. In December 2006, the facility made its first launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-12-16-commercialrocket_x.htm?POE=TECISVA |title=Mid-Atlantic commercial spaceport makes 1st launch |date= December 16, 2006 |publisher=USATODAY |accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitor center==
[[File:NASA Visitor Center at Wallops Flight Facility 002 crop.jpg|thumb|right|NASA Visitor Center at Wallops Flight Facility]]
The [[NASA Visitor Center (Wallops Flight Facility)|Wallops Visitor Center]] has a variety of hands-on exhibits and hosts weekly educational activities and programs to enable children to explore and learn about the technologies designed and used by NASA researchers and scientists. In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites [[model rocketry]] enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF rocket launch site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the [[spacecraft]] they carry in real life.

The schedule for sounding rocket launches from WFF is posted on its official Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/ |title=NASA's Wallops Flight Facility |publisher=Nasa |accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
For many years WFF was home to the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four experiments that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.

==Accidents==

On April 2, 1957, a [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-6 Neptune]] exploded in midair after takeoff from what was then known as [[NAAS Chincoteague]]. All eleven occupants of the aircraft died. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19570402-2|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 1995, the maiden flight of a [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga 1620 rocket]] failed 46 seconds after liftoff, resulting in disintegration. [[Space Services Inc.|EER Space Systems]], Conestoga's manufacturer, concluded that low frequency noise from an unknown source upset the guidance system on the rocket causing it to order course corrections when none were needed. The rocket went off course when its first stage steering mechanism ran out of hydraulic fluid and became inoperable. After this failure, the Conestoga program was terminated, and EER abandoned the launch business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga 1620|url=http://www.astronautix.com/c/conestoga1620.html|website=astronautix.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conestoga|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/conestoga.htm|website=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the launch, the Conestoga was the largest rocket ever launched from Wallops Island, and it was the first orbital mission attempted from the facility since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roylance|first1=Frank|title=Rocket explodes above Wallops Malfunction ends first commercial flight from NASA center|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-24/news/1995297106_1_rocket-eer-spacecraft|website=baltimoresun.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|launch pad]] at Wallops Island were the first commercially built facilities in the US. 14 scientific experiments, some of which were planned to return from orbit, were destroyed. All debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean. There were no injuries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrasekaran|first1=Rajiv|title=Rocket explodes off VA.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/10/24/rocket-explodes-off-va/2f8b50ba-6b00-4682-ad42-b1a126ee3cad/?utm_term=.2c93a158fee2|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 1998 a [[Learjet 45]] was destroyed at Wallops after a loss of control during a water ingestion test flight. Only minor injuries to a copilot and flight engineer were reported. There were no ground injuries. The airplane was being used to test a new nose wheel tire. For the test, the airplane was passed through a "pool" or "trough" of water on the runway at different speeds. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTSB Identification: IAD99FA008|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001211X11269&amp;ntsbno=IAD99FA008&amp;akey=1|website=ntsb.gov|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot failed to obtain/maintain alignment with the water pool and lost control.

On October 28, 2014, a failure occurred in an [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] rocket, carrying [[Cygnus CRS Orb-3]], shortly after launch and destroyed both the rocket and the payload at the adjacent [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] on [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|Launch Pad 0A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Mike|title=Private Orbital Sciences Rocket Explodes During Launch, NASA Cargo Lost|url=http://www.space.com/27576-private-orbital-sciences-rocket-explosion.html|website=space.com|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">The '''Wayqecha Biological Station''' is a [[tropical ecology|tropical ecological]] [[research station]] near [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]]. This research station is located (13°10'38.06"S, 71°36'16.36"W) in the upper reaches of the river Cosñipata, an affluent of the [[Madre de Dios River]], in the [[Paucartambo Province]], [[Cusco Region]].  The station ranges from 2200 to 3700 m in elevation and includes several Andean [[ecosystem]]s, such as montane forests, elfin forests, montane scrub and high-Andean grassland ([[Puna grassland|puna]]). These ecosystems are connected by a series of trails and by the road Paucartambo-Shintuya. The station was established in 2005 and is managed by two non-governmental organizations: the Peruvian NGO Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica (ACCA) and the US-based [[Amazon Conservation Association]] (ACA), which also manage the [[Los Amigos Biological Station]] in the lowland rainforest of southeastern Peru.  

Current research at Wayqecha includes a multidisciplinary project studying [[Carbon cycle|carbon cycling]] in soils and montane forests and their response to [[climate change]], and  studies of plant and animal diversity patterns along the Andean elevational gradient. Wayqecha hosted a field course of the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] in 2007.

==Access==
Wayqecha is located along the Paucartambo-Shintuya road, approximately 1 hour east of Paucartambo and 4–5 hours east of [[Cusco]], the nearest city.

A '''young adult''' is generally a person ranging in age from their late teens or early twenties to their thirties, although definitions and opinions, such as [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of human development]], vary. The young [[adult]] stage in human development precedes [[middle age|middle adulthood]]. A person in the middle adulthood stage ages from 40 or 41 to 64. In [[old age]], a person is 65 years old or older.&lt;ref name="Martin Briner"&gt;Martin Briner, [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm Erik Erikson page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821183134/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, 1999, on Briner's [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm site about learning theories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007042838/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm |date=2006-10-07 }}, USMA Department of Mathematical Sciences, Center for Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), United States Military Academy at West Point. Accessed 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time co-ordinates==
For a variety of reasons, timeliness on young adulthood cannot be exactly defined—producing different results according to the different mix of overlapping indices (legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional and the like) employed, or on whether 'a ''developmental perspective''... [or] the ''socialization perspective''&lt;ref name=Levinson1986&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel J. |title=A conception of adult development |journal=American Psychologist |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is taken. 'Sub-phases in this timetable of psychosocial growth patterns... are not rigid, and both social change and individual variations must be taken into account'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}—not to mention regional and cultural differences. Arguably indeed, with people living longer, and also reaching puberty earlier, 'age norms for major life events have become highly elastic'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=15}} by the twenty-first century.

Some have suggested that, after {{'}}''Pre-adulthood''... in the first 20 years or so... the second era, ''Early Adulthood'', lasts from about age 17 to 45... the adult era of greatest energy and abundance and of greatest contradiction and stress.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; Within that framework, 'the ''Early Adult Transition'' (17–22) is a developmental bridge between pre-adulthood and early adulthood',&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; recognizing that 'the transition into adulthood is not a clear-cut dividing line'.{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} One might alternatively speak of 'a ''Provisional Adulthood (18–30)''... [&amp;] the initiation to First Adulthood'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}} as following that.

Despite all such fluidity, there is broad agreement that it is essentially the twenties and thirties which constitute {{'}}''Early adulthood''... the basis for what [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] calls ''the Dream''—a vision of his [or her] goal's in life which provide motivation and enthusiasm for the future'.{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=220}}

==Health==
Young/prime adulthood can be considered the healthiest time of life{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} and young adults are generally in good health, subject neither to [[disease]] nor the problems of [[senescence]]. Strength and [[Physical fitness|physical performance]] reach their peak from 18–39 years of age.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarpenning KM, Hamilton-Wessler M, Wiswell RA, Hawkins SA |title=Endurance training delays age of decline in leg strength and muscle morphology |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=74–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14707771 |doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000106179.73735.A6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knechtle B, Rüst CA, Rosemann T, Lepers R |title=Age-related changes in 100-km ultra-marathon running performance |journal=Age |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=1033–45 |year=2012 |pmid=21796378 |pmc=3682063 |doi=10.1007/s11357-011-9290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] may decrease with age throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Association of Flexibility, Balance, and Lumbar Strength with Balance Ability: Risk of Falls in Older Adults|first1=Emilio J.

In [[developed countries]], [[mortality rate]]s for the 18–40 age group are typically very low. Men are more likely to die at this age than women, particularly in the 18–25 group: reasons include [[car accidents]] and [[suicide]]. Mortality statistics among men and women level off during the late twenties and thirties, due in part to good health and less [[recklessness (psychology)|risk-taking behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Life Expectancy Profiles  | work =  | publisher = BBC  | date=   6 June 2005  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3784854  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding disease, [[cancer]] is much less common in young than in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = UK cancer mortality statistics by age| publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/mortality/age/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are [[testicular cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Cancers at a glance | publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/cancers/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] has hit the early adult population particularly hard. According to a [[United Nations]] report, AIDS has significantly increased mortality of between ages 20 to 55 for African males and 20 to 45 for African females, reducing the [[life expectancy]] in South Africa by 18 years and in Botswana by 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Ngom, Pierre  |author2=Clark, Samuel   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Adult Mortality In The Era Of HIV/AIDS: Sub-Saharan Africa  | publisher = Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations Secretariat  | date=  18 August 2003 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adultmort/CLARK_Paper3.pdf  | format = pdf  | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adulthood==
According to Erikson, in the wake of the adolescent emphasis upon [[identity formation]], 'the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He [or she] is ready for [[intimacy]], that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=255}} To do so means the ability 'to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and [[sex|sexual unions]], in close friendships and in physical combat'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}} Avoidance of such experiences 'because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of [[solitude|isolation]] and consequent self-absorption'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}}

Where isolation is avoided, the young adult may find instead that 'satisfactory sex relations... in some way take the edge off the hostilities and potential rages caused by the oppositeness of male and female, of fact and fancy, of [[love]] and hate';{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=257}} and may grow into the ability to exchange intimacy, love and [[compassion]].

In modern societies, young adults in their late teens and early 20s encounter a number of issues as they finish school and begin to hold full-time jobs and take on other responsibilities of adulthood; and 'the young adult is usually preoccupied with self-growth in the context of society and relationships with others.'{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=227}} The danger is that in 'the second era, ''Early Adulthood''... we must make crucially important choices regarding marriage, family, work, and lifestyle before we have the maturity or life experience to choose wisely.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

While 'young adulthood is filled with avid quests for intimate relationships and other major commitments involving career and life goals', there is also "a parallel pursuit for the formulation of a set of moral values".{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=298}} Erikson has argued that it is only now that what he calls the 'ideological mind' of adolescence gives way to 'that ''[[Ethics|ethical]] sense'' which is the mark of the adult.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|pp=254–6}}

Reaching adulthood in modern society is not always a linear or clean transition. As generations continue to adapt, new markers of adulthood are created that add different social expectations of what it means to be an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandegrift |first1=Darcie |title='We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=221–36 |doi=10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age 30 transition==

Daniel Levinson suggested that the first phase of early adulthood comes to a close around twenty-eight to thirty, when 'at about 28 the provisional character of the twenties is ending and life is becoming more serious... the ''age-thirty crisis''.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; between age 28 and 32', stressing that 'it is not uncommon, at the approach to the thirties, to tear up the life structure one put together to support the original dream of the twenties,'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=47}} and to start anew—'to create the basis for the next life structure.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;
When 'the Age Thirty Transition' is a difficult one, 'in a severe crisis [s/]he experiences a threat to life itself, the danger of chaos and dissolution, the loss of hope for the future.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

==Settling down==
After the relative upheaval of the early 30s, the middle to late 30s are often characterized by '''settling down''': 'the establishment phase', involving 'what we would call ''major life investments''—work, family, friends, community activities, and values.'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=72}} What has been termed 'the ''Culminating Life Structure for Early Adulthood'' (33–40) is the vehicle for completing this era and realizing our youthful aspirations.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; People in their thirties may increase the financial and emotional investments they make in their lives, and may have been employed long enough to gain promotions and raises. They often become more focused on advancing their careers and gaining stability in their personal lives—'with marriage and child-rearing,'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}} starting a [[family]], coming to the fore as priorities.

[[Gail Sheehy]], however, signposts the same twenties/thirties division rather differently, arguing that nowadays 'the twenties have stretched out into a long Provisional Adulthood', and that in fact 'the transition to the Turbulent Thirties marks the initiation to First Adulthood.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}}

==Midlife transition==

Young Adulthood then draws to its close with 'the ''Midlife Transition'', from roughly age 40 to 45'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;—producing 'a brand-new passage in the forties, when First Adulthood ends and Second Adulthood begins.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=14}}

'''''The Zen of Screaming''''' is an instructional DVD by [[Melissa Cross]], a vocal coach whose speciality is "unclean" vocal techniques such as [[Death growl|growled]] or [[Screaming Vocals|screamed]] found in [[extreme metal]] and other styles of music. In contrast, "clean" vocals are relatively more conventional singing techniques. 

The DVD is intended to help vocalists learn how to strengthen their bodies so they can perform vocals without damaging their vocal cords. On the DVD many guest musicians, such as [[Randy Blythe]] of [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], appear to demonstrate the exercises.

Other pupils of Melissa Cross have been the lead vocalists for famous heavy metal bands such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], [[Shadows Fall]], [[Underoath]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Madball]], [[God Forbid]], and [[Andrew W.K.]]
