'''ADMAR''' – stays for the German wording '''Abgesetzte Darstellung von MADAP Radar data''' and was the predecessor product of [[CIMACT]]. 

== Definition ==
The [[EUROCONTROL]] software product ADMAR did combine and merge several [[Secondary surveillance radar| civilian surveillance- and military sensor]] data sources with [[Flight plan]] data sources. After data correlation it was able to provide a [[Recognized Air Picture|Recognised Air Picture (RAP)]]. It could be operated on [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] hardware or special [[Information Technology|IT]]. 

== History ==
ADMAR was developed on the basis of ADKAR and GAME footing on the special Agreement of [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|MOD Germany]] ({{lang|de|BMVg}}  – A/13/D/HG/82, April 18, 1983) in cooperation with EUROCONTROL. It has been operational since 1983 and was used by the [[German Air Force]] exclusively. Since 2003 it became of interest for other European countries, [[NATO]] and security related authorities and organisations as well. ''ADMAR 2000'' was the final software release.   

Remark:
*MADAP - Maastricht Automatic Data Processing system
*ADKAR - Abgesetzte Darstellung von KARLDAP Radar-Daten
*KARLDAP - Karlsruhe Automatic Data Processing system
*GAME - GEADGE / ADKAR Message Exchange
*GEADGE - German Air Defence Ground Environment

== Utilisation ==
In Germany the utilisation of ADMAR was as follows:
* Stationary Control and Reporting Centre (CRC), TACCS
* Operation Centre National Air Defence (de: Nationales Lage- und Führungszentrum für Sicherheit im Luftraum - NLFZ SiLuRa) 
* General Air Force Office (de: Luftwaffenamt)

Akvo is a [[not-for-profit]]  internet and software developer, headquartered in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The foundation specializes primarily in building and operating data collection and visualization systems to be used in [[international development]] and [[aid]] activity. Akvo also operates the sustainable development wiki Akvopedia, which as of 2017 has 1956 content pages about water, sanitation and agriculture. Akvo was initially started as a project under the Netherlands Water Partnership in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dutchwatersector.com |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akvo operates from 11 offices worldwide. Akvo has hub offices based in a number of different locations, including [[Stockholm]], [[London]], [[Washington DC]], [[Nairobi]] and [[New Delhi]]. As of 2017, Akvo operates in 93 countries and works with more than 1800 organizations around the world from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to national governments and multilateral aid organizations who use Akvo’s tools to report, publish, monitor and evaluate their work.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"&gt;[http://ethiopia.nlembassy.org/binaries/content/assets/postenweb/e/ethiopie/netherlands-embassy-in-addis-ababa/services/general-information/ekn-water-directory.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the foundation's work is concentrated within the water and sanitation sector. However, since 2010 it has widened its focus to areas such as health, education, technology, agriculture and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/about-us/akvo-faq/#whywatsan |title=Akvo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's mission is "to build a highly effective, open, online platform and a trusted partner network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akvo.org/uploads/2012/12/Akvo_staff-handbook_20151.pdf |format=PDF |title=AKVO Handbook |website=Akvo.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson and Jeroen van der Sommen met at Stockholm [[World Water Week]] in 2006. At this time it was becoming clear that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] on water was going to be difficult to achieve and as a result there was the need to develop new ideas. Shortly thereafter, the idea of using open source software and open data for the development sector was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring-water-aid-projects.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 2008 the Akvo Foundation was formed by the [[Netherlands Water Partnership]] and several other co founders, including Bjelkeman-Pettersson and van der Sommen as well as Mark Nitzberg, Mark Charmer, Gabriel von Heijne and Peter van der Linde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vn.nl/thomas-bjelkeman-pettersson/ |title=Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson - Vrij Nederland |website=Vn.nl |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Early timeline'''

September 2006 - Seed funding is provided by Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP). The partner organisations that participate in brainstorming about what Akvo should become are [[UNESCO]]-IHE, IRC International Resource Centre for Water and Sanitation (IRC) and the Movement Design Bureau.

April 2007 – Partners for Water and NWP provide the first batch of funding.

August 2007 – Akvopedia is shown for the first time at World Water Week.

In 2015, Akvo was named as the winner of the [[Water and Sanitation Award]]. The award was in recognition of Akvo’s innovation within the water and sanitation sector in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadb.org/es/noticias/comunicados-de-prensa/2015-11-17/ganadores-premio-bid-femsa,11324.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail_Short_11324&amp;wtSrc=Email&amp;wtType=Short&amp;wtArticleID=11324&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in November 2015, Akvo was awarded the [[Dutch Water Innovation Prize]]. Akvo won the award for the development of a smart irrigation inlet sensor that measures the salinity of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uvw.nl/waterinnovatieprijs-2015-uitgereikt/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Akvo designs and builds Software as a Service software as well as offering services that complement them, such as training and consulting. All Akvo's software is released as open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://github.com/akvo | title=Akvo Foundation on GitHub| date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvo's tools are designed to work together at each stage of the monitoring cycle and therefore have three main purposes: first, capture and collect data;  second, understand this data and turn it into decisions; and third, share this data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://afrialliance.org/news/smart-solutions-for-water-and-climate/ |title=» Smart Solutions for Water and Climate |website=Afrialliance.org |date=2017-03-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations that use Akvo services include [[UNDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id.undp.org/content/indonesia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/08/26/training-the-trainers-with-our-diy-survey-app-what-happens-next-.html |title=Training the trainers with our DIY survey app. What happens next? &amp;#124; UNDP in Indonesia |website=Id.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/1852_23490.html |title=UNICEF Pacific Island Countries - Latest stories - UNICEF Pacific works with Ministry of Health &amp; Medical Services, towards increasing capacity for monitoring of WASH activities |website=Unicef.org |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other NGOs and governments.

'''Akvo Flow''' (Field Level Operation Watch) allows field surveys to be managed and carried out using mobile phones. It can be used to collect, manage, analyse and display geographically-referenced monitoring and evaluation data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.org/update/akvo-flow-smart-technology-smart-development |title=Akvo FLOW: SMART technology for SMART Development &amp;#124; SNV World |website=Snv.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow was originally developed by Water for People.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks |first=Ken |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2012/01/24/the-cellphone-that-keeps-the-water-and-data-flowing/ |title=The Cellphone that Keeps the Water, and Data, Flowing – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Water for People partnered with Akvo to allow for wider use of the system and Akvo took over the development of Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/blog/akvo-and-water-for-people-sign-flow-agreement/ |title=Akvo and Water For People sign FLOW agreement |website=Akvo.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Flow was used primarily in water and sanitation projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Matthew |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/22/health/water-sanitation-mobile/index.html?hpt=hp_c3 |title=Going with the 'FLOW' towards better sanitation - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has more recently been used in a variety of fields, including fisheries management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/mar/01/social-impacts-of-marine-protection-in-indonesia-in-pictures?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco |title=Living in Indonesia's marine protected areas - in pictures &amp;#124; Environment |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; school management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://unicefpacific.blogspot.se/2015/09/champions-for-healthy-schools.html |title=Pacific Island Countries: Champions for healthy schools |website=Unicefpacific.blogspot.se |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disaster relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q5dqz |title=BBC World Service - Click, Rebuilding Vanuatu with Smartphones |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, 3.990.763 data points have been captured with Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/seeithappen/ |title=See it happen |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo RSR''' (Really Simple Reporting) was launched in September 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/38f27bf8-4a54-11de-8e7e-00144feabdc0 |title=Donor programmes: Sponsors can now view benefits online |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first product Akvo developed; it is a content management and reporting system for international development projects. It was described by Giulio Quaggiotto of the World Bank as "Real-time, paper-free, straight from the trenches reporting. If RSR takes off, it could be the killer application of Development 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/forget-rss-is-real-simple-reporting-the-killer-development-20-application |title=Forget RSS: is Real Simple Reporting the killer Development 2.0 application? &amp;#124; Private Sector Development |website=Blogs.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 4000 projects on the platform, with a combined value of over €150 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/akvo-rsr-supporting-use-of-open-data |title=Akvo RSR: Supporting use of Open Data &amp;#124; International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) |website=Aidtransparency.net |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvopedia''' was created in 2007 and was the first project that Akvo worked on. It is a Web-based, free content, water and sanitation knowledge resource. Akvopedia is written collaboratively by volunteers and specialists, mainly from the water and sanitation sector but anyone can edit and contribute. It is organised within five portals – Water, Sanitation, Finance, Sustainability and Decision &amp; assessment tools. Recently some of this content has been transferred to Wikiversity in the Rainwater Harvesting portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting |title=Rainwater harvesting - Wikiversity |publisher=En.wikiversity.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Sites''' is a [[Wordpress]] based system for easy creation and maintenance of websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/products/akvo-sites/ |title=Akvo Sites |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Caddisfly''' is a [[water quality]] and [[soil quality]] testing system based on [[smartphones]]. Akvo Caddisfly was originally invented by Ternup Research Labs to detect the precedes of [[fluoride]] in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553 |title=Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.156 |volume=551-552 |journal=Science of the Total Environment |pages=101–107 | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saurabh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternup joined forces with Akvo in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caddisfly.ternup.com/partnering-with-akvo/ |title=Partnering with Akvo &amp;#124; Caddisfly |website=Caddisfly.ternup.com |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddisfly system has been extended to work with strip tests and phone-connected sensors as well as the original colorimetric tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/akvo-caddisfly/ |title=Akvo Caddisfly |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Lumen''' is a data visualisation platform and is Akvo's latest product. It is developed in the [[Clojure]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/clojure-in-akvo.html |title=JUXT Blog: Clojure in Europe: Akvo |website=Juxt.pro |date=2016-05-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovative communication ==
Akvo has gained notoriety for its unique external communication. Bruce Sterling said "It's an open-source sanitation project, and if that isn’t weird enough, they’ve got a Bollywood-parody promotional angle." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/06/akvos-bollywood/ |title=Akvo’s Bollywood Angle |publisher=WIRED |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Geographic Society]] reported from [[World Water Week in Stockholm]] about the WaterCube, the brainchild of Mark Charmer at Akvo: "Man-on-the-street journalism meets wonky water week. Frenetic water cube workers ushered a steady stream of conference attendees into their fishbowl lounge for quick Flip camera interviews. The close-ups may not be flattering, but it is interesting to hear the stream of consciousness that pours from the mouths of the unprepared and unedited. From high-profile corporate and academic leadership to those implementing projects on the ground around the world, the resulting online mosaic of more than 200 interviews collected over the last two years seems to present a near-complete view of the issues covered over six days of workshops, plenary sessions, and panels." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell |first=David |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2010/09/09/world-water-week-best-design/ |title=World Water Week: Best in Design – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent notable projects and partnerships ==
'''Akvopedia expands into Wikiversity:''' In 2015, Akvopedia begun loading content into [[Wikiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.susana.org/component/kunena/196-capacity-development/15007-akvopedia-expands-into-wikiversity-which-offers-free-learning-materials-starting-with-rainwater-harvesting-section |title=SuSanA Forum |website=Forum.susana.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvopedia has served as source content for the Wikiversity portal and the [[Rainwater harvesting portal]].

'''Monitoring water points during drought in Ethiopia:''' In 2016, Akvo worked with UNICEF to collect data during the worst drought in over 50 years in Ethiopia. Akvo recorded over 80,000 survey responses which were used to help direct emergency resources to the most relevant areas.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"/&gt;

'''Supporting Government disaster planning and response systems:''' Since 2014, Akvo has worked in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to introduce locally run mobile-based data and asset management tools to improve the quality and availability of data for disaster-related decision-making.  For this work Akvo won the innovationXchange award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org/winners/#VanuatuDRPlatform |title=Innovators - InnovationXchange |website=Pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Akvo Flow was used in Fiji to collect data on the extent of the damage caused by [[Cyclone Winston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/UNICEF_Pacific_Cyclone_Winston_External_SitRep_26Feb2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cyclone Winston : Fiji : UNICEF Report |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amazon Mechanical Turk''' ('''MTurk''') is a [[crowdsourcing]] [[Internet]] [[marketplace]] enabling individuals and businesses (known as Requesters) to coordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do. It is one of the sites of [[Amazon Web Services]], and is owned by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="mturk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=overview|accessdate=14 April 2017|title=Amazon Mechanical Turk, FAQ page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers are able to post jobs known as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), such as choosing the best among several photographs of a storefront, writing product descriptions, or identifying performers on music CDs. Workers, colloquially known as ''Turkers'', can then browse among existing jobs and complete them in exchange for a monetary payment set by the employer. To place jobs, the requesting programs use an open [[application programming interface]] (API), or the more limited MTurk Requester site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://requester.mturk.com |title=Overview &amp;#124; Requester &amp;#124; Amazon Mechanical Turk |publisher=Requester.mturk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; To submit a request for tasks to be completed through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, a requester must provide a billing address in one of around 30 approved countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://requester.mturk.com/help/faq#can_requesters_outside_us_use_mturk|title=FAQs – Help – Requester – Amazon Mechanical Turk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The name ''Mechanical Turk'' was inspired by "[[The Turk]]", an 18th-century chess-playing [[automaton]] made by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]] that toured Europe, beating both [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. It was later revealed that this "machine" was not an automaton at all, but was in fact a human [[chess master]] hidden in the cabinet beneath the board and controlling the movements of a humanoid dummy. Likewise, the Mechanical Turk online service allows humans to help the machines of today perform tasks for which they are not suited.

Workers set their own hours and are not under any obligation to accept any particular task. Because workers are paid as [[Independent contractor|contractors]] rather than employees, they don't have to file forms or pay payroll taxes, and they avoid laws stipulating conditions regarding [[minimum wage]], [[overtime]], and [[workers compensation]]. However, they must report their income as self-employment income. The average wage for the multiple microtasks assigned, if performed quickly, is about one dollar an hour, with each task averaging a few cents.&lt;ref name="utne"&gt;[http://www.utne.com/science-technology/amazon-mechanical-turk-zm0z13jfzlin.aspx "Amazon Mechanical Turk: The Digital Sweatshop"] Ellen Cushing ''[[Utne Reader]]'' January–February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Requesters can ask that Workers fulfill qualifications before engaging in a task, and they can set up a test in order to verify the qualification. They can also accept or reject the result sent by the Worker, which affects the Worker's reputation. Workers can have a postal address anywhere in the world. Payment for completing tasks can be redeemed on Amazon.com via [[gift certificate]] (gift certificates are the only payment option available to international workers, apart from India) or be later transferred to a Worker's U.S. bank account. Requesters pay Amazon a 20% commission on the price of successfully completed jobs.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aws.amazon.com/mturk/pricing/|title = Mturk pricing|date = 2014|accessdate = 21 July 2014|website = AWS|publisher = Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location of Turkers ===

According to a survey conducted in 2008 through one MTurk HIT, Workers are primarily located in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/03/mechanical-turk-demographics.html |title=Mechanical Turk: The Demographics|author=[[Panos Ipeirotis]]|date=March 19, 2008|publisher=New York University|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; with demographics generally similar to the overall Internet population in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2009/03/turker-demographics-vs-internet.html|title=Turker Demographics vs Internet Demographics|author=Panos Ipeirotis|date=March 16, 2009|publisher=New York University|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same author carried out a second survey in 2010 (after the introduction of cash payments for Indian workers), which gave new and updated results on the demographics of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2010/03/new-demographics-of-mechanical-turk.html|title=The New Demographics of Mechanical Turk|author=Panos Ipeirotis|date=March 9, 2010|publisher=[[New York University]]|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently runs a website showing worker demographics that is updated hourly. It shows that approximately 80% of workers are located in the United States and 20% are located elsewhere in the world, most of whom are in India.&lt;ref name="MTurk-tracker"&gt;{{cite web|title=MTurk Tracker|url=http://demographics.mturk-tracker.com/|website=demographics.mturk-tracker.com|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study reports Worker demographics on over 30,000 Workers across 75 studies that have been conducted since 2013.&lt;ref name="blog.turkprime.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The New New Demographics on Mechanical Turk: Is there Still a Gender Gap?|url=http://blog.turkprime.com/2015/03/the-new-new-demographics-on-mechanical.html|website=TurkPrime.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The service was initially conceived by [[Venky Harinarayan]].&lt;ref name="uspto"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,197,459.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,197,459&amp;RS=PN/7,197,459/|title = Hybrid machine/human computing arrangement|date = 2001|accessdate = 28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTurk was launched publicly on November 2, 2005. Following its launch, the Mechanical Turk user base grew quickly. In early- to mid-November 2005, there were tens of thousands of jobs, all of them uploaded to the system by Amazon itself for some of its internal tasks that required human intelligence. HIT types have expanded to include transcribing, rating, image tagging, surveys, and writing.

In March 2007, there were reportedly more than 100,000 workers in over 100 countries.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; This increased to over 500,000 registered workers from over 190 countries in January 2011.&lt;ref name=awsdevforum&gt;{{cite web|title=AWS Developer Forums|url=https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=58891|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Techlist published an interactive map pinpointing the locations of 50,000 of their MTurk workers around the world.&lt;ref name=turkermap&gt;{{cite web|last=Tamir|first=Dahn|title=50000 Worldwide Mechanical Turk Workers|url=http://techlist.com/mturk/global-mturk-worker-map.php|publisher=techlist|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Users ===
A user of Mechanical Turks can be either a "Worker" (contractor) or a "Requester" (employer).

Employees have access to a dashboard that displays three sections: total earnings, HIT status and HIT totals.
* Total earnings: displays the total earnings a worker has received from the realization of human intelligence tasks, the gains made from bonuses and the sum of these two.
* HIT status: displays a list of daily activities and the daily income, along with the number of visits that were submitted, approved, rejected or waiting for the given day.
* HIT totals: displays information about HIT which have been accepted or are in process (including the percentage of successes that occurred, returned or abandoned and the percentage of jobs that were approved, rejected or pending those presented).

Employers (companies or independent developers that need jobs performed) can use the Amazon Mechanical Turk API to programmatically integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems. When employers set up their job, they must specify
* how much are they paying for each HIT accomplished,
* how many workers they want to work on each HIT,
* maximum time a worker has to work on a single task,
* how much time the workers have to complete the work,
as well as the specific details about the job they want to be completed.

=== Other aspects ===
;Crowd labor
Amazon Mechanical Turk provides access to a crowd-sourced market of workers that can help to complete work on an as-needed basis. For work that does not require significant task-specific training, this can contrast with the traditional costs of hiring and management of temporary staff. For users, it also allows them to select among a variety of different tasks.

;Quality management
Amazon Mechanical Turk allows more than one user to send a response to the same HIT. When a specific number of users give the same answer, the HIT is automatically approved. All data for HITs is available for viewing as soon as it is submitted, allowing Requesters to manually assess quality. Requesters are not required to accept a worker's results if they are deemed inadequate, which may lead to frustration between parties. If the result is not adequate, the job is rejected and the Requester is not required to pay.

;Price determination
Users are free to work on tasks that they find most interesting, those they like to complete or the best paid. Requesters are allowed to define the payments based on the desired balance of performance and cost-efficiency. Payments are made in cooperation with Amazon Payments.

;User qualification
Amazon Mechanical Turk allows for qualifying users before they work in their tasks using rapid tests. The qualifications can be a series of questions, performing tasks or request users to have historically responded to a minimum percentage of their HIT sent correctly. Such preliminary tests can be used by companies to get data for questions without paying anything.

;Data for Machine Learning
[[Supervised Machine Learning]] algorithms require large amounts of human-annotated data to be trained successfully. Researchers performed such annotation  by hiring students, resulting in high turn-over because of the extreme repetitiveness and tedium of such tasks. By dividing the annotation task across a large number of workers, Mturk offers a means to acquire it cost-effectively, while minimizing tedium by keeping individual workers' tasks suitably small.

=== Applications ===

==== Missing persons searches ====
Since 2007, the service has been used to search for prominent missing individuals. It was first suggested during the search for [[James Kim]], but his body was found before any technical progress was made. That summer, computer scientist [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] disappeared on his yacht and Amazon's [[Werner Vogels]], a personal friend, made arrangements for [[DigitalGlobe]], which provides satellite data for [[Google Maps]] and [[Google Earth]], to put recent photography of the [[Farallon Islands]] on Mechanical Turk. A front-page story on [[Digg]] attracted 12,000 searchers who worked with imaging professionals on the same data. The search was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-08/ff_jimgray?currentPage=5|title=Inside the High-Tech Search for a Silicon Valley Legend|author=Steve Silberman|date=July 24, 2007|publisher=Wired magazine|accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, a similar arrangement was repeated in the [[Steve Fossett search|search for aviator Steve Fossett]]. Satellite data was divided into 85 squared meter sections, and Mechanical Turk users were asked to flag images with "foreign objects" that might be a crash site or other evidence that should be examined more closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/SteveFossettSearch_AmazonMechanicalTurk_PleaseHelp_196097-1.html |title=AVweb Invites You to Join the Search for Steve Fossett |publisher=Avweb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This search was also unsuccessful. The satellite imagery was mostly within a 50-mile radius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/fossett/index.html|title=Official Mechanical Turk Steve Fossett Results|publisher=Amazon.com|date=2007-09-24|accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the crash site was eventually found by hikers about a year later, 65 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSTRE4907G820081001|title=Hikers find Steve Fossett's ID, belongings|author=Jim Christie|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-11-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220030716/https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSTRE4907G820081001| archivedate= 20 December 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social science experiments ====
Beginning in 2010, numerous researchers have explored the viability of Mechanical Turk to recruit subjects of social science experiments. Thousands of papers that rely on data collected from Mechanical Turk workers are published each year, including hundreds in top ranked academic journals.&lt;ref name="mt-cs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandler | first1 = Jesse. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Danielle | year = 2016 | title = Conducting Clinical Research Using Crowdsourced Convenience Samples | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 12 | pages = 53–81 | url = https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/our-publications-and-findings/publications/conducting-clinical-research-using-crowdsourced-convenience-samples | doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-021815-093623| pmid = 26772208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers generally found that while samples of respondents obtained through Mechanical Turk do not perfectly match all relevant characteristics of the U.S. population, they're not wildly misrepresentative either.&lt;ref name="mt-cc"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casey | first1 = Logan | last2 = Chandler | first2 = Jesse | last3 = Levine | first3 = Adam | last4 = Proctor | first4 = Andrew| last5 = Sytolovich| first5 = Dara| year = 2017 | title = Intertemporal Differences Among MTurk Workers: Time-Based Sample Variations and Implications for Online Data Collection | journal = SAGE Open | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 215824401771277 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017712774| doi = 10.1177/2158244017712774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-lf"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levay | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Freese | first2 = Jeremy | last3 = Druckman | first3 = James| year = 2016 | title = The Demographic and Political Composition of Mechanical Turk Samples | journal = SAGE Open | volume = 6| pages = 215824401663643 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2158244016636433| doi = 10.1177/2158244016636433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus among researchers is that the service works best for recruiting a diverse sample; it is less successful with studies that require more precisely defined populations or that require a representative sample of the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="mt-cs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-jr"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/online-labor-markets-research-amazon-mechanical-turk/ | title=Evaluating Online Labor Markets for Experimental Research: Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved June 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-pa"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paolacci | first1 = Gabriele. | last2 = Chandler | first2 = Jesse | last3 = Ipeirotis | first3 = Panos | year = 2010 | title = Running Experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | url = http://www.sjdm.org/~baron/journal/10/10630a/jdm10630a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-pb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhrmester | first1 = Michael | last2 = Kwang | first2 = Tracy | last3 = Gosling | first3 = Sam | year = 2011 | title = Amazon's Mechanical Turk A New Source of Inexpensive, Yet High-Quality, Data? | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/6/1/3.short | doi = 10.1177/1745691610393980| pmid = 26162106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-pc"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berinsky | first1 = Adam J. | last2 = Huber | first2 = Gregory A. | last3 = Lenz | first3 = Gabriel S. | year = 2012 | title = Evaluating Online Labor Markets for Experimental Research: Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 351 | url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/03/02/pan.mpr057.abstract | doi = 10.1093/pan/mpr057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mt-pd"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = John J. | last2 = Rand | first2 = David G. | last3 = Zeckhauser | first3 = Richard J. | year = 2010 | title = The Online Laboratory: Conducting Experiments in a Real Labor Market | journal = Experimental Economics | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 399 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10683-011-9273-9#page-1| doi = 10.1007/s10683-011-9273-9| arxiv = 1004.2931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, the U.S. MTurk population is mostly female and white, and is somewhat younger and more educated than the U.S. population overall. Data collected on jobs conducted since 2013 show that the U.S. population is no longer predominantly female, and that Workers are currently slightly more likely to be male.&lt;ref name="blog.turkprime.com" /&gt; The cost of MTurk was considerably lower than other means of conducting surveys, with workers willing to complete tasks for less than half the U.S. minimum wage.&lt;ref name="mt-jh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = John | last2 = Chilton | first2 = Lydia | year = 2010 | title = The Labor Economics of Paid Crowdsourcing | journal = Proceedings of the 11th ACM conference on Electronic commerce | pages = 209 | arxiv = 1001.0627| doi = 10.1145/1807342.1807376| isbn = 978-1-60558-822-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Artistic and educational research ====
In addition to receiving growing interest from the social sciences, MTurk has also been used as a tool for both artistic and educational exploration. Artist [[Aaron Koblin]] has made use of MTurk's [[crowdsourcing]] ability to create a number of collaborative artistic works such as ''The Sheep Market'' and ''Ten Thousand Cents''&lt;ref&gt;Ten Thousand Cents – Project: http://www.tenthousandcents.com/top.html&lt;/ref&gt; which combined thousands of individual drawings of a US$100 bill.&lt;ref&gt;Koblin, Aaron: {{cite web |url=http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116144056/http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work functions as a sort of reverse [[exquisite corpse]] drawing.

Inspired by Koblin's collaborative artworks, a [[Concordia University]] graduate research student turned to MTurk to see if the crowdsourcing technology could also be used for educational research. Scott McMaster conducted two pilot projects which used HITs to request drawings, but, in contrast to Koblin's work, the workers knew exactly what the drawings were being used for. The jobs required participants to visually represent sets of words in drawings and fill out a short demographic survey. Although the research was in its infancy, McMaster's findings suggested that a [[Globalization|globalizing]] effect is emerging within visual cultural representations. It is a published instance of this type of online research into [[visual culture]].&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, S. (2012). New Approaches to Image-based Research and Visual Literacy. In Avgerinou, Chandler, Search and Terzic (Eds.), New Horizons in Visual Literacy: Selected Readings of the International Visual Literacy Association (122-132). Siauliai, Lithuania: SMC Scientia Educologica: https://concordia.academia.edu/SCOTTMCMASTER&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party programming ===
Programmers have developed various browser extensions and [[Scripting language|scripts]] designed to simplify the process of completing jobs. According to the Amazon Web Services Blog, however, Amazon appears to disapprove of the ones that completely automate the process and preclude the human element, because of the concern that the task completion process - e.g. answering a survey -  could be gamed with random responses, and the resultant collected data could be worthless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2005/12/amazon_mechanic.html |title=Amazon Web Services Blog: Amazon Mechanical Turk Status Update |publisher=Aws.typepad.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts using so-called automated bots have been banned. There are services that extend the capabilities to MTurk.

==== API ====
Amazon makes available an [[application programming interface]] (API) to give users another access point into the MTurk system. The MTurk API lets a programmer access numerous aspects of MTurk like submit jobs, retrieve completed work, and approve or reject that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=28 |title=Documentation Archive : Amazon Web Services |publisher=Developer.amazonwebservices.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410032147/http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=28 |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Amazon launched support for AWS Software Development Kits (SDK), allowing for nine new SDKs available to MTurk Users. MTurk is accessible via API from the following languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, PHP or C++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/Welcome.html | title=Amazon Mechanical Turk API Reference |publisher=Developer.amazonwebservices.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Web sites and web services can use the API to integrate MTurk work into other web applications, providing users with alternatives to the interface Amazon has built for these functions.

=== Use case examples ===

==== Processing photos / videos ====
Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a platform for processing images, a task well-suited to human intelligence. Requesters have created tasks asking workers to label objects found in an image, select the most relevant picture in a group of pictures, screen inappropriate content, and classify objects in satellite images. Also, crowd workers have completed tasks of digitizing text from images such as scanned forms filled out by hand.&lt;ref name="tr-hr"&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/inside-amazons-clickworker-platform-how-half-a-million-people-are-training-ai-for-pennies-per-task "Inside Amazon's clickworker platform: How half a million people are being paid pennies to train AI" ''Tech Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data cleaning / verification ====
Companies with large online catalogs use Mechanical Turk to identify duplicates and verify details of item entries. Some examples of fixing duplicates are identifying and removing duplicates in yellow pages directory listings and online product catalog entries. Examples of verifying details include checking restaurant details (e.g. phone number and hours) and finding contact information from web pages (e.g. author name and email).&lt;ref name="utne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tr-hr" /&gt;

==== Information collection ====
Diversification and scale of personnel of Mechanical Turk allow collecting an amount of information that would be difficult outside of a crowd platform. Mechanical Turk allows requesters to amass a large number of responses to various types of surveys, from basic demographics to academic research. Other uses include writing comments, descriptions and blog entries to websites and searching data elements or specific fields in large government and legal documents.&lt;ref name="tr-hr" /&gt;

==== Data processing ====
Companies use Mechanical Turk's crowd labor to understand and respond to different types of data. Common uses include editing and transcription of podcasts, translation, and matching search engine results.&lt;ref name="utne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tr-hr" /&gt;

== Research validity ==
The validity of research conducted with the Mechanical Turk worker pool has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running Experiments with Amazon Mechanical Turk|url=http://mgto.org/running-experiments-with-amazon-mechanical-turk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can I Use Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for a Research Study?|url=http://neoacademic.com/2014/11/13/can-use-mechanical-turk-mturk-research-study/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in large part due to the proprietary method that Mechanical Turk uses to select its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.trustpilot.com|url=https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/58c5b860a912c407fce890bb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the method of selection is not shared with researchers, researchers can not know the true demographics of the pool of participants. It is unclear if Mechanical Turk uses fiscal, political, or educational limiters in their selection process. This may invalidate any surveys or research done using the Mechanical Turk worker pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Validity|url=https://explorable.com/external-validity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Validity|url=https://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/external.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor issues ==

=== Monetary compensation ===
Because tasks are typically simple and repetitive and users are paid often only a few cents to complete them, some have criticized Mechanical Turk for exploiting and not compensating workers for the true value of the task they complete.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/CGC.2013.89|title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly: Why Crowdsourcing Needs Ethics|pages=531|year=2013|last1=Schmidt|first1=Florian Alexander|isbn=978-0-7695-5114-2|journal= Cloud and Green Computing (CGC), 2013 Third International Conference on}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum payment that Amazon allows for a task is one cent. The market for tasks is competitive and for some these tasks are their only available form of employment, particularly for the less educated. Because of the need to provide for themselves and a lack of other opportunities, many workers accept the low compensation for the completion of tasks. A study of 3.8 million tasks completed by 2,767 workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk showed that “workers earned a median hourly wage of about $2 an hour” with 4 percent of workers earning more than $7.25 per hour. Since these workers are considered independent contractors, they are not protected by the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|Fair Labor Standards Act]] that guarantees minimum wage. As workers search for tasks, they do not receive compensation nor do they receive additional compensation if a task takes longer than estimated by the requester.&lt;ref name="Semuels"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/|title=The Internet is Enabling a New Kind of Poorly Paid Hell|last=Semuels|first=Alana|date=January 23, 2018|website=The Atlantic|access-date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer scientist [[Jaron Lanier]] notes how the [[Web design|design]] of Mechanical Turk "allows you to think of the people as software components" that conjures "a sense of magic, as if you can just pluck results out of the cloud at an incredibly low cost."&lt;ref name="Lanier2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaron Lanier|title=[[Who Owns the Future?]] |year=2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-5497-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in one psychological study done by the University of Texas, evidence showed that many of the workers did not complete the task for monetary compensation, and instead did the work for enjoyment and self-fulfillment.&lt;ref name="mt-pb" /&gt; '

=== Fraud ===
''The Nation'' magazine said in 2014 that some requesters had taken advantage of workers by having them do the tasks, then rejecting their submissions in order to avoid paying them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/178241/how-crowdworkers-became-ghosts-digital-machine?page=0,3 Moshe Z. Marvit, "How Crowdworkers Became the Ghosts in the Digital Machine," ''The Nation,'' February 24, 2014, screen 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]], Mechanical Turk was one of the means of covertly gathering private information for a massive database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/cambridge-analytica-and-the-coming-data-bust.html?|author=New York Times|title=Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system paid persons a dollar or two to install a [[Facebook]] connected app and answer personal questions. The survey task, as a work for hire, was not used for a demographic or psychological research project as it might have seemed. The purpose was instead to bait the worker to reveal personal information about the worker's identity that was not already collected by Facebook or Mechanical Turk.

=== Labor relations ===
Others have criticized that the marketplace does not have the ability for the workers to negotiate with the employers. In response to the growing criticisms of payment evasion and lack of representation, a group has developed a third party platform called Turkopticon which allows workers to give feedback on their employers allowing other users to avoid potentially shady jobs and to recommend superior employers.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729036.200-crowdsourcing-grows-up-as-online-workers-unite.html#.VV9rTE9Viko |title='Crowdsourcing grows up as online workers unite' |author=Hal Hodson |date=February 7, 2013 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/|title=turkopticon's add-on}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another platform called Dynamo was created to allow the workers to collect anonymously and organize campaigns to better their work environment, including the Guidelines for Academic Requesters and the Dear Jeff Bezos Campaign.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/amazon-mechanical-turk-workers-protest-jeff-bezos |title='Amazon's Mechanical Turk workers protest: 'I am a human being, not an algorithm'' |author=Mark Harris |date=December 3, 2014 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/03/amazon-mechanical-turk-workers-ask-for-respect/ |title='Amazon's Mechanical Turk workers want to be treated like humans' |author=Jon Fingas |date=December 3, 2014 |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theverge"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7331777/amazon-mechanical-turk-workforce-digital-labor |title='Amazon's Mechanical Turkers want to be recognized as 'actual human beings'' |author=James Vincent |date=December 4, 2014 |publisher=The Verge |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/3042081/what-does-a-union-look-like-in-the-gig-economy |title='WHAT DOES A UNION LOOK LIKE IN THE GIG ECONOMY?' |author=Sarah Kessler |date=February 19, 2015 |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon has made it harder for workers to enroll in Dynamo by closing the request account that provided workers with a required code for Dynamo membership. Amazon has installed updates that prevent plugins that identify high quality human intelligence tasks from functioning on the website.&lt;ref name="Semuels"/&gt;

{{further|Crowdsourcing}}
Amazon coined the term ''artificial artificial intelligence'' for processes outsourcing some parts of a computer program to humans, for those tasks carried out much faster by humans than computers. [[Jeff Bezos]] was responsible for the concept that led to Amazon's Mechanical Turk being developed to realize this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7001738?story_id=7001738|title=Artificial artificial intelligence|publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=2006-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTurk is comparable in some respects to the now discontinued [[Google Answers]] service. However, the Mechanical Turk is a more general [[Marketplace#Internet Markets|marketplace]] that can potentially help distribute any kind of work tasks all over the world. The [[Collaborative human interpreter|Collaborative Human Interpreter]] (CHI) by Philipp Lenssen also suggested using distributed human intelligence to help computer programs perform tasks that computers cannot do well. MTurk could be used as the execution engine for the CHI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5270">In [[neuroethology]] and the study of [[learning]], '''anti-Hebbian learning''' describes a particular class of [[learning rule]] by which [[synaptic plasticity]] can be controlled. These rules are based on a reversal of [[Hebbian learning|Hebb's postulate]], and therefore can be simplistically understood as dictating reduction of the strength of synaptic connectivity between neurons following a scenario in which a neuron directly contributes to production of an action potential in another neuron.
 	
==Evidence from neuroethology==
Neuroethological study has provided strong evidence for the existence of a system which adheres to an anti-[[Hebbian learning]] rule. Research on the mormyrid electric fish has demonstrated that the [[electrosensory lateral-line lobe]] (ELL) receives sensory input from [[knollenorgan]]s (electroreceptive sensory organs) which utilize a self-generated electrical discharge (called an EOD; electric organ discharge) to extract information from the environment about objects in close proximity to the fish.

In addition to information from sensory receptors, the ELL receives a signal from the area of the brain responsible for ''initiating'' the electrical discharges, known as the EOD command nucleus. This [[efference copy]] diverges, transmitted through two separate pathways, before the signals converge along with electrosensory input on [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje]]-like Medium Ganglion cells in the ELL. These cells receive information through extensive apical dendritic projections from parallel fibers that signal the transmission of an order to release an EOD. These cells also receive information from neurons conveying electrosensory information.

Important to anti-Hebbian learning, the synapses between the parallel fibers and the apical dendrites of Medium [[Ganglion cells]] show a specific pattern of synaptic plasticity. Should activation of the dendrites by parallel fibers occur in a short time period preceding the initiation of a dendritic broad spike (an action potential which travels through the dendrites), the strength of the connection between the neurons at these synapses will be reduced. Activation by the parallel fibers in all other circumstances – including activation significantly preceding as well as any activation following the broad spike – will result in the strengthening of the [[synapse]].

==Significance==
Since the neurons of the ELL receive both a corollary discharge (another term for an efference copy) of the motor output commands sent to the EOD, and afferent input from the electrosensory receptors, the animal is able to eliminate predictable inputs produced by its own motor output. The system is able to filter the expected input from the EOD, while signals which are unexpected, arriving at odd intervals with regard to the motor command are effectively strengthened by the learning rule. This allows the extraction of information about objects which cause an alteration in the flow of the electric field around the fish, highlighting changes while discarding uninformative sensory inputs.

The adaptation of these synapses, though, will only increase the strength of a synaptic connection until the resulting excitation aids in activation of a broad-spike wave. As a result, if changes in external environment are consistent, the connections between the neurons previously described will reach a level at which excitation, similar to the initial state, is once again held at a threshold, so that slight changes in the incoming sensory information will result in contribution to broad-spike initiation. In this manner, the organism is able to learn to ignore redundant sensory information in the environment. The eventual desensitization to these consistencies is essential to prevent excessive noise from masking important sensory information. Numerous potential causes which could result in a consistent alteration in the reception of EOD signals include: growth, changes in water conductance (salinity), low water levels (where the shallow bottom of the body of water would interfere with electrical currents), and possibly injuries.

==Predicted application==
Synaptic plasticity operating under the control of an anti-Hebbian learning rule is thought to occur in the [[cerebellum]]. Understanding the operation of neural learning could provide valuable insights for the treatment of cerebellar-related disorders. The knowledge could also serve a significant function in the computer-based collection of data, repeatedly adjusting to redundant inputs while emphasizing the appearance of alterations.

== History ==
In 1962 [[Douglas C. Engelbart]] released the report "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|title = Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|date = October 1962|accessdate = 2015-04-20|website = SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223 • Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Washington DC, Contract AF 49(638)-1024 • SRI Project No. 3578 (AUGMENT,3906,).|publisher = [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|last = Engelbart|first = Douglas C|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|archive-date = 2011-05-04|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced, and laid the groundwork for, augmented cognition. In this paper, Engelbart defines "augmenting human intellect"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as "increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Modern augmented cognition began to emerge in the early 2000s. Advances in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological sciences during the 1990s set the stage for the emerging field of augmented cognition – this period has been termed the "[[Decade of the Brain]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major advancements in [[functional magnetic resonance imaging |functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] and [[electroencephalography|electroencephalography (EEG)]] have been pivotal in the emergence of augmented cognition technologies which seek to monitor the user's cognitive abilities. As these tools were primarily used in controlled environments, their further development was essential to pragmatic augmented cognition applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== DARPA's Augmented Cognition Program ===
The [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] has been one of the primary funding agencies for augmented cognition investigators. A major focus of DARPA's augmented cognition program (AugCog) has been developing more robust tools for monitoring cognitive state and integrating them with computer systems. The program envisions "order of magnitude increases in available, net thinking power resulting from linked human-machine dyads [that] will provide such clear informational superiority that few rational individuals or organizations would challenge under the consequences of mortality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|date = June 1, 2004|access-date = 2015-04-19|issn = 1044-7318|pages = 127–130|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|first = Dylan|last = Schmorrow|first2 = Dennis|last2 = McBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = M. L. | year = 2010 | title = VIEWS | url = | journal = Ergonomics In Design | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program began in 2001, and has since be renamed to Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (US) Committee on Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2009. Appendix D, Research on Managing Information Overload in Soldiers Under Stress. Available from:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207983/&lt;/ref&gt; By leveraging such tools, the program seeks to provide warfighters with enhanced cognitive abilities, especially under complex or stressful war conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2002, the program vision is divided into four phases:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Phase 1: Real-time cognitive state detection
* Phase 2: Real-time cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 3: Autonomous cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 4: Operation demonstration and transition
Proof of concept was carried out in two phases: near real time monitoring of the user's cognitive activity, and subsequent manipulation of the user's cognitive state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society ===
The Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society held its first conference in July 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the society's first conference, attendees from a diverse background including academia, government, and industry came together to create an agenda for future research. The agenda focused on near-, medium-, and long-term research and development goals in key augmented cognition science and technology areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, where the society first established itself, continues to host the society's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://2014.hci.international/vamr|title = Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 April 2015|website = HCI International|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translation engines ===
Thad Starner, and the [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] Research Group at Georgia Tech, have been researching systems for the recognition of ASL. Telesign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://research.cc.gatech.edu/ccg/?q=projects/telesign|title = Telesign|date = 2015-04-19|accessdate = 2015-04-19|website = Telesign|publisher = Georgia Tech Contextual Computing Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-way translation system from ASL to [[English language|English]], was shown to have a 94% accuracy rate on a vocabulary with 141 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1853/28993|title = Towards a One-Way American Sign Language Translator|last = |first = |date = May 2004|journal = Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2004.

== Controversy ==

=== Privacy concerns ===
The increasing sophistication of brain-reading technologies has led many to investigate their potential applications for lie detection. Legally required brain scans arguably violate “the guarantee against self-incrimination” because they differ from acceptable forms of bodily evidence, such as fingerprints or blood samples, in an important way: they are not simply physical, hard evidence, but evidence that is intimately linked to the defendant's mind. Under US law, brain-scanning technologies might also raise implications for the Fourth Amendment, calling into question whether they constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroscience, Ethics, and National Security: The State of the Art|last = Tennison|first = Michael|date = March 2012|journal = PLOS Biology |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001289|pmid = 22448146|last2 = Moreno|first2 = Jonathon |pmc=3308927|volume=10|pages=e1001289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human augmentation ===
Many of the same arguments in the debate around [[human enhancement]] can be analogized to augmented cognition. Economic inequality, for instance, may serve to exacerbate societal advantages and disadvantages due to the limited availability of such technologies.

Fearing the potential applications of devices like Google Glass, certain gambling establishments (such as Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas) banned its use even before it was commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|title = Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|date = May 8, 2013|accessdate = |website = IGN|publisher = |last = Clark|first = Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">'''Chromosomal landing''' is a genetic technique used to identify and isolate clones in a genetic library. Chromosomal landing reduces the problem of analyzing large, and/or highly repetitive genomes by minimizing the need for chromosome walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanksley|first1=Steven D.|last2=Ganal|first2=Martin W.|last3=Martin|first3=Gregory B.|title=Chromosome landing: a paradigm for map-based gene cloning in plants with large genomes|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=February 1995|volume=11|issue=2|pages=63–68|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(00)88999-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 23, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the principle that the expected average between-[[genetic marker|marker]] [[genetic distance|distance]]s can be smaller than the average insert length of a clone library containing the gene of interest. 

From the abstract of {{PMID|7716809}}:
:The strategy of [[chromosome walking]] is based on the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. Recent technological developments invalidate this assumption for many species. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the genomic library being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to [[Genetic screen|screen]] the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for chromosome walking and its associated problems. Chromosome landing, together with the technology that has made it possible, is likely to become the main strategy by which [[map-based cloning]] is applied to isolate both major genes and genes underlying [[quantitative traits]] in [[plant]] species.

In [[computer engineering]], '''computer architecture''' is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of [[computer]] systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clements|first1=Alan|title=Principles of Computer Hardware|page=1|edition=Fourth|quote=Architecture describes the internal organization of a computer in an abstract way; that is, it defines the capabilities of the computer and its programming model. You can have two computers that have been constructed in different ways with different technologies but with the same architecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other definitions computer architecture involves [[instruction set architecture]] design, [[microarchitecture]] design, [[logic design]], and [[implementation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennessy|first1=John|last2=Patterson|first2=David|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|page=11|edition=Fifth|quote=This task has many aspects, including instruction set design, functional organization, logic design,and implementation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]], describing the [[analytical engine]]. When building the computer [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]] in 1936, [[Konrad Zuse]] described in two patent applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data, i.e. the [[Stored-program computer|stored-program]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Electronic Digital Computers |journal=Nature |date=25 September 1948 |volume=162 |page=487 |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |accessdate=2009-04-10 |doi=10.1038/162487a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Faber, "Konrad Zuses Bemuehungen um die Patentanmeldung der Z3", 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Two other early and important examples are:
* [[John von Neumann]]'s 1945 paper, [[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]], which described an organization of logical elements;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC|last=Neumann|first=John|publisher=|year=1945|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*[[Alan M. Turing|Alan Turing]]'s more detailed ''Proposed Electronic Calculator'' for the [[Automatic Computing Engine]], also 1945 and which cited [[John von Neumann]]'s paper.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in B. J. Copeland (Ed.), "Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine", OUP, 2005, pp. 369-454.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “architecture” in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and [[Fred Brooks|Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.]], members of the Machine Organization department in IBM’s main research center in 1959. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication about the [[IBM 7030 Stretch|Stretch]], an IBM-developed [[supercomputer]] for [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory). To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types, hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of “system architecture” – a term that seemed more useful than “machine organization.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/pdfs/05-10/102634114.pdf|last1=Johnson|first1=Lyle|title=A Description of Stretch|page=1|year=1960|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Brooks, a Stretch designer, started Chapter 2 of a book (Planning a Computer System: Project Stretch, ed. W. Buchholz, 1962) by writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning a Computer System|last=Buchholz|first=Werner|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Computer architecture, like other architecture, is the art of determining the needs of the user of a structure and then designing to meet those needs as effectively as possible within economic and technological constraints.}}

Brooks went on to help develop the [[IBM System/360]] (now called the [[IBM zSeries]]) line of computers, in which “architecture” became a noun defining “what the user needs to know”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/system360/|title=System 360, From Computers to Computer Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=IBM100|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, computer users came to use the term in many less-explicit ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellige|first1=Hans Dieter|title=Geschichten der Informatik: Visionen, Paradigmen, Leitmotive|chapter=Die Genese von Wissenschaftskonzeptionen der Computerarchitektur:  Vom "system of organs" zum Schichtmodell des Designraums| pages=411-472|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computer architectures were designed on paper and then directly built into the final hardware form.&lt;ref&gt;ACE underwent seven paper designs in one year, before a prototype was initiated in 1948. [B. J. Copeland (Ed.), "Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine", OUP, 2005, p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, computer architecture prototypes were physically built in the form of a [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) computer—such as the prototypes of the [[Motorola 6800#Development team|6800]] and the [[PA-RISC]]—tested, and tweaked, before committing to the final hardware form.
As of the 1990s, new computer architectures are typically "built", tested, and tweaked—inside some other computer architecture in a [[computer architecture simulator]]; or inside a FPGA as a [[soft microprocessor]]; or both—before committing to the final hardware form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/CDAintro.html|title=Organization of Computer Systems|last=Schmalz|first=|date=|website=UF CISE|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcategories ==
The discipline of computer architecture has three main subcategories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|edition=Third|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Instruction set|Instruction Set Architecture]]'', or ISA.  The ISA defines the [[machine code]] that a [[computer processor|processor]] reads and acts upon as well as the [[word size]], [[addressing mode|memory address modes]], [[processor register]]s, and [[data type]].
# ''[[Microarchitecture]]'', or ''computer organization'' describes how a particular [[Central processing unit|processor]] will implement the ISA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Computer Science, Engineering, and Technology|last=Laplante|first=Phillip A.|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-2691-5|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of a computer's [[CPU cache]] for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA.
# ''[[Systems design|System Design]]'' includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system.  These include:
## Data processing other than the CPU, such as [[direct memory access]] (DMA)
## Other issues such as [[virtualization]], [[multiprocessing]], and [[software]] features.

There are other types of computer architecture. The following types are used in bigger companies like Intel, and count for 1% of all of computer architecture
* Macroarchitecture: [[architectural layer]]s more abstract than microarchitecture
* Assembly Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): A smart assembler may convert an abstract assembly language common to a group of machines into slightly different [[machine language]] for different [[implementation]]s
* Programmer Visible Macroarchitecture: higher level language tools such as [[compiler]]s may define a consistent interface or contract to programmers using them, abstracting differences between underlying ISA, UISA, and [[microarchitecture]]s. E.g. the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] standards define different Programmer Visible Macroarchitecture.
* UISA (Microcode Instruction Set Architecture)—a group of machines with different hardware level microarchitectures may share a common microcode architecture, and hence a UISA.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* Pin Architecture: The hardware functions that a [[microprocessor]] should provide to a hardware platform, e.g., the [[x86]] pins A20M, FERR/IGNNE or FLUSH. Also, messages that the processor should emit so that external [[CPU cache|caches]] can be invalidated (emptied). Pin architecture functions are more flexible than ISA functions because external hardware can adapt to new encodings, or change from a pin to a message. The term "architecture" fits, because the functions must be provided for compatible systems, even if the detailed method changes.

===Definition===
The purpose is to design a computer that maximizes performance while keeping power consumption in check, costs low relative to the amount of expected performance, and is also very reliable.
For this, many aspects are to be considered which includes instruction set design, functional organization, logic design, and implementation.
The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic design, and packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall11/lectures/00_intro.pdf|title=What is computer architecture?|last=Martin|first=Milo|date=|website=UPENN|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction set architecture===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main | Instruction set architecture}}
An instruction set architecture (ISA) is the interface between the computer's software and hardware and also can be viewed as the programmer's view of the machine. Computers do not understand [[high-level programming language]]s such as Java, C++, or most programming languages used. A processor only understands instructions encoded in some numerical fashion, usually as [[Binary numeral system|binary number]]s. Software tools, such as [[compiler]]s, translate those high level languages into instructions that the processor can understand.

Besides instructions, the ISA defines items in the computer that are available to a program&amp;mdash;e.g. [[data type]]s, [[Processor register|registers]], [[addressing mode]]s, and memory.  Instructions locate these available items with register indexes (or names) and memory addressing modes.

The ISA of a computer is usually described in a small instruction manual, which describes how the instructions are encoded. Also, it may define short (vaguely) mnemonic names for the instructions. The names can be recognized by a software development tool called an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]].  An assembler is a computer program that translates a human-readable form of the ISA into a computer-readable form.  [[Disassembler]]s are also widely available, usually in [[debugger]]s and software programs to isolate and correct malfunctions in binary computer programs.

ISAs vary in quality and completeness.  A good ISA compromises between programmer convenience (how easy the code is to understand), size of the code (how much code is required to do a specific action), cost of the computer to interpret the instructions (more complexity means more hardware needed to decode and execute the instructions), and speed of the computer (with more complex decoding hardware comes longer decode time).  Memory organization defines how instructions interact with the memory, and how memory interacts with itself.

During design [[Emulator|emulation]] software (emulators) can run programs written in a proposed instruction set. Modern emulators can measure size, cost, and speed to determine if a particular ISA is meeting its goals.

===Computer organization===
{{main | Microarchitecture}}
Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite detailed analysis of the computer's organization.  For example, in a SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way.

Computer organization also helps plan the selection of a processor for a particular project. Multimedia projects may need very rapid data access, while virtual machines may need fast interrupts. Sometimes certain tasks need additional components as well.  For example, a computer capable of running a virtual machine needs [[virtual memory]] hardware so that the memory of different virtual computers can be kept separated. Computer organization and features also affect power consumption and processor cost.

===Implementation===
{{Main|Implementation}}
Once an instruction set and micro-architecture are designed, a practical machine must be developed. This design process is called the ''implementation''. Implementation is usually not considered architectural design, but rather hardware [[Engineering design process|design engineering]]. Implementation can be further broken down into several steps:
* '''Logic Implementation''' designs the circuits required at a logic gate level
* '''Circuit Implementation''' does [[transistor]]-level designs of basic elements (gates, multiplexers, latches etc.) as well as of some larger blocks ([[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s, caches etc.) that may be implemented at the log gate level, or even at the physical level if the design calls for it.
* '''Physical Implementation''' draws physical circuits.  The different circuit components are placed in a chip [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplan]] or on a board and the wires connecting them are created.
* '''Design Validation''' tests the computer as a whole to see if it works in all situations and all timings.  Once the design validation process starts, the design at the logic level are tested using logic emulators. However, this is usually too slow to run realistic test.  So, after making corrections based on the first test, prototypes are constructed using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays ([[FPGA]]s). Most hobby projects stop at this stage.  The final step is to test prototype integrated circuits.  Integrated circuits may require several redesigns to fix problems.

For [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, the entire implementation process is organized differently and is often referred to as [[CPU design]].

==Design goals==
The exact form of a computer system depends on the constraints and goals. Computer architectures usually trade off standards, power versus performance, cost, memory capacity, [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (latency is the amount of time that it takes for information from one node to travel to the source) and throughput. Sometimes other considerations, such as features, size, weight, reliability, and expandability are also factors.

The most common scheme does an in depth power analysis and figures out how to keep power consumption low, while maintaining adequate performance.

===Performance===
Modern computer performance is often described in IPC (instructions per [[Clock rate|cycle]]).  This measures the efficiency of the architecture at any clock frequency.  Since a faster rate can make a faster computer, this is a useful measurement. Older computers had IPC counts as low as 0.1 [[instructions per cycle]].  Simple modern processors easily reach near 1.  [[Superscalar]] processors may reach three to five IPC by executing several instructions per clock cycle.

Counting machine language instructions would be misleading because they can do varying amounts of work in different ISAs. The "instruction" in the standard measurements is not a count of the ISA's actual machine language instructions, but a unit of measurement, usually based on the speed of the [[VAX]] computer architecture.

Many people used to measure a computer's speed by the clock rate (usually in MHz or GHz). This refers to the cycles per second of the main clock of the CPU. However, this metric is somewhat misleading, as a machine with a higher clock rate may not necessarily have greater performance. As a result, manufacturers have moved away from clock speed as a measure of performance.

Other factors influence speed, such as the mix of [[functional unit]]s, [[computer bus|bus]] speeds, available memory, and the type and order of instructions in the programs.

There are two main types of speed: latency and throughput. Latency is the time between the start of a process and its completion. Throughput is the amount of work done per unit time.  [[Interrupt latency]] is the guaranteed maximum response time of the system to an electronic event (like when the disk drive finishes moving some data).

Performance is affected by a very wide range of design choices — for example, [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] a processor usually makes latency worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a [[real-time computing|real-time]] environment and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a predictable, short time after the brake pedal is sensed or else failure of the brake will occur.

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]ing takes all these factors into account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it shouldn't be how you choose a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but don't offer similar advantages to general tasks.

===Power efficiency===
{{Main|Low-power electronics}}
Power efficiency is another important measurement in modern computers. A higher power efficiency can often be traded for lower speed or higher cost. The typical measurement when referring to power consumption in computer architecture is MIPS/W (millions of instructions per second per watt).

Modern circuits have less power required per transistor as the number of transistors per chip grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eacharya.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/53e0c6cbe413016f23443704_INFIEP_33/192/ET/33-192-ET-V1-S1__ssed_unit_4_module_10_integrated_circuits_and_fabrication_e-text.pdf|title=Integrated circuits and fabrication|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because each transistor that is put in a new chip requires its own power supply and requires new pathways to be built to power it. However the number of transistors per chip is starting to increase at a slower rate. Therefore, power efficiency is starting to become as important, if not more important than fitting more and more transistors into a single chip. Recent processor designs have shown this emphasis as they put more focus on power efficiency rather than cramming as many transistors into a single chip as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/w/solution/mod_ap/8895/?CID=AFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170|title=Exynos 9 Series (8895)|last=|first=|date=|website=Samsung|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of embedded computers, power efficiency has long been an important goal next to throughput and latency.

===Shifts in market demand===
Increases in publicly released refresh rates have grown slowly over the past few years, with respect to vast leaps in power consumption reduction and miniaturization demand. This has led to a new demand for longer battery life and reductions in size due to the mobile technology being produced at a greater rate. This change in focus from greater refresh rates to power consumption and miniaturization can be shown by the significant reductions in power consumption, as much as 50%, that were  reported by Intel in their release of the [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell microarchitecture]]; where they dropped their power consumption benchmark from 30-40 watts down to 10-20 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/white-paper/resources-xeon-measuring-processor-power-paper.pdf|title=Measuring Processor Power TDP vs ACP|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=Intel|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the processing speed increase of 3&amp;nbsp;GHz to 4&amp;nbsp;GHz (2002 to 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2012/3827-spring/advanced-arch-2011.pdf|title=History of Processor Performance|last=|first=|date=24 April 2012|website=cs.columbia.edu|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be seen that the focus in research and development are shifting away from refresh rates and moving towards consuming less power and taking up less space.

'''Continuous optimization''' is a branch of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] in [[applied mathematics]].

As opposed to [[discrete optimization]], the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] used in the [[objective function]] are required to be [[continuous variable]]s&amp;mdash;that is, to be chosen from a set of [[real number|real]] values between which there are no gaps (values from [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s of the [[real line]]). Because of this [[continuity (mathematics)|continuity]] assumption, continuous optimization allows the use of [[calculus]] techniques.

'''The discrete dipole approximation''' (DDA) is a method for computing [[scattering]] of radiation by particles of arbitrary shape and by periodic structures. Given a target of arbitrary geometry, one seeks to calculate its scattering and absorption properties. Exact solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]] are known only for special geometries such as spheres, spheroids, or cylinders, so approximate methods are in general required. However, the DDA employs no physical approximations and can produce accurate enough results, given sufficient computer power.

==Basic concepts==
The basic idea of the DDA was introduced in 1964 by DeVoe
&lt;ref&gt;H. DeVoe,  Optical properties of molecular aggregates. I. Classical model of electronic absorption and refraction, J. Chem. Phys. 41, 393-400 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;
who applied it to study the optical properties of molecular aggregates; retardation effects were not included, so DeVoe's treatment was limited to aggregates that were small compared with the wavelength. The DDA, including retardation effects, was proposed in 1973 by  [[Edward Mills Purcell|Purcell]] and Pennypacker
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|author1=E. M. Purcell |author2=C. R. Pennypacker |title=Scattering and absorption of light by nonspherical dielectric grains
|journal=Astrophysical Journal
|volume=186 |pages=705 | doi = 10.1086/152538
|year=1973|bibcode = 1973ApJ...186..705P }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
who used it to study interstellar dust grains. Simply stated, the DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire dipole moments in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled dipole approximation.
&lt;ref&gt;S. B. Singham and G. C. Salzman, Evaluation of the scattering matrix of an arbitrary particle using the coupled dipole approximation, J. Chem. Phys. 84, 2658-2667(1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;S. B. Singham and C. F. Bohren, Light scattering by an arbitrary particle: a physical reformulation of the coupled dipoles method, Opt. Lett. 12, 10-12 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature provides the physical inspiration for the DDA: in 1909 [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]
&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Lorentz, Theory of Electrons (Teubner, Leipzig, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt;
showed that the dielectric properties of a substance could be directly related to the polarizabilities of the individual atoms of which it was composed, with a particularly simple and exact relationship, the [[Clausius-Mossotti relation]] (or Lorentz-Lorenz), when the atoms are located on a cubic lattice. We may expect that, just as a continuum representation of a solid is appropriate on length scales that are large compared with the interatomic spacing, an array of polarizable points can accurately approximate the response of a continuum target on length scales that are large compared with the interdipole separation.

For a finite array of point dipoles the scattering problem may be solved exactly, so the only approximation that is present in the DDA is the replacement of the continuum target by an array of N-point dipoles. The replacement requires specification of both the geometry (location of the dipoles) and the dipole polarizabilities. For monochromatic incident waves the self-consistent solution for the oscillating dipole moments may be found; from these  the absorption and scattering cross sections are computed. If DDA solutions are obtained for two independent polarizations of the incident wave, then the complete amplitude scattering matrix can be determined.

Alternatively, the DDA can be derived from [[Electric-field integral equation|volume integral equation for the electric field]].&lt;ref name=Yurkin2007a&gt;{{cite journal |title=The discrete dipole approximation: an overview and recent developments |author1=M. A. Yurkin |author2=A. G. Hoekstra |arxiv=0704.0038 |journal= Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.01.034 |pages=558–589 |volume=106|bibcode = 2007JQSRT.106..558Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights that the approximation of point dipoles is equivalent to that of discretizing the integral equation, and thus decreases with decreasing dipole size.

With the recognition that the polarizabilities may be tensors, the DDA can readily be applied to anisotropic materials. The extension of the DDA to treat materials with nonzero magnetic susceptibility is also straightforward, although for most applications magnetic effects are negligible.

==Extensions==
The method was improved by [[Bruce T. Draine|Draine]], [[Piotr J. Flatau|Flatau]], and [[Jeremy Goodman|Goodman]] who applied [[Fast Fourier Transform]] and [[conjugate gradient method]] to calculate [[convolution]] problem arising in the DDA methodology which allowed to calculate scattering by large targets. They distributed discrete dipole approximation open source code DDSCAT.&lt;ref name=draine1994&gt;

'''Disk Detective''' is the first [[NASA]] led and funded collaboration project with [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects&lt;/ref&gt; It is NASA’s largest [[crowdsourcing]] [[citizen science]] project &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-032 NASA-Sponsored 'Disk Detective' Lets Public Search for New Planetary Nurseries&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at engaging the general public in search of stars, which are surrounded by dust-rich [[circumstellar disks]], where planets usually dwell and are formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scilogs.com/marketing_for_scientists/launching-disk-detective-a-new-citizen-science-website/ Launching Disk Detective: A New Citizen Science Website › Marketing For Scientists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Open Government National Action Plan|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/06/united-states-releases-its-second-open-government-national-action-plan|publisher=The White House Blog|author=Sinai Nick and Smith Gayle|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal investigator is [[Marc Kuchner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diskdetective.org/#/team Disk Detective: Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Disk Detective was launched in January 2014, and is expected to continue till 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disk Detective|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/disk-detective/#.VCHrTitdUpK|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public (aka the users) is invited to search through images captured by space agency's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Releases New WISE Mission Catalog of Entire Infrared Sky|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20120314.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sky surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) and the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS).

The images in Disk Detective have all been pre-selected to be extra bright at wavelengths where circumstellar dust emits thermal radiation. They are at [[mid-infrared]], near-infrared and optical wavelengths. Disks are not the only heavenly objects that appear bright at [[infrared]] wavelengths; [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], galaxies, asteroids and interstellar dust clouds also emit at these wavelengths.  Computer [[algorithm]]s can't distinguish the difference, so it is necessary to examine all images by "eye" to make sure that the selected candidates are stars with disks, and not other [[celestial objects]].

==Classification==

At Disk Detective website, the images are presented in animated forms which are called flip books. The users view a flip book and classify the target object based on simple criteria, such as whether it is round in DSS2 or 2MASS images, or the object is extended beyond circle in WISE images, if there is more than one object in the circle or if it's off the crosshairs.

The ideal target is classified as '''good candidate''', and further vetted by the advanced research group into a list of '''debris disk of interest''' (or '''DDOI''') candidates.

The selected disk candidates will eventually become the future targets for NASA's [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]]. They also will be the topic for future publications in the scientific literature.

==Seeking objects==
The disks that NASA's scientists at the [[Goddard Space Flight Centre]] aim to find are [[debris disks]], which are older than 5 million years; and [[Young Stellar Object]], or YSO disks, which are younger than 5 million years.

==Discoveries==
The project has so far discovered the first debris disk with a white dwarf companion ([[HD 74389]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kuchner|first1=Marc J.|last2=Silverberg|first2=Steven M.|last3=Bans|first3=Alissa S.|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Shambo|last5=Kenyon|first5=Scott J.|last6=Debes|first6=John H.|last7=Currie|first7=Thayne|last8=Garcia|first8=Luciano|last9=Jung|first9=Dawoon|last10=Lintott|first10=Chris|last11=McElwain|first11=Michael|last12=Padgett|first12=Deborah L.|last13=Rebull|first13=Luisa M.|last14=Wisniewski|first14=John P.|last15=Nesvold|first15=Erika|last16=Schawinski|first16=Kevin|last17=Thaller|first17=Michelle L.|last18=Grady|first18=Carol A.|last19=Biggs|first19=Joseph|last20=Bosch|first20=Milton|last21=Cernohous|first21=Tadeás|last22=Luca|first22=Hugo A.

Most Villages have members, to whom they provide services upon request.  Services offered typically include transportation, light home maintenance and repair, and social activities.  Most Villages do not provide medical services or involved home maintenance, but provide referrals to those who do.

==History==

The first formal Village was founded in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of [[Boston]] in 2001.&lt;ref name = "Gross07"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/health/14aging.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1368796652-drkDpZ+iqzgT3gQJD6Dc9w A Grass-Roots Effort to Grow Old at Home]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 14, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ElNasser"&gt;Haya El Nasser, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-07-26-aging26_ST_N.htm?c.. 'Villages' let elderly grow old at home], ''USA Today'', July 26, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately one dozen residents of the historic neighborhood wanted "[[aging in place|to remain at home]]" once transportation and household chores became difficult, dangerous, or even impossible. They also wished to avoid becoming dependent on their children, but did not want to move to an old-age facility.  They founded an organization to provide these services to the organization's members, who must live in Beacon Hill or the adjacent Back Bay neighborhood.&lt;ref name = "Gross06"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/garden/09care.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Aging at Home: For a Lucky Few, a Wish Come True]" ''The New York Times'', February 9, 2006; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result has been called an "[[intentional community]]"&lt;ref name = "Span"&gt;Paula Span, "[http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/roommates-of-a-certain-age/ Sharing a Table, and Much More]", ''The New York Times'', October 15, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt; or a "virtual [[retirement community]]".&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;Barbara Whitaker, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/business/yourmoney/06retire.html?_r=0 These Days, 'Retirement Living' Can Mean Many Things]", ''The New York Times'', February 6, 2005; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization grew slowly, learning from its mistakes.&lt;ref name = "Gross06" /&gt;  After four years in existence, Beacon Hill Village was the subject of an article in ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name = "Whitaker" /&gt; and the idea spread.  Beacon Hill Village prepared a how-to manual for sale to those who would found other Villages.&lt;ref name = "Gross06" /&gt;  By 2010, there were more than 50 Villages in the United States.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt;  As of 2012, there were some 90 Villages in operation in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands, with more than 120 other Villages in the formation process.&lt;ref name = "VtVAbout"&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=65139 About VtV Network]"; accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2018, the idea had spread as far as South Korea and Finland.&lt;ref name = "BGlobe"&gt;Robert Weisman, "[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/07/volunteer-movement-becomes-more-vital-for-older-mass-residents/yeCQS3L6ITCfZY4Y55nAyI/story.html For some seniors, a cultural shift and a vital volunteerism]", ''The Boston Globe'', July  7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Operation==
A Village tends to be formed as a [[non-profit corporation]], with members, directors, and officers.&lt;ref name = "Rutgers"&gt;

Villages are largely funded through membership dues and fees, on the one hand, and donations and grants, on the other.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt; Some 90% of American Villages charge dues
,&lt;ref name = "2016Surv"&gt;Carrie L. Graham, Andrew E. Scharlach, Roscoe Nicholson, and Catherine O’Brien, ''[http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/MLIA_VillagesSurveyBriefFEB17_FNL.pdf 2016 National Survey of US Villages]'' University of California, Berkeley, Center for the Advanced Study of Aging Services &amp; Mather LifeWays Institute on Aging, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} but some charge no dues.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  They provide such services as transportation, grocery delivery, light home repairs, and dog walking, as well as organizing social activities.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ"&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=70769 Frequently Asked Questions]"; accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt; They typically pool the resources of a community in providing services.&lt;ref name = "Span" /&gt;  Most Villages do not provide medical services or involved home maintenance, but provide referrals to those who do.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana"&gt;Niharika Mandhana, [http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/growing-older-in-an-urban-village/ Growing Older in an Urban Village], ''The New York Times'', August 15, 2011. accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Village staff and volunteers might select and screen these outside providers, and can help coordinate members' appointments with them.&lt;ref name = "Evans"&gt;Robin Evans, [http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Senior-villages-that-help-elderly-stay-at-home-3235090.php Senior villages that help elderly stay at home come to West Coast], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Dec. 12, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Providers so identified may offer their services to Village members at reduced rates.&lt;ref name = "McGlade"&gt;Caitlin McGlade, [http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/08/30/for-elderly-at-home-it-takes-a-village.html For elderly at home, it takes a 'village'], ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', August 30, 2010; accessed 2013.05.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Villages tend to operate on one of three models.  The first, pioneered in the 1990s by Community Without Walls in [[Princeton, N.J.]], has numerous members, each of whom belongs to one of a number of "houses". Annual dues are very low or non-existent, and much of the activity of such a group is social.  Nearly all services are provided by volunteers. Members pay additional dues for further assistance and services needed.  The second form delivers both volunteer and paid help.  Dues are higher (and often subsidized for low-income members), and the level of services (which are typically provided without additional charge) tends to be more comprehensive.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt; This has been termed the "classic village model".&lt;ref name = "Moeller" /&gt;  A third model amounts to being a service exchange.  One member might pick up groceries for a neighbor; a second volunteer might then fix the first's leaky faucet.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  Historically, Villages have tended to operate in urban areas, with significant concentrations of both service providers and recipients, but they are spreading.&lt;ref name = "Bernstein"&gt;Nell Bernstein, [http://www.caring.com/blogs/caring-currents/elder-villages-independence-community-seniors Elder Villages Offer Independence Plus Community], Caring.com; updated Oct. 21, 2008; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many experts believe that the second model, with both paid staff and volunteers, has the most widespread applicability.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  Currently, Villages are largely found in [[middle-class]] and upper-income neighborhoods; the movement has received some criticism for its perceived failure to reach more diverse communities to date.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;  The [[Washington, D.C.]], area, with its large proportion of people who moved from elsewhere and thus do not have a local family network, has a particularly high concentration of Villages;&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pianin1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tara Bahrampour, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/through-a-growing-number-of-senior-villages-in-the-dc-area-aging-in-place-becomes-easier/2014/02/06/e51fc660-7fbf-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html Through a growing number of senior villages in the D.C. area, aging in place becomes easier], ''The Washington Post'', Feb. 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the District of Columbia Office on Aging has a Web page dedicated to "Senior Villages" and has produced a "how to" guide for establishing a new Village.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Office on Aging, "[http://dcoa.dc.gov/service/senior-villages Senior Villages]"; accessed 2015.10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of sustainability, with the related issue of growth, has arisen in a number of Villages.  In some, the founders have been surprised at the difficulty they experience in their efforts to expand membership beyond the initial group, which can impair efforts to grow the membership to the point at which a Village can become self-sustaining.  Many people approached by a Village do not feel ready to join, while the people most in need of a Village's services are less likely to hear about them.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pianin1"&gt;Alex Pianin, [http://www.currentnewspapers.com/admin/uploadfiles/NW%2002-27-2013%201.pdf Cleveland Park gym spotlights senior athletes in photo display]", ''The Northwest Current'', Feb. 27, 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Villages may share ideas and experiences through the Village to Village ("VtV") network.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;  VtV was established in 2010 by Beacon Hill Village and [[NCB Capital Impact|Capital Impact]] in response to requests from a number of Villages.  At the end of 2014, Capital Impact withdrew from the partnership and in March 2015, the organization, formally organized as a limited liability company, was converted to a corporation, named Village to Village Network, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network [http://vtvnetwork.org/ homepage]; accessed 2015.04.20.&lt;/ref&gt;  It serves as a clearinghouse for inter-Village communications, and provides information to help communities establish and operate their own Villages.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;  It further organizes an annual meeting, the National Village Gathering, at which local Village officers and staffers may meet those from other Villages to share information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=156268 The 2014 National Village Gathering]"; accessed 2014.09.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--this paragraph seems somewhat out of place, if not redundant and maybe self-congratulatory--&gt;The Beacon Hill Village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beacon Hill Village|url=http://www.beaconhillvillage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in Boston began as a community of older adults joining forces to create "programs and services that will enable them to live at home, remaining independent as long as possible."  The ‘Village’ model for aging in place is based on the Beacon Hill Village established in Boston in 2001. The ‘Village’ model is a grassroots, consumer driven, and volunteer first model.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"&gt;McDonough, K. E., &amp; Davitt, J. K. (2011).

E. 2011"/&gt; The model relies on informal network of community members.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; Volunteers are the backbone of the model, while the ‘Village’ staff is responsible for administration including vetting, training, and management of volunteers.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K.

'''Feature geometry''' is a [[Phonology|phonological]] theory which represents [[distinctive features]] as a structured hierarchy rather than a matrix or a set. Feature geometry grew out of [[autosegmental phonology]], which emphasizes the autonomous nature of distinctive features and the non-uniform relationships among them. Feature geometry recognizes that some sets of features often pattern together in phonological and phonotactic generalizations, while others rarely interact. Feature geometry thus formally encodes groups of features under nodes in a tree: features that commonly pattern together are said to share a parent node, and operations on this set can be encoded as operation on the parent node.

One node in feature geometries is the Laryngeal node. The Laryngeal node is an organizing node that dominates the features of the [[Distinctive feature#Laryngeal features|larynx]], usually taken to be [voice], [constricted glottis], and [spread glottis]. It is common for these three features to pattern together in the phonology of the world's languages to the exclusion of every other feature, and in feature geometry, this follows from the tree representation. Similarly, feature geometries generally include a Place node that is the dominant node of the [[Distinctive feature#Place features|place features]], which also often pattern together. Feature geometry is easily compatible with theories of [[underspecification]] and can represent incomplete segments by missing nodes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Root node is the topmost node of the feature tree and works as the formal organizing unit of the segment, and in some frameworks encodes the major class features such as [consonantal], [sonorant], and [approximant]. Some features such as [nasal] and [lateral] are sometimes dependent of the root node, or sometimes of a Supralaryngeal node along with Place. Other features such as [anterior] and [distributed] are usually dependent from the Coronal place feature.

The first formal model of feature geometry was introduced in print by [[Nick Clements|George N. Clements]] in 1985, drawing on unpublished work by K.P. Mohanon and Joan Mascaró. Another precursor to feature geometry was proposed by Roger Lass in 1976, in which he proposed a laryngeal feature submatrix within a distinctive feature matrix. Other important models have been proposed by Elizabeth Sagey (1986), John J. McCarthy (1988), and Clements &amp; Hume (1995). Models vary widely in the number of the hierarchical nodes and in how consonant and vowel features are treated.

Feature geometry has attracted formal and conceptual criticism. In 2003 [[Charles Reiss]] argued that feature geometry is insufficiently powerful to account for a class of phonological rules that involve dependencies between segments, such as partial and total identity and nonidentity. Feature geometry is unable to encode these properties. In 2008 [[Jeff Mielke]] argued that feature geometry merely recapitulated physiological organization, and that since the influence of articulation on [[sound changes|sound change]] will independently create patterns in the behavior of features, feature geometry recapitulates diachrony and is redundant as a theory of the mental organisation of phonology.

The '''''Foundation'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] book series written by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. For nearly thirty years, the series was a trilogy: ''[[Foundation (Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'', and ''[[Second Foundation]]''. It won the one-time [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/| title=1966 Hugo Awards| publisher=[[Hugo Award]]| website=thehugoawards.org| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html| title=The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966| accessdate=July 28, 2017| publisher=[[New England Science Fiction Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov began adding to the series in 1981, with two sequels: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', and two prequels: ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'']] and [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]], indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe.

The premise of the series is that the mathematician [[Hari Seldon]] spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a concept of [[mathematical sociology]]. Using the laws of [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]], it can predict the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the [[Galactic Empire (Isaac Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], which encompasses the entire [[Milky Way]], and a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. Seldon's calculations also show there is a way to limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To ensure the more favorable outcome and reduce human misery during the intervening period, Seldon creates the Foundation – a group of talented artisans and engineers positioned at the twinned extreme ends of the galaxy – to preserve and expand on humanity's collective knowledge, and thus become the foundation for the accelerated resurgence of this new galactic empire.

==Publication history==

===Original stories===
The original trilogy of novels were originally a series of eight short stories published in ''[[Astounding Magazine]]'' between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor [[John W. Campbell]], with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. La edad de oro II. Plaza &amp; Janes. 1987. P 252–253 (Spanish language translation of [[The Early Asimov]]) See afterword for the "Legal Rites" story.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov wrote these early stories in his [[West Philadelphia]] apartment when he worked at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].

===''Foundation'' trilogy===
The first four stories were collected, along with a new story taking place before the others, as a [[fixup]] published by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951 as ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''. The remainder of the stories were published in pairs by Gnome as ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952) and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953), resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation's Edge |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year=1982 |page=1 |isbn=0-553-29338-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later sequels and prequels===
In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation and Earth |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year= |pages= |isbn=0-553-58757-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Asimov followed up with yet another sequel, ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), which was followed by the prequels ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1993), published after his death in 1992. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his ''Foundation'' series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in ''Foundation's Edge'': an obscure tradition about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in ''[[Robots of Dawn]]'', which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements were to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called ''[[carbon|C]]/[[iron|Fe]]'' (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word ''psychohistory'' is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon's work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called ''Spacer'' culture, are also exemplified by the events described in ''[[The Naked Sun]]''.

==Plot==

''Note: This plot is listed in the fictional chronological order of the stories in the series, which is not the order of publication. The series itself was left as a trilogy for many years, comprising "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and "Second Foundation". The two novels set chronologically earlier than the original trilogy, and the two which follow it, were later added to the series.''

===''Prelude to Foundation''===
{{main|Prelude to Foundation}}
''Prelude to Foundation'' opens on the planet [[Trantor]], the empire's capital planet, the day after [[Hari Seldon]] has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and [[Dors Venabili]], a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by [[Chetter Hummin]] who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.

===''Forward the Foundation''===
{{main|Forward the Foundation}}
Eight years after the events of ''Prelude'', Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.

===''Foundation''===
{{main|Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)}}
Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]''. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the "Encyclopedists" be exiled to a remote planet, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]]. Seldon agrees to these terms – and also secretly establishes a second Foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the "opposite end" of the galaxy.

After fifty years on Terminus, and with Seldon now deceased, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. At the same time, a vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open. The vault reveals a pre-recorded [[hologram]] of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the dark ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on following his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme "crises" – known as "Seldon Crises" – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the "opposite end" of the galaxy, and then falls silent.

The Mayor of Terminus City, [[Salvor Hardin]], proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is promoted to Mayor of Terminus (the planet). Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, [[Hober Mallow]], becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.

===''Foundation and Empire''===
{{main|Foundation and Empire}}
An ambitious general of the current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a direct threat to the Emperor himself and been recalled.

A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize the Mule is a [[mutant]], unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. [[Toran and Bayta Darell]], accompanied by [[Ebling Mis]] – the galaxy's current greatest psychologist – and a court jester familiar with the Mule named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from the Mule himself), set out to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule's reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help.  He is successful and also deduces that the Mule's success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is killed by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location, having realised that Magnifico is in fact the Mule and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation also. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, the Mule leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.

===''Second Foundation''===
{{main|Second Foundation}}
As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly. It consists of the descendants of Seldon's psychohistorians. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their own use of mental sciences. The Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule, who returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.

However, as a result, the first Foundation has learned something of the Second Foundation beyond the simple fact that it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in light of that knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. Additionally, the first Foundation instead starts to resentfully consider the other as a rival, and begins to develop equipment related to detecting and blocking mental influence, in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to unravel the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the minimal clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (being the "opposite end" of a galaxy, for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of fifty members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation. No longer concerned at the perceived threat, their behaviors as a society will tend to be those anticipated by the Plan.

In fact the group of fifty were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be captured and give the impression that they composed the whole of the Second Foundation, so that the Seldon Plan would be able to continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation, itself, is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor. The clue "at Star's End" was not a physical clue, but was instead based on an old saying, "All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end." Seldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at "opposite ends" of the galaxy, but in a sociological rather than physical sense. The first Foundation was located on the Periphery of the galaxy, where the Empire's influence was minimal; the Second Foundation was on Trantor, where, even in its dying days, the Empire's power and culture was strongest.

===''Foundation's Edge''===
{{main|Foundation's Edge}}
Believing the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician [[Golan Trevize]] is sent into [[exile]] by the current Mayor of the Foundation, [[List of minor Foundation series characters#Harla Branno|Harla Branno]], to uncover the Second Foundation; [[Golan Trevize|Trevize]] is accompanied by a scholar named [[Janov Pelorat]]. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action.

Meanwhile, [[Stor Gendibal]], a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native.

Using the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both the First and Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.

After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia's path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno's and Gendibal's minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal – now leader (and First Speaker) of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he has intuited (is "sure") that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.

===''Foundation and Earth''===
{{main|Foundation and Earth}}
Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten worlds of [[Aurora (planet)|Aurora]], [[Solaria]], and finally [[Melpomenia]]. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers.

Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet.

Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). However, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth's satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon's core, where they meet a robot named [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will cease to function. Despite replacing his [[positronic]] brain (which contain 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his current one, or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. However, some additional time can be won to ensure the long term benefit of humanity by merging [[R. Daneel Olivaw|R. Daniel Olivaw's]] mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria.

Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child's superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a "yes") as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child's benefit, but that she may have sinister intentions about it.

==Development and themes==
The early stories were inspired by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire." The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in SF fandom, associated with the [[Futurians]], known as [[John Michel (science fiction)|Michelism]].

The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition, and act as a moral allegory on the modern world. The ''Foundation'' series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.

Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. Hari Seldon himself hopes that his Plan will "reduce 30,000 years of Dark Ages and barbarism to a single millennium," a goal of exceptional moral gravity. Yet events within it are often treated as inevitable and necessary, rather than deviations from the greater good. For example, the Foundation slides gradually into oligarchy and dictatorship prior to the appearance of the galactic conqueror, known as the [[Mule (Foundation)|Mule]], who was able to succeed through the random chance of a telepathic mutation. But, for the most part, the book treats the purpose of [[Seldon Plan|Seldon's plan]] as unquestionable, and that slide as being necessary in it, rather than mulling over whether the slide is, on the whole, positive or negative.

The books also wrestle with the idea of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an inevitable mechanism of society, a vast mindless [[mob mentality]] of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as [[Salvor Hardin]] and [[Hober Mallow]] to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which turns upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as the primary reason for the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory.

Asimov tried unsuccessfully to end the series with ''[[Second Foundation]]''. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. This was followed shortly thereafter by ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding [[Gaia (Foundation universe)#Galaxia|Galaxia]], a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow [[Janet Asimov]] (in her biography of Isaac, ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]''), he had no idea how to continue after ''Foundation and Earth'', so he started writing the prequels.

==The Foundation series==

===Merging with other series===
The series is set in the same universe as Asimov's first published novel, ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', although ''Foundation'' takes place about 10,000 years later. ''Pebble in the Sky'' became the basis for the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]]. Then, at some unknown date (prior to writing ''Foundation's Edge'') Asimov decided to merge the ''Foundation''/''Empire'' series with his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]]. Thus, all three series are set in the same universe, giving them a combined length of 15 novels, and a total of about 1,500,000 words (see the [[#Asimov's books within the Foundation series|List of books]] below). The merge also created a time-span of the series of around 20,000 years.

The stand-alone story ''[[Nemesis (Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'' is also in the same continuity; being referenced in ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'', where [[Hari Seldon]] refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis." Commentators noted that ''Nemesis'' contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the ''Foundation'' universe.&lt;ref name="From Robots to Foundations" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Codex|first1=Regius|title=From Robots to Foundations|date=2014|location=Wiesbaden/Ljubljana|isbn=1499569823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline inconsistencies===
Early on during Asimov's original world-building of the ''Foundation'' universe, he established within the first published stories a chronology placing the tales about 50,000 years into the future from the time they were written (''circa'' 1940). This precept was maintained in the pages of his first novel ''Pebble in the Sky'', wherein Imperial archaeologist [[Bel Arvardan]] refers to ancient human strata discovered in the Sirius sector dating back "some 50,000 years". However, when Asimov decided decades later to retroactively integrate the universe of his ''Foundation'' and ''Galactic Empire'' novels with that of his ''Robot'' stories, a number of changes and minor discrepancies surfaced – the character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was established as having existed for some 20,000 years, with the original ''Robot'' novels featuring the character occurring not more than a couple of millennia after the early-21st century [[Susan Calvin]] short stories. Also, in ''Foundation's Edge'', mankind was referred to as having possessed interstellar space travel for only 22,000 years, a far cry from the 50 millennia of earlier works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the spring of 1955, Asimov published an early timeline in the pages of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the ''Foundation'' universe's history at that point in his life, which vastly differs from its modern-era counterpart. Many included stories would later be either jettisoned from the later chronology or temporally relocated by the author. Also, the aforementioned lengthier scope of time was changed. For example, in the original 1950s timeline, humanity does not discover the hyperspatial drive until around 5000 AD, whereas in the reincorporated ''Robot'' universe chronology, the first interstellar jump occurs in 2029 AD, during the events of ''[[I, Robot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Timeline.html |title=An Early Asimov Timeline |publisher=Asimovreviews.net |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other authors==
Asimov's novels covered only 500 of the expected 1,000 years it would take for the Foundation to become a galactic empire. The novels written after Asimov did not continue the timeline but rather sought to fill in gaps in the earlier stories. The ''Foundation'' universe was once again revisited in 1989's ''[[Foundation's Friends]]'', a collection of short stories written by many prominent science fiction authors of that time. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s "[[The Originist]]" clarifies the founding of the Second Foundation shortly after Seldon's death; [[Harry Turtledove]]'s "Trantor Falls" tells of the efforts by the Second Foundation to survive during the sacking of Trantor, the imperial capital and Second Foundation's home; and [[George Zebrowski]]'s "Foundation's Conscience" is about the efforts of a historian to document Seldon's work following the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.

Also, shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels, known as the Caliban trilogy by [[Roger MacBride Allen]], set between ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] world Inferno, a planet where an ecological crisis forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative.

After Asimov's death and at the request of Janet Asimov and the Asimov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza approached [[Gregory Benford]], and asked him to write another ''Foundation'' story. He eventually agreed, and with Vicinanza and after speaking "to several authors about [the] project", formed a plan for a trilogy with "two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from the Author's afterword in Foundation's Fear (Benford)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'' (1997) takes place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''; ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of ''Foundation'', filling in background; ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and ties together a number of loose ends. These books are now claimed by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikander.org/foundation.php|title=TimeLine for the Robots &amp; Foundations Universe|first=|last=sikander|website=www.sikander.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaedrin.com/fun/asimov/newfound.html|title=The Second Foundation Series - Kaedrin's Guide to Isaac Asimov|website=kaedrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collectively be a "''Second Foundation'' trilogy", although they are inserts into pre-existing prequels and some of the earlier Foundation storylines and not generally recognized as a new Trilogy.

In an epilogue to ''Foundation's Triumph'', Brin noted he could imagine himself or a different author writing another sequel to add to ''Foundation's Triumph'', feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/foundationdenouement1.html|title=worlds of DAVID BRIN|first=David Brin, Runaway|last=Serfer|website=www.davidbrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Asimov estate authorized publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov's ''Robots and Empire'', are ''Mirage'' (2000), ''Chimera'' (2001), and ''Aurora'' (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, [[Alexander C. Irvine]]'s ''Have Robot, Will Travel'' (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy.

In 2001, Donald Kingsbury published the novel ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]'', set in the Foundation universe after the start of the Second Empire.

Novels by various authors (''Isaac Asimov's'' ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robot City|Robot City]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens|Robots and Aliens]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots in Time|Robots in Time]]'' series) are loosely connected to the ''Robot'' series, but contain many inconsistencies with Asimov's books, and are not generally considered part of the ''Foundation'' series.

In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of'' Robots and Chaos'', the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author [[Mickey Zucker Reichert]]. The book was published in November 2011 under the title ''I, Robot: To Protect''.

==Cultural impact==

===Impact in nonfiction===
In ''Learned Optimism'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Seligman|Seligman, Martin]]. ''Learned Optimism'' ((c) 1998 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.), 185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] identifies the ''Foundation'' series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US elections]], and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman discusses the successful prediction of the Presidential and 33 Senatorial elections based on an evaluation of the candidates' optimism as expressed in their speeches, and the principle that American voters systematically favor optimistic candidates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''To Renew America'', [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] wrote how he was influenced by reading the ''Foundation'' trilogy in high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/143446 "Newt Gingrich the Galactic Historian"]. [[Ray Smock]], [[History News Network]], 08 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], winner of the 2008 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], credits the ''Foundation'' series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/04/paul-krugman-asimov-economics|title=Paul Krugman: Asimov's Foundation novels grounded my economics|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec08/nobelkrugman_10-13.html|title=U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonfiction PBS series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] referred to an ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' in the episodes "Encyclopaedia Galactica" and "Who Speaks for Earth".

===Awards===
In 1966, the ''Foundation'' trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series". The runners-up for the award were ''[[Barsoom series]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''[[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History series]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], ''[[Lensman series]]'' by [[Edward E. Smith]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/|title=1966 Hugo Awards|date=26 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation series is still the only series so honored. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor ''The Lord of the Rings'', and he was amazed when his work won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|date= 1980|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-15544-1|at= chapter 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has won three other Hugo Awards. ''Foundation's Edge'' won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, "The Mule" (the major part of ''Foundation and Empire'') for Best Novel (1946) and "Foundation" (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943).

===Impact in fiction and entertainment===
Science fiction parodies, such as [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Bill, the Galactic Hero]]'', often display clear ''Foundation'' influences. For instance, "The Guide" of the former is a spoof of the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', and the series actually mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather "dry", and consequently sells fewer copies than the guide; the latter also features the ultra-urbanized Imperial planet Helior, often parodying the logistics such a planet-city would require, but that Asimov's novel downplays when describing Trantor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1995, [[Donald Kingsbury]] wrote "Historical Crisis", which he later expanded into a novel, ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]''. It takes place about 2,000 years after ''Foundation'', after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all ''Foundation''-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and [[computer science]], as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself.

In 1998, the novel [[Spectre (Star Trek)]] (part of the [[Shatnerverse]] series) by [[William Shatner]] and [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] states that the [[Mirror Universe]] divergent path has been studied by the ''Seldon Psychohistory Institute''.

The [[oboe]]-like holophonor in [[Matt Groening]]'s animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'' is based directly upon the "Visi-Sonor" which [[Mule (Foundation)|Magnifico]] plays in ''Foundation and Empire.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Of course, you'll remember the holophonor [...] as we've said [...] is inspired by an instrument in [...] Foundation, one of the Foundation books, Isaac Asimov, the Mule plays an instrument much like that, except that it controls peoples minds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Visi-Sonor" is also mirrored in an episode of ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', where a child's television character plays an instrument that induces mind control over children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During the 2006–2007 [[Marvel Comics]] [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, in [[Fantastic Four]] #542 [[Mister Fantastic]] revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series.

According to lead singer [[Ian Gillan]], the hard rock band [[Deep Purple]]'s song ''The Mule'' is based on the Foundation character: "Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It's been a while but I'm sure you've made the right connection...Asimov was required reading in the 60's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillan.com/qa-62.html|title=Caramba - Q&amp;a|website=www.gillan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio adaptation===
An eight-part [[The Foundation Trilogy (BBC Radio)|radio adaptation]] of the original trilogy, with sound design by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1973 – one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. A [[BBC 7]] [[rerun]] commenced in July 2003.

Adapted by [[Patrick Tull]] (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with [[Geoffrey Beevers]] as Gaal Dornick, [[Lee Montague]] as Salvor Hardin, [[Julian Glover]] as Hober Mallow, [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Bel Riose, [[Maurice Denham]] as Ebling Mis and [[Prunella Scales]] as Lady Callia.

===Film adaptation===
By 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] had spent $1.5&amp;nbsp;million developing a film version of the ''Foundation Trilogy''. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Brian | authorlink = Brian Sibley | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harpercollins | year =2006 | location =London | page =403 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 |chapter=Three-Ring Circus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2008, [[New Line Cinema]] co-founders [[Bob Shaye]] and [[Michael Lynne]] were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rich Drees| title = FOUNDATION Heading To Big Screen| publisher = Film Buff OnLine | date = 2008-07-29 | url = http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/?p=842/ | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Columbia Pictures]] (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted [[Roland Emmerich]] to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000386|Roland Emmerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later, the studio hired [[Dante Harper]] to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize and [[HBO]] acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sneider"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Sneider |first1 = Jeff |title = 'Interstellar's' Jonah Nolan Developing 'Foundation' Series for HBO, WBTV (Exclusive) |website = [[TheWrap]] |url = http://www.thewrap.com/interstellars-jonah-nolan-developing-foundation-series-for-hbo-wbtv-exclusive/ |date = 10 November 2014 |accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, ''[[TheWrap]]'' reported that [[Jonathan Nolan]] was writing and producing a TV series based on the ''Foundation Trilogy'' for [[HBO]].&lt;ref name=Sneider/&gt; Nolan confirmed his involvement at a [[Paley Center for Media|Paley Center]] event on April 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PaleyLive: An Evening with the Cast of Person of Interest|website=[[Yahoo]]|url=https://screen.yahoo.com/live/event/paleylive-an-evening-with-person-of-interest|date=13 April 2015|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' reported that [[Skydance Media]] will produce a TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike, Jr.|title=Skydance Trying Asimov's 'Foundation' As TV Series; David Goyer, Josh Friedman To Adapt|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/foundation-isaac-asimov-skydance-television-series-deal-david-goyer-josh-friedman-science-fiction-star-wars-1202120701/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=27 June 2017|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018 it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has commissioned a 10 episode straight-to-series order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Foundation’: Apple Gives Series Order To Adaptation Of Isaac Asimov’s Sci-Fi Classic From David Goyer &amp; Josh Friedman|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/foundation-apple-gives-series-order-to-adaptation-of-isaac-asimovs-sci-fi-classic-from-david-goyer-josh-friedman-1202450917/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=23 August 2018|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books within the ''Foundation'' series==
===Overview===
The "Author's Note" of ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' contains the chronological ordering of Asimov's science fiction books, in which he also said, "they were not written in the order in which (perhaps) they should be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Prelude to Foundation|year=1988|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-553-90095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forward the Foundation'' does not appear in Asimov's list, as it was not yet published at the time, and the order of the Empire novels in Asimov's list is not entirely consistent with other lists. For example, the 1983 [[Ballantine Books]] printing of ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' lists the Empire novels as: ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]], [[The Currents of Space]]'', and ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''. Given that ''The Currents of Space'' includes Trantor and that ''The Stars, Like Dust'' does not, these two books possibly were accidentally reversed in Asimov's list.

===Asimov's books within the ''Foundation'' series===
# ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) and/or ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)
# ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' (1954)

Another alternative is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the ''Foundation'' prequels prior to reading the ''Foundation Trilogy'' fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises.{{original research inline|date=May 2011}} In that same ''Author's Note'', Asimov noted that there is room for a book between ''Robots and Empire (5)'' and ''The Currents of Space (6)'', and that he could follow ''Foundation and Earth (15)'' with additional volumes.

===Tangential books===
While not mentioned in the above list, the books ''[[The End of Eternity]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nemesis (Asimov)|Nemesis]]'' (1989) are also referenced in the series.

''The End of Eternity'' is vaguely referenced in ''Foundation's Edge'', where a character mentions the Eternals, whose "task it was to choose a [[reality]] that would be most suitable to Humanity". (''The End of Eternity'' also refers to a "Galactic Empire" within its story.) In ''Forward the Foundation'', Hari Seldon refers to a 20-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis", a reference to ''Nemesis''. In ''Nemesis'', the main colony is one of the Fifty Settlements, a collection of orbital colonies that form a state. The Fifty Settlements possibly were the basis for the fifty Spacer worlds in the ''Robot'' stories. The implication at the end of ''Nemesis'' that the inhabitants of the off-Earth colonies are splitting off from Earthbound humans could also be connected to a similar implication about the Spacers in [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot'' books.

On the other hand, these references might be just jokes by Asimov, and the stories mentioned could be just those really written by himself (as seen in ''The Robots of Dawn'', where Fastolfe makes a reference to Asimov's ''Liar!'') and still being read twenty thousand years later. Furthermore, Asimov himself did not mention ''The End of Eternity'' in the series listing from ''Prelude to Foundation''. As for ''Nemesis'', it was written after ''Prelude to Foundation'', but in the author's note Asimov explicitly states that the book is not part of the ''Foundation'' or ''Empire'' series, but that some day he might tie it to the others.

[[Contact mechanics]] is the study of the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[solids]] that touch each other at one or more points.&lt;ref name=Johnson1985&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=K.L.|title=Contact Mechanics|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popov2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Popov|first=V.L.|title=Contact Mechanics and Friction. Physical Principles and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be divided into compressive and adhesive forces in the direction perpendicular to the interface, and [[friction]]al forces in the tangential direction. '''Frictional contact mechanics''' is the study of the deformation of bodies in the presence of frictional effects, whereas ''frictionless contact mechanics'' assumes the absence of such effects.

Frictional contact mechanics is concerned with a large range of different scales.
* At the macroscopic scale, it is applied for the investigation of the motion of contacting bodies (see [[Contact dynamics]]). For instance the bouncing of a rubber ball on a surface depends on the frictional interaction at the contact interface. Here the total force versus indentation and lateral displacement are of main concern.
* At the intermediate scale, one is interested in the local [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], [[deformation (engineering)|strains]] and [[deformation (engineering)|deformations]] of the contacting bodies in and near the contact area. For instance to derive or validate contact models at the macroscopic scale, or to investigate [[wear]] and [[fatigue (material)|damage]] of the contacting bodies' surfaces. Application areas of this scale are tire-pavement interaction, railway wheel-rail interaction, roller bearing analysis, etc.
* Finally, at the microscopic and nano-scales, contact mechanics is used to increase our understanding of [[tribology|tribological systems]] (e.g., investigate the origin of [[friction]]) and for the engineering of advanced devices like [[atomic force microscope]]s and [[MEMS]] devices.
This page is mainly concerned with the second scale: getting basic insight in the stresses and deformations in and near the contact patch, without paying too much attention to the detailed mechanisms by which they come about.

== History ==
Several famous scientists,engineers and mathematician contributed to our understanding of friction.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://depts.washington.edu/nanolab/ChemE554/Summaries%20ChemE%20554/Introduction%20Tribology.htm
| title = Introduction to Tribology – Friction| accessdate = 2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They include [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Guillaume Amontons]], [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], [[Leonhard Euler]], and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]]. Later, [[Nikolai Pavlovich Petrov]], [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Richard Stribeck]] supplemented this understanding with theories of [[lubrication]].

Deformation of solid materials was investigated in the 17th and 18th centuries by [[Robert Hooke]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], and in the 19th and 20th centuries by [[d’Alembert]] and [[Stephen Timoshenko|Timoshenko]]. With respect to contact mechanics the classical contribution by [[Heinrich Hertz]]&lt;ref name=Hertz1882&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hertz |first= Heinrich|authorlink=Heinrich Hertz |year=1882|title=Contact between solid elastic bodies |journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|volume=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands out. Further the [[Linear elasticity#Solutions for elastostatic cases|fundamental solutions]] by Boussinesq and Cerruti are of primary importance for the investigation of frictional contact problems in the [[Linear elasticity|(linearly) elastic]] regime.

[[File:Illustration of creepage for a railway wheel.png|thumb|In railway applications one wants to know the relation between creepage (velocity difference) &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and the friction force &lt;math&gt;F_w&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Classical results for a true frictional contact problem concern the papers by F.W. Carter (1926) and H. Fromm (1927). They independently presented the creep versus creep force relation for a cylinder on a plane or for two cylinders in steady rolling contact using Coulomb’s dry friction law (see below).&lt;ref name=Knothe2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knothe|first=K.|title=History of wheel/rail contact mechanics: from Redtenbacher to Kalker|journal=Vehicle System Dynamics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1-2|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/00423110701586469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are applied to railway locomotive traction, and for understanding the [[hunting oscillation]] of railway vehicles. With respect to sliding, the classical solutions are due to C. Cattaneo (1938) and R.D. Mindlin (1949), who considered the tangential shifting of a sphere on a plane (see below).&lt;ref name="Johnson1985"/&gt;

In the 1950s, interest in the rolling contact of railway wheels grew. In 1958, K.L. Johnson presented an approximate approach for the 3D frictional problem with Hertzian geometry, with either lateral or spin creepage. Among others he found that spin creepage, which is symmetric about the center of the contact patch, leads to a net lateral force in rolling conditions. This is due to the fore-aft differences in the distribution of tractions in the contact patch.

In 1967, Joost Kalker published his milestone PhD thesis on the linear theory for rolling contact.&lt;ref name=Kalker1967&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalker|first=Joost J.|title=On the rolling contact of two elastic bodies in the presence of dry friction|year=1967|publisher=Delft University of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is exact for the situation of an infinite friction coefficient in which case the slip area vanishes, and is approximative for non-vanishing creepages. It does assume Coulomb's friction law, which more or less requires (scrupulously) clean surfaces. This theory is for massive bodies such as the railway wheel-rail contact. With respect to road-tire interaction, an important contribution concerns the so-called magic tire formula by [[Hans Pacejka]].&lt;ref name=Pacejka2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacejka|first=Hans|title=Tire and Vehicle Dynamics|year=2002|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, many numerical models were devised. Particularly [[Calculus of variations|variational approaches]], such as those relying on Duvaut and Lion’s existence and uniqueness theories. Over time, these grew into [[Finite element method|finite element approaches]] for contact problems with general material models and geometries, and into [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] based approaches for so-called smooth-edged contact problems for linearly elastic materials. Models of the first category were presented by Laursen&lt;ref name=Laursen2002&gt;Laursen, T.A., 2002, ''Computational Contact and Impact Mechanics, Fundamentals of Modeling Interfacial Phenomena in Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis'', Springer, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; and by Wriggers.&lt;ref name=Wriggers2006&gt;Wriggers, P., 2006, ''Computational Contact Mechanics, 2nd ed.'', Springer, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter category is Kalker’s CONTACT model.&lt;ref name=Kalker1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalker|first=J.J.|title=Three-Dimensional Elastic Bodies in Rolling Contact|year=1990|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawback of the well-founded variational approaches is their large computation times. Therefore, many different approximate approaches were devised as well. Several well-known approximate theories for the rolling contact problem are Kalker’s FASTSIM approach, the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins formula, and Polach’s approach.

More information on the history of the wheel/rail contact problem is provided in Knothe's paper.&lt;ref name="Knothe2008"/&gt; Further Johnson collected in his book a tremendous amount of information on contact mechanics and related subjects.&lt;ref name="Johnson1985"/&gt; With respect to rolling contact mechanics an overview of various theories is presented by Kalker as well.&lt;ref name="Kalker1990"/&gt; Finally the proceedings of a CISM course  are of interest, which provide an introduction to more advanced aspects of rolling contact theory.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen2000&gt;{{cite book|title=Rolling Contact Phenomena|year=2000|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Wien New York|editor=B. Jacobsen and J.J. Kalker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem formulation==
Central in the analysis of frictional contact problems is the understanding that the [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] at the surface of each body are spatially varying. Consequently, the [[Infinitesimal strain theory|strains]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformations]] of the bodies are varying with position too. And the motion of particles of the contacting bodies can be different at different locations: in part of the contact patch particles of the opposing bodies may adhere (stick) to each other, whereas in other parts of the contact patch relative movement occurs. This local relative sliding is called micro-[[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slip]].

This subdivision of the contact area into stick (adhesion) and slip areas manifests itself a.o. in [[fretting|fretting wear]]. Note that [[wear]] occurs only where [[power (physics)|power]] is dissipated, which requires stress and local relative [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] (slip) between the two surfaces.

The size and shape of the contact patch itself and of its adhesion and slip areas are generally unknown in advance. If these were known, then the elastic fields in the two bodies could be solved independently from each other and the problem would not be a contact problem anymore.

Three different components can be distinguished in a contact problem.
# First of all, there is the '''deformation of the''' separate '''bodies''' in reaction to loads applied on their surfaces. This is the subject of general [[continuum mechanics]]. It depends largely on the geometry of the bodies and on their ([[constitutive equations|constitutive]]) [[materials science|material behavior]] (e.g. [[linear elasticity|elastic]] vs. [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] response, homogeneous vs. layered structure etc.).
# Secondly, there is the '''overall motion''' of the bodies relative to each other. For instance the bodies can be at rest (statics) or approaching each other quickly ([[impact (mechanics)|impact]]), and can be shifted (sliding) or rotated ([[rolling]]) over each other. These overall motions are generally studied in [[classical mechanics]], see for instance [[multibody dynamics]].
# Finally there are the '''processes at the contact interface''': compression and [[adhesion]] in the direction perpendicular to the interface, and [[friction]] and micro-slip in the [[tangent|tangential directions]].

The last aspect is the primary concern of contact mechanics. It is described in terms of so-called ''contact conditions''.
For the direction perpendicular to the interface, the normal contact problem, adhesion effects are usually small (at larger spatial scales) and the following conditions are typically employed:
# The gap &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; between the two surfaces must be zero (contact) or strictly positive (separation, &lt;math&gt;e_n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;);
# The normal stress &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; acting on each body is zero (separation) or compressive (&lt;math&gt;p_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; in contact).
Mathematically: &lt;math&gt; e_n \ge 0, p_n \ge 0, e_n\cdot p_n = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;e_n, p_n&lt;/math&gt; are functions that vary with the position along the bodies' surfaces.

In the tangential directions the following conditions are often used:
# The local (tangential) shear stress &lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = (p_x, p_y)^\mathsf{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the normal direction parallel to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis) cannot exceed a certain position-dependent maximum, the so-called traction bound &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;;
# Where the magnitude of tangential traction falls below the traction bound &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{p}\|&lt;g\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the opposing surfaces adhere together and micro-slip vanishes, &lt;math&gt;\vec{s} = (s_x, s_y)^\mathsf{T} = \vec{0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;;
# Micro-slip occurs where the tangential tractions are at the traction bound; the direction of the tangential traction is then opposite to the direction of micro-slip &lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = -g\vec{s}/\|\vec{s}\|\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The precise form of the traction bound is the so-called local friction law. For this Coulomb's (global) friction law is often applied locally: &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{p}\|\le g = \mu p_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the friction coefficient. More detailed formulae are also possible, for instance with &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; depending on temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, local sliding velocity &lt;math&gt;\|\vec{s}\|&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

== Solutions for static cases==

=== Rope on a bollard, the capstan equation ===
[[File:Elastic rope on a bollard.png|thumb|Illustration of an elastic rope wrapped around a fixed item such as a bollard. The contact area is divided into stick and slip zones, depending on the loads exerted on both ends and on the loading history.]]
Consider a rope where equal forces (e.g., &lt;math&gt;F_\text{hold} = 400\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;) are exerted on both sides. By this the rope is stretched a bit and an internal [[tension (physics)|tension]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is induced (&lt;math&gt;T = 400\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; on every position along the rope). The rope is wrapped around a fixed item such as a [[bollard]]; it is bent and makes contact to the item's surface over a contact angle (e.g., &lt;math&gt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;). Normal pressure comes into being between the rope and bollard, but no friction occurs yet. Next the force on one side of the bollard is increased to a higher value (e.g., &lt;math&gt;F_\text{load} = 600\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;). This does cause frictional shear stresses in the contact area. In the final situation the bollard exercises a friction force. on the rope such that a static situation occurs.

The tension distribution in the rope in this final situation is described by the [[capstan equation]], with solution:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      T(\phi) &amp;= T_\text{hold},              &amp; \phi &amp;\in \left[\phi_\text{hold}, \phi_\text{intf}\right] \\
      T(\phi) &amp;= T_\text{load} e^{-\mu\phi}, &amp; \phi &amp;\in \left[\phi_\text{intf}, \phi_\text{load}\right] \\
  \phi_\text{intf} &amp;= \frac{1}{\mu} \log\left(\frac{T_\text{load}}{T_\text{hold}}\right) &amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The tension increases from &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hold}&lt;/math&gt; on the slack side (&lt;math&gt;\phi = \phi_\text{hold}&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;T_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt; on the high side &lt;math&gt;\phi = \phi_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt;. When viewed from the high side, the tension drops exponentially, until it reaches the lower load at &lt;math&gt;\phi = \phi_\text{intf}&lt;/math&gt;. From there on it is constant at this value. The transition point &lt;math&gt;\phi_\text{intf}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the ratio of the two loads and the friction coefficient. Here the tensions &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are in Newtons and the angles &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in radians.

The tension &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in the rope in the final situation is increased with respect to the initial state. Therefore, the rope is elongated a bit. This means that not all surface particles of the rope can have held their initial position on the bollard surface. During the loading process, the rope slipped a little bit along the bollard surface in the ''slip area'' &lt;math&gt;\phi \in [\phi_\text{intf}, \phi_\text{load}]&lt;/math&gt;. This slip is precisely large enough to get to the elongation that occurs in the final state. Note that there is no slipping going on in the final state; the term ''slip area'' refers to the slippage that occurred during the loading process. Note further that the location of the slip area depends on the initial state and the loading process. If the initial tension is &lt;math&gt;600\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; and the tension is reduced to &lt;math&gt;400\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; at the slack side, then the slip area occurs at the slack side of the contact area. For initial tensions between &lt;math&gt;400&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;600\,\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;, there can be slip areas on both sides with a stick area in between.

=== Generalization for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface ===
If a rope is laying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then three following conditions (all of them) are satisfied:

{{ordered list
| No separation – normal reaction &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is positive for all points of the rope curve:

: &lt;math&gt;N = -k_nT &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt; is a normal curvature of the rope curve.

| Dragging coefficient of friction &lt;math&gt;\mu_g&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following criteria for all points of the curve
:&lt;math&gt;-\mu_g &lt; \tan \alpha &lt; +\mu_g&lt;/math&gt;

| Limit values of the tangential forces:

The forces at both ends of the rope &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following inequality

: &lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\int_s \omega \mathrm{d}s} \le T \le T_0 e^{\int_s \omega \mathrm{d}s}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\omega = \mu_\tau \sqrt{ k_n^2 - \frac{k_g^2}{\mu_g^2} } = \mu_\tau k \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_g&lt;/math&gt;is a geodesic curvature of the rope curve, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a curvature of a rope curve, &lt;math&gt;\mu_\tau&lt;/math&gt;is a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction.

If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is constant then &lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}} \le T \le T_0 e^{\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

This generalization has been obtained by Konyukhov A.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konyukhov|first=Alexander|date=2015-04-01|title=Contact of ropes and orthotropic rough surfaces|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zamm.201300129/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics|language=en|volume=95|issue=4|pages=406–423|doi=10.1002/zamm.201300129|issn=1521-4001|bibcode=2015ZaMM...95..406K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111877065X,subjectCd-MA80.html|title=Introduction to Computational Contact Mechanics: A Geometrical Approach|last=Konyukhov A., Izi R.|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Wiley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sphere on a plane, the (3D) Cattaneo problem ===
Consider a sphere that is pressed onto a plane (half space) and then shifted over the plane's surface. If the sphere and plane are idealised as rigid bodies, then contact would occur in just a single point, and the sphere would not move until the tangential force that is applied reaches the maximum friction force. Then it starts sliding over the surface until the applied force is reduced again.

In reality, with elastic effects taken into consideration, the situation is much different. If an elastic sphere is pressed onto an elastic plane of the same material then both bodies deform, a circular contact area comes into being, and a (Hertzian) normal pressure distribution arises. The center of the sphere is moved down by a distance &lt;math&gt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt; called the ''approach'', which is equivalent to the maximum penetration of the undeformed surfaces. For a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and elastic constants &lt;math&gt;E, \nu&lt;/math&gt; this Hertzian solution reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_n(x, y) &amp;= p_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{r^2}{a^2}} &amp; 
    r &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \le a &amp; 
    a &amp;= \sqrt{R\delta_n} \\
  p_0 &amp;= \frac{2}{\pi} E^* \sqrt{\frac{\delta_n}{R}} &amp;   
    F_n &amp;= \frac{4}{3} E^* \sqrt{R} \delta_n^\frac{3}{2} &amp; 
    E^* &amp;= \frac{E}{2\left(1 - \nu^2\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider that a tangential force &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt; is applied that is lower than the Coulomb friction bound &lt;math&gt;\mu F_n&lt;/math&gt;. The center of the sphere will then be moved sideways by a small distance &lt;math&gt;\delta_x&lt;/math&gt; that is called the ''shift''. A static equilibrium is obtained in which elastic deformations occur as well as frictional shear stresses in the contact interface. In this case, if the tangential force is reduced then the elastic deformations and shear stresses reduce as well. The sphere largely shifts back to its original position, except for frictional losses that arise due to local slip in the contact patch.

This contact problem was solved approximately by Cattaneo using an analytical approach. The stress distribution in the equilibrium state consists of two parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_x(x, y) &amp;= \mu p_0 \left(\sqrt{1 - \frac{r^2}{a^2}} - \frac{c}{a}\sqrt{1 - \frac{r^2}{c^2}} \right) &amp;
    0 \le {} &amp;r \le c \\
  p_x(x, y) &amp;= \mu p_n(x, y) &amp; 
    c \le {} &amp;r \le a \\
  p_x(x, y) &amp;= 0 &amp;
    a \le {} &amp;r
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In the central, sticking region &lt;math&gt;0 \le r \le c&lt;/math&gt;, the surface particles of the plane displace over &lt;math&gt;u_x = \delta_x/2&lt;/math&gt; to the right whereas the surface particles of the sphere displace over &lt;math&gt;u_x = -\delta_x/2&lt;/math&gt; to the left. Even though the sphere as a whole moves over &lt;math&gt;\delta_x&lt;/math&gt; relative to the plane, these surface particles did not move relative to each other. In the outer annulus &lt;math&gt;c \le r \le r&lt;/math&gt;, the surface particles did move relative to each other. Their local shift is obtained as

:&lt;math&gt;s_x(x, y) = \delta_x + u_x^\text{sphere}(x, y) - u_x^\text{plane}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

This shift &lt;math&gt;s_x(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is precisely as large such that a static equilibrium is obtained with shear stresses at the traction bound in this so-called slip area.

So, during the tangential loading of the sphere, ''partial sliding'' occurs. The contact area is thus divided into a slip area where the surfaces move relative to each other and a stick area where they do not. In the equilibrium state no more sliding is going on.

== Solutions for dynamic sliding problems==
The solution of a contact problem consists of the state at the interface (where the contact is, division of the contact area into stick and slip zones, and the normal and shear stress distributions) plus the elastic field in the bodies' interiors. This solution depends on the history of the contact. This can be seen by extension of the Cattaneo problem described above.
* In the Cattaneo problem, the sphere is first pressed onto the plane and then shifted tangentially. This yields partial slip as described above.
* If the sphere is first shifted tangentially and then pressed onto the plane, then there is no tangential displacement difference between the opposing surfaces and consequently there is no tangential stress in the contact interface.
* If the approach in normal direction and tangential shift are increased simultaneously ("oblique compression") then a situation can be achieved with tangential stress but without local slip.&lt;ref name="Popov2010"/&gt;

This demonstrates that the state in the contact interface is not only dependent on the relative positions of the two bodies, but also on their motion history. Another example of this occurs if the sphere is shifted back to its original position. Initially there was no tangential stress in the contact interface. After the initial shift micro-slip has occurred. This micro-slip is not entirely undone by shifting back. So in the final situation tangential stresses remain in the interface, in what looks like an identical configuration as the original one.

== Solution of rolling contact problems==
[[File:Creep phenom.png|thumb|Rolling contact between a cylinder and a plane. Particles moving through the contact area from right to left, being strained more and more until local sliding sets in.]]

Rolling contact problems are dynamic problems in which the contacting bodies are continuously moving with respect to each other. A difference to dynamic sliding contact problems is that there is more variety in the state of different surface particles. Whereas the contact patch in a sliding problem continuously consists of more or less the same particles, in a rolling contact problem particles enter and leave the contact patch incessantly. Moreover, in a sliding problem the surface particles in the contact patch are all subjected to more or less the same tangential shift everywhere, whereas in a rolling problem the surface particles are stressed in rather different ways. They are free of stress when entering the contact patch, then stick to a particle of the opposing surface, are strained by the overall motion difference between the two bodies, until the local traction bound is exceeded and local slip sets in. This process is in different stages for different parts of the contact area.

If the overall motion of the bodies is constant, then an overall steady state may be attained. Here the state of each surface particle is varying in time, but the overall distribution can be constant. This is formalised by using a coordinate system that is moving along with the contact patch.

=== Cylinder rolling on a plane, the (2D) Carter-Fromm solution ===
Consider a cylinder that is rolling over a plane (half-space) under steady conditions, with a time-independent longitudinal creepage &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. (Relatively) far away from the ends of the cylinders a situation of [[plane strain]] occurs and the problem is 2-dimensional.

If the cylinder and plane consist of the same materials then the normal contact problem is unaffected by the shear stress. The contact area is a strip &lt;math&gt;x \in [-a, a]&lt;/math&gt;, and the pressure is described by the (2D) Hertz solution.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_n(x) &amp;= \frac{p_0}{a} \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} &amp; 
    |x| &amp;\le a &amp; 
    a^2 &amp;= \frac{4 F_n R}{\pi E^*} \\
  p_0 &amp;= \frac{2 F_n}{\pi a} &amp;&amp;&amp;
    E^* &amp;= \frac{E}{2\left(1 - \nu^2\right)} &amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution of the shear stress is described by the Carter-Fromm solution. It consists of an adhesion area at the leading edge of the contact area and a slip area at the trailing edge. The length of the adhesion area is denoted &lt;math&gt;2a'&lt;/math&gt;. Further the adhesion coordinate is introduced by &lt;math&gt;x' = x + a - a'&lt;/math&gt;. In case of a positive force &lt;math&gt;F_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (negative creepage &lt;math&gt;\xi &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_x(x) &amp;= 0 &amp;
    |&amp;x| \ge a \\
  p_x(x) &amp;= \frac{\mu p_0}{a} \left( \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} - \sqrt{a'^2 - x'^2} \right) &amp;
    a - 2a' \le {} &amp;x \le a \\
  p_x(x) &amp;= \mu p_n(x) &amp; 
    &amp;x \le a - 2a'
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The size of the adhesion area depends on the creepage, the wheel radius and the friction coefficient.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     a' &amp;= a \sqrt{1 - \frac{|F_x|}{\mu F_n}}, &amp;
                \mbox{for } |F_x| \le \mu F_n \\
    \xi &amp;= -\operatorname{sign}(F_x) \, \frac{\mu (a - a')}{R}, &amp;
                \mbox{i.e. } |\xi| \le \frac{\mu a}{R} \\
    F_x &amp;= -\operatorname{sign}(\xi) \,\mu F_n \left( 1 - \left( 1 + \frac{R |\xi|}{\mu a}\right)^2 \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For larger creepages &lt;math&gt;a' = 0&lt;/math&gt; such that full sliding occurs.

== Half-space based approaches==
When considering contact problems at the intermediate spatial scales, the small-scale material inhomogeneities and surface roughness are ignored. The bodies are considered as consisting of smooth surfaces and homogeneous materials. A continuum approach is taken where the stresses, strains and displacements are described by (piecewise) continuous functions.

The [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] approach is an elegant solution strategy for so-called "smooth-edged" or "concentrated" contact problems.
# If a massive elastic body is loaded on a small section of its surface, then the elastic stresses attenuate proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/distance^2&lt;/math&gt; and the elastic displacements by &lt;math&gt;1/distance&lt;/math&gt; when one moves away from this surface area.
# If a body has no sharp corners in or near the contact region, then its response to a surface load may be approximated well by the response of an elastic half-space (e.g. all points &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)^\mathsf{T} \in \R^3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;).
# The elastic half-space problem is solved analytically, see the [[Linear elasticity#Solutions for elastostatic cases|Boussinesq-Cerruti solution]].
# Due to the linearity of this approach, multiple partial solutions may be super-imposed.
Using the fundamental solution for the half-space, the full 3D contact problem is reduced to a 2D problem for the bodies' bounding surfaces.

A further simplification occurs if the two bodies are “geometrically and elastically alike”. In general, stress inside a body in one direction induces displacements in perpendicular directions too. Consequently, there is an interaction between the normal stress and tangential displacements in the contact problem, and an interaction between the tangential stress and normal displacements. But if the normal stress in the contact interface induces the same tangential displacements in both contacting bodies, then there is no relative tangential displacement of the two surfaces. In that case, the normal and tangential contact problems are decoupled. If this is the case then the two bodies are called ''quasi-identical''. This happens for instance if the bodies are mirror-symmetric with respect to the contact plane and have the same elastic constants.

Classical solutions based on the half-space approach are:
# Hertz solved the contact problem in the absence of friction, for a simple geometry (curved surfaces with constant radii of curvature).
# Carter considered the rolling contact between a cylinder and a plane, as described above. A complete analytical solution is provided for the tangential traction.
# Cattaneo considered the compression and shifting of two spheres, as described above. Note that this analytical solution is approximate. In reality small tangential tractions &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt; occur which are ignored.

'''Genetic assimilation''' is a process by which a phenotype originally produced in response to an environmental condition, such as exposure to a [[teratogen]], later becomes genetically encoded via [[artificial selection]] or [[natural selection]]. Despite superficial appearances, this does not require the ([[Lamarckian]]) [[inheritance of acquired characters]], although [[epigenetic inheritance]] could potentially influence the result.&lt;ref name="Pocheville 2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Pocheville | first1=Arnaud | last2=Danchin | first2=Etienne | editor1-last=Huneman | editor1-first=Philippe | editor2-last=Walsh | editor2-first=Denis | title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=January 1, 2017 | pages= | chapter=Chapter 3: Genetic assimilation and the paradox of blind variation | chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/21713421/Genetic_assimilation_and_the_paradox_of_blind_variation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic assimilation overcomes the barrier to selection imposed by genetic [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalization]] of developmental pathways.

Waddington]], in which ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit fly embryos were exposed to ether, producing a [[bithorax]]-like phenotype (a [[homeotic]] change). Flies which developed [[haltere]]s (the modified hindwings of [[true flies]], used for balance) with wing-like characteristics were chosen for breeding for 20 generations, by which point the phenotype could be seen without ether treatment.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book | author=Gilbert, Scott F. | authorlink=Scott F.

==History==
===Waddington's experiments===
[[File:Drosophile normale et cross-veinless.jpg|thumb| Normal and cross-veinless ''[[Drosophila]]'' wings]]

[[C. H. Waddington|Conrad H. Waddington]]'s classic experiment (1942) induced an extreme environmental reaction in the developing embryos of ''[[Drosophila]]''. In response to [[ether]] vapor, a proportion of embryos developed a radical [[phenotype|phenotypic]] change, a second [[thorax]]. At this point in the experiment ''bithorax'' is not innate; it is induced by an unusual environment. Waddington then repeatedly selected ''Drosophila'' for the ''bithorax'' phenotype over some 20 generations. After this time, some ''Drosophila'' developed ''bithorax'' without the ether treatment.&lt;ref name=Waddington1942&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington, C. H. |authorlink=Conrad Hal Waddington |date=1942 |title=Canalization of development and the inheritance of acquired characters |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=150 |pages=563–565 |doi=10.1038/150563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington carried out a similar experiment in 1953, this time inducing the ''cross-veinless'' [[phenocopy]] in ''Drosophila'' with a heat shock, with 40% of the flies showing the phenotype prior to selection. Again he selected for the phenotype over several generations, applying heat shock each time, and eventually the phenotype appeared even without heat shock.&lt;ref name="Waddington1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waddington |first1=C.

===Waddington's explanation===

Waddington called the effect he had seen genetic assimilation. His explanation was that it was caused by a process he called [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalization]]. He compared [[embryonic development]] to a ball rolling down a slope in what he called an epigenetic landscape, where each point on the landscape is a possible state of the organism (involving many variables). As a particular pathway becomes entrenched or canalized, it becomes more stable, likely to occur even in the face of environmental changes. Major perturbations such as ether or heat shock eject the developmental pathway from the [[metaphor]]ical canal, exploring other parts of the epigenetic landscape. Selection in the presence of that perturbation leads to the evolution of a new canal; after the perturbation is discontinued, the new canal continues to attract developmental trajectories.&lt;ref name="Masel"/&gt;

===A Darwinian explanation===

Other biologists have agreed that assimilation occurs, but give a different, purely [[quantitative genetics]] explanation in terms of [[natural selection|natural]] or [[artificial selection]]. The [[phenotype]], say ''cross-veinless'', is presumed to be caused by a combination of multiple genes. The phenotype appears when the sum of [[Quantitative genetics#Gene effects|gene effects]] exceeds a [[threshold model|threshold]] that is lower with the perturbation than without. Continued selection under perturbation conditions increases the frequency of the alleles of genes that promote the phenotype until the higher threshold is breached, and the phenotype appears without requiring the heat shock.&lt;ref name="Masel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Falconer | first1=D. S. | last2=Mackay | first2=Trudy F. C. | title=Introduction to quantitative genetics | date=1998 | publisher=Longman | isbn=0-582-24302-5 | pages=309–310 | edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbations can be genetic or epigenetic rather than environmental. For example, ''Drosophila'' fruit flies have a heat shock protein, [[Hsp90]], which protects the development of many structures in the adult fly from heat shock. If the protein is damaged by a mutation, then just as if it were damaged by the environmental effects of drugs, many different phenotypic variants appear; if these are selected for, they quickly establish without further need for the mutant Hsp90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutherford, S. L.; Lindquist, S. |title=Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=1998 |volume=396 |pages=336–342 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6709/full/396336a0.html |doi=10.1038/24550 |pmid=9845070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington's theory of genetic assimilation was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1658254/Science_Politics_or_Lamarckism_C._H._Waddingtons_alternative_approach_to_Darwinism Science, Politics or Lamarckism?

Adam S. Wilkins wrote that "[Waddington] in his lifetime... was widely perceived primarily as a critic of Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. His criticisms ... were focused on what he saw as unrealistic, 'atomistic' models of both gene selection and trait evolution." In particular, according to Wilkins, Waddington felt that the Neo-Darwinians badly neglected the phenomenon of extensive gene interactions and that the 'randomness' of mutational effects, posited in the theory, was false.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2008"&gt;Wilkins, Adam S. (2008). ''Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now''. Biological Theory 3: 224-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Waddington became critical of the neo-Darwinian synthetic theory of evolution, he still described himself as a Darwinian, and called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] based on his research.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington's epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?'' BioEssays 34: 149-157.&lt;/ref&gt; Waddington did not deny the threshold-based conventional genetic interpretation of his experiments, but regarded it "as a "told to the children" version of what I wished to say" and considered the debate to be about "mode of expression, rather than of substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Waddington | first1=C. H. | title=Comment on Professor Stern's Letter | journal=The American Naturalist | date=1 November 1958 | volume=92 | issue=867 | pages=375–376 | doi=10.1086/282049 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/282049 | issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to adaptation==
Mathematical modeling suggests that under certain circumstances, natural selection favours the evolution of canalization that is designed to fail under extreme conditions.&lt;ref name="Eshel98"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eshel, I.; Matessi, C. | title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation.

In the 1960s Waddington and J. M. Rendel argued for the importance of genetic assimilation in natural adaptation as a means of providing new and potentially beneficial variation to populations under stress, enabling them to evolve rapidly. Their contemporary [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] argued that genetic assimilation proceeds at the cost of a loss of previously adaptive [[developmental plasticity]], and therefore should be seen as resulting in a net loss rather than gain of complexity, making it uninteresting from the perspective of the constructive process of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=George Christopher |authorlink=George Christopher Williams |title=Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWZEq87CqO0C&amp;pg=PP71 |year=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-2010-3 |pages=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the preceding [[phenotypic plasticity]] need not be adaptive, but simply represent a breakdown of [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]].&lt;ref name="Eshel98" /&gt;

== In natural populations==
[[File:Chappell Island tiger snake.jpg|thumb|''[[Notechis scutatus]]'' tiger snakes from islands, like this one from Chappell Island, have larger heads than mainland populations, apparently genetically assimilated.&lt;ref name=AubretShine2009/&gt;]]

Several instances of genetic assimilation have been documented contributing to natural selection in the wild. For example, populations of the island tiger snakes (''[[Notechis scutatus]]'') have become isolated on islands and have larger heads to cope with large prey animals. Young populations have larger heads by phenotypic plasticity, whereas large heads have become genetically assimilated in older populations.&lt;ref name=AubretShine2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aubret, F.; Shine, R. |date=2009 |title=Genetic assimilation and the postcolonisation erosion of phenotypic plasticity in island Tiger snakes |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |pages=1932–1936 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.061 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(09)01775-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, patterns of left-right asymmetry or "handedness", when present, can be determined either genetically or plastically. During evolution, genetically determined directional asymmetry can arise either from a nonheritable (phenotypic) developmental process, or directly by [[mutation (biology)|mutation]] from a symmetric ancestor. An excess of transitions from plastically determined to genetically determined handedness points to the role of genetic assimilation in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=A. Richard |title=Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development |journal=Science |date=2004 |volume=306|issue=5697 |pages=828–833 |doi=10.1126/science.1103707 |pmid=15514148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third example has been seen in [[yeast]]. Evolutionary events in which [[stop codon]]s are lost  preserve the [[reading frame]] much more often than would be expected from mutation bias. This finding is consistent with the role of the [[Fungal prion|yeast prion]] [PSI+] in epigenetically facilitating stop codon readthrough, followed by genetic assimilation via the permanent loss of the stop codon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giacomelli |first1=M.

'''Glassblowing''' is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten [[glass]] into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a '''glassblower''', '''glassmith''', or '''gaffer'''. A '''[[lampworking|lampworker]]''' (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of [[borosilicate glass]].

==Technology==

===Principles===
As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the [[1st century BC]], glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology. Academic Press: London. {{ISBN|0-12-265620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone"&gt;Freestone, I. (1991). "Looking into Glass". In S. Bowman (ed.) ''Science and the Past''. pp.37–56. University of Toronto Press: Toronto &amp; Buffalo. {{ISBN|0-7141-2071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollard"&gt;Pollard, A.M. and C. Heron 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CT_FWEfanCIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Archaeological Chemistry]. The Royal Society of Chemistry {{ISBN|0-85404-262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;Cummings, K. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm387Ui_DEAC&amp;printsec=frontcover A History of Glassforming]. University of Pennsylvania Press {{ISBN|0812236475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from [[Sepphoris]] of Israel, Fischer and McCray&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0398|title=Glass Production Activities as Practiced at Sepphoris, Israel (37 ?–? 1516)|year=1999|last1=Fischer|first1=A|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|pages=893|issue=8|last2=McGray|first2=W.Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulated that the concentration of [[natron]], which acts as [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.

During blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.

A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.

====Free-blowing====
[[File:Glassblowing demo at Norcal Ren Faire 2010-09-19 20.JPG|alt=Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010|thumb|Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010]]
This method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mariacher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariacher|first1=G|title=Glass: from Antiquity to the Renaissance|date=1970|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=Middlesex}} (apparently out of print)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerwick"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chloe Zerwick|author2=Corning Museum of Glass|title=A short history of glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ZQAAAAMAAJ|date=May 1990|publisher=H.N. Abrams in association with the Corning Museum of Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art attempted to reconstruct the ancient free-blowing technique by using clay blowpipes. The result proved that short clay blowpipes of about {{convert|30|–|60|cm|abbr=on}} facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birgit Schlick-Nolte|author2=E. Marianne|title=Early glass of the ancient world: 1600 B.C.-A.D. 50 : Ernesto Wolf collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJUsAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=clay+blowpipe|year=1994|publisher=[[Gerd Hatje|Verlag Gerd Hatje]]|isbn=978-3-7757-0502-8|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling the temperature of the piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.

An outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the [[Portland Vase]], which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudenrath |first1=W. |last2=Whitehouse |first2=D. |year=1990 |title= The Manufacture of the Vase of its Ancient Repair |journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume= 32 |pages= 108–121 |jstor=24188035}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.

====Mold-blowing====
[[File:Bamboo Framing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassblower [[Jean-Pierre Canlis]] sculpting a section of his piece "Insignificance"]]
Mold-blowing was an alternative glassblowing method that came after the invention of free-blowing, during the first part of the second quarter of the [[1st century AD]].&lt;ref name="Lightfoot"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lightfoot, C.S.|year= 1987|title= A Group of early Roman Mould-Blown Flasks from the West|journal= Journal of Glass Studies |volume=29|pages= 11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pricea"&gt;Price, J. (1991). "Decorated Mould-Blown Glass Tablewares in the First century AD". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 56–75. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;

Two types of molds, namely single-piece mold and multi-piece mold, are frequently used to produce mold-blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation.&lt;ref name="Tattona"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "The Roman Empire". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 62–97. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting the development of more sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.

The Roman leaf beaker which is now on display in the J. Paul Getty Museum was blown in a three-part mold decorated with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wright, K.|year= 2000|title= Leaf Beakers and Roman Mould-blown Glass Production in the First Century AD|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=42|pages= 61–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Taylor and Hill&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, M. &amp; D. Hill 1998. Making Roman Glass Today. In The Colchester Archaeologist 11&lt;/ref&gt; tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal, in particular bronze, molds are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster molds and wooden molds.

The development of the mold-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuneaz"&gt;Cuneaz, G.

The transformation of raw materials into glass takes place around {{convert|2400|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NJBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=glass+at+2,400+%C2%BAF+white+hot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jp2zDacTFp&amp;sig=_YDd_WvTydE_gY9mNTl3EatB8Mk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu57OEj_DTAhVL4mMKHRsVDL4Q6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20at%202,400%20%C2%BAF%20white%20hot&amp;f=false|title=Purchasing Agent: Magazine of Centralized Buying|date=1919-01-01|publisher=Purchasing agent Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the glass emits enough heat to appear almost white hot. The glass is then left to "fine out" (allowing the [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around {{convert|2000|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between {{convert|1600|and|1900|°F|°C|order=flip}}, "soda-lime" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable as low as {{convert|1350|°F|°C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Annealing is usually done between {{convert|700|and|900|°F|°C|order=flip}}.

{{anchor|glory hole|lehr|annealer}}
Glassblowing involves three [[furnace]]s. The first, which contains a [[crucible]] of molten glass, is simply referred to as '''the furnace'''. The second is called the '''glory hole''', and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the '''lehr''' or '''annealer''', and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to [[thermal stress]]. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.

{{anchor|punty|pontil|blowpipe|marver}}
The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.

The tip of the '''[[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]''' is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is "gathered" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous [[honey]] is picked up on a [[honey dipper]]. This glass is then rolled on the '''[[marver]]''', which was traditionally a flat slab of [[marble]], but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of [[steel]]. This process, called marvering,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153111/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/269.html Marvering]. glassonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]] rod called a punty  for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.

The '''bench''' is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. '''Blocks''' are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked [[fruitwood]], and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation.  In similar fashion, pads of '''water-soaked newspaper''' (roughly {{cvt|6|in|cm|order=flip}} square, {{convert|0.5|to|1|in|cm|order=flip}} thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.  '''Jacks''' are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. '''Paddles''' are flat pieces of wood or [[graphite]] used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. '''Tweezers''' are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. '''Straight shears''' are essentially bulky [[scissors]], used for making linear cuts. '''Diamond shears''' have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.

There are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called [[frit]]. Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of [[caneworking|cane]] (rods of colored glass) and [[murrine]] (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then "picked up" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is "reticello", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.

A [[lampworking|lampworker]], usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used [[alcohol]] lamps and breath or [[bellows]]-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as [[laboratory glassware]], beads, and durable scientific "specimens"—miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by [[Hans Godo Frabel]] (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of [[oxygen]] and [[propane]] or [[natural gas]]. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the [[borosilicate glass]] (low-expansion) of the [[scientific glassblowing|scientific glassblower]]. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]s to help form the glass or [[fused quartz]] used for special projects.

==History==

===Origins===

The earliest evidence of glassblowing was found by [[Roman Ghirshman]] in [[Chogha Zanbil]], where many glass bottles were found in the excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Sève, L (2012). Ghirshman, Roman. Encyclopaedia Iranica Vol. X, Fasc. 6, pp. 583-586&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;شیشه‌گری (In Persian: Glassblowing) [[:fa:شیشه‌گری]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a [[mikvah]], a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of [[Jerusalem]], dated from 37 to 4 BC.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avigad"&gt;Avigad, N (1983). ''Discovering Jerusalem''. Nashville. {{ISBN|0-8407-5299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.&lt;ref name="Gudnerath"/&gt;

Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass.&lt;ref name="Israeli"&gt;Israeli, Y. (1991). "The Invention of Blowing". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention''. pp. 46–55. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass.

===Roman Empire===

[[File:Glassworking and glassblowing.jpg|thumb|upright|Glassblowing production methods in England in 1858]]

The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century BC, which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"&gt;Vose, R.H. (1989). ''Glass''. Collins Archaeology: London. {{ISBN|0-85223-714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassblowing was greatly supported by the Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of [[Augustus]]), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isings"&gt;Isings, C. 1957. Roman Glass: from dated finds. Archaeologica Traiectina. J.B. Wolters: Groningen.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first large glass workshops were set up by the [[Phoenicians]] in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]] as well as in the neighbouring province of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

[[Ennion]] for example, was among one of the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mold-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs.&lt;ref name="Pricea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horicht"&gt;Hőricht, L.A.S. (1991). "Syrian Elements among the Glass from Pompeii". In M. Newby &amp; K. Painter (eds.) ''Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention''. pp. 76–85. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London {{ISBN|0-85431-255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the glassblowing technique reached [[Egypt]] and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on [[papyrus]] which was dated to 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coles"&gt;Coles, R.A. 1983. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri 50. Egypt Exploration Society for the British Academy: London.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of [[Samothrace]] and at [[Corinth]] in mainland [[Greece]] which were dated to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;

Later, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire, first in [[Italy]] by the middle of the 1st century AD. [[Rome]], the heartland of the Empire, soon became a major glassblowing center, and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example [[Campania]], [[Morgantina]] and [[Aquileia]].&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grose, D.F.|year=1982|title=The Hellenistic and Early Roman Glass from Morgantina (Serra Orlando), Sicily|journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume=24|page=s 20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from [[unguentaria]] (toiletry containers for [[perfume]]) to [[cameo (carving)|cameo]], from [[tableware]] to [[window]] glass, were produced.

From there, escaping craftsmen (who had been forbidden to travel) otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the [[Alps]] (which is now [[Switzerland]]), and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day [[France]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, D. (1998). "Roman Glass in Britain". ''Shire Archaeology'' No. 76. CTT Printing Series Ltd.: Pembrokeshire.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priceb"&gt;Price, J. (2000). "Roman Glass Production in Western Europe". In M-D Nenna (ed.) ''La Route Du Verre: ateliers primaries et secondaires du second millenaire av. J-C au Moyen Age''. pp. 123–124. Maison de l’Orient Mediterranean: Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in [[Cologne]] on the river [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]] by late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and [[terracotta]] base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption and the application of mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Besides, blown [[flagon]]s and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops.&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vosea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example [[bottle]]s with a handle, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at [[Poetovio]] and [[Celeia]] in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Lazar"&gt;Lazar, I. 2006. Glass finds in Slovenia and neighbouring areas. In Journal of Roman Archaeology 19: 299–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving physical evidence, such as blowpipes and molds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at [[Avenches]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] of [[Spain]], as well as in [[Salona]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Tattona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques.&lt;ref name="Tattonb"&gt;Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). "Early Medieval Europe AD 400 – 1066". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 98–111. British Museum Press: London. {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voseb"&gt;Vose, R.H. (1989). "From Dark Ages to the Fall of Constantinople". In D. Klein &amp; W. Lloyd (eds.) ''The History of Glass''. pp. 39–66. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blown glass objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape of the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The [[Byzantine]] glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] symbols in [[Jerusalem]] between late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tait"/&gt; Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at [[Samarra]] in the Islamic lands.&lt;ref name="Voseb"/&gt;

[[Renaissance]] Europe witnessed the revitalization of glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the [[Venice|Venetian]] glassworkers from [[Murano]] to produce the fine glassware which is also known as [[cristallo]].&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;Tait, H. (1994). "Europe from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution". In H. Tait (ed.) ''Five Thousand Years of Glass''. pp. 145–187. British Museum Press: London {{ISBN|0-8122-1888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Wood, P. (1989). "The Tradition from Medieval to Renaissance". In D. Klein &amp; W. Lloyd (eds.) ''The History of Glass''. pp. 67–92. Macdonald &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd.: {{ISBN|0-85613-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for [[window]] panes in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="Cummings"/&gt; The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown in many parts of the world, for example, in [[China]], [[Japan]] and the Islamic Lands.

The Nøstetangen Museum at [[Hokksund]], [[Norway]] shows how glass was made according to ancient tradition. The Nøstetangenglassworks had operated there from 1741 to 1777, producing  table-glass and chandeliers in the German and English style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/ ''Nøstetangen Glassworks'' (Nøstetangen)]. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 ''Gamle Sorenskrivergaarden'' (Nøstetangen)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192422/http://nostetangenmuseum.no/?page_id=14 |date=2012-03-24 }}. nostetangenmuseum.no&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

===Recent developments===
The "[[studio glass movement]]" began in 1962 when [[Harvey Littleton]], a ceramics professor, and [[Dominick Labino]], a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], during which they started experimenting with melting glass in a small [[furnace]] and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios([http://www.handblownglass.com/Modern-Hand-Blown-Glass]). This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Dante Marioni]], Fritz Driesbach and [[Marvin Lipofsky]] as well as scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.

Working with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex [[choreography]] of precisely timed movements.  This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups.

===In literature===
The writer [[Daphne du Maurier]] was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 [[historical novel]] ''The Glass-Blowers''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382723.The_Glass_Blowers&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of mystery novelist [[Donna Leon]]'s ''Through a Glass, Darkly'' is the investigation of a crime in a Venetian glassworks on the island of Murano.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/donna-leon/through-a-glass-darkly/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gluten is a [[protein complex]] that accounts for 75–85% of the total protein in bread wheat.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref name="cgc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/fact-fait/gluten-eng.htm |title=Gluten's role in bread baking performance |publisher=Canadian Grain Commission |publication-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In home or restaurant cooking, gluten is prepared from [[flour]] by kneading the flour under water, agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network known as a [[dough]], and then washing out the [[starch]].&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt; Starch granules [[suspension (chemistry)|disperse]] in low-temperature water, and the dispersed starch is [[sedimentation|sedimented]] and dried. If a [[salt|saline]] solution is used instead of water, a purer protein is obtained, with certain harmless [[impurity|impurities]] departing the solution with the starch. Where starch is the prime product, cold water is the favored solvent because the impurities depart from the gluten.

In industrial production, a [[slurry]] of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass.&lt;ref name="sakhare"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4252461|year=2013|author1=Sakhare|first1=S.

About 65% of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a [[screw press]]; the remainder is sprayed through an [[atomizer nozzle]] into a [[drying]] chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature for a short time to allow the water to evaporate without denaturing the gluten.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is [[Air cooling|air cooled]] and [[Pneumatics|pneumatically]] transported to a receiving vessel.

===Bread products===

Gluten forms when [[glutenin]] molecules cross-link via [[disulfide bond]]s to form a submicroscopic network attached to [[gliadin]], which contributes [[viscosity]] (thickness) and extensibility to the mix.&lt;ref name="shewry1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692935|year=2002|author1=Shewry|first1=P.

Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the [[staling]] of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.&lt;ref&gt;

Further refining of the gluten leads to chewier doughs such as those found in [[pizza]] and [[bagel]]s, while less refining yields tender baked goods such as [[pastry]] products.&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, [[bread]] flours are high in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. [[Kneading]] promotes the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (as opposed to more brittle or crumbly). The "chewiness" increases as the dough is kneaded for longer times. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development,&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"/&gt; and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading (see [[no-knead bread]]). [[Shortening]] inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a [[pie crust]], is desired.

The strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a [[farinograph]]. This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours when developing recipes for various baked goods.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/simsek/wheat/farinograph.html |title=Farinograph |date=22 September 2014 |website=Wheat Quality and Carbohydrate Research |publisher=North Dakota State University |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliver |first=JR |last2=Allen |first2=HM |date=January 1992 |title=The prediction of bread baking performance using the farinograph and extensograph |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521009800581 |journal=Journal of Cereal Science |publisher=Elsevier |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=79–89 |doi=10.1016/S0733-5210(09)80058-1 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Added gluten====

Gluten, when dried, milled and added to ordinary [[flour]] dough, may help improve the dough's ability to increase in volume. The resulting mixture also increases the bread's structural stability and chewiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Amendola, J.|author2= Rees, N.|author3= Lundberg, D. E.|year=2002|title=Understanding Baking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluten-added dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity; an automatic [[bread machine]] or [[food processor]] may be required for high-gluten kneading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eckhardt, L.W.|author2=Butts, D.C.|year=1997|title=Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, higher gluten levels are associated with higher overall protein content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain|title=Against the Grain|date=3 November 2014|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imitation meats===
[[File:Wheat gluten (vegetarian mock duck) 2007.jpg|thumb|Gluten is often used in imitation meats (such as this mock "duck") to provide supplemental protein and variety in vegetarian diets]]
{{details|topic=the use of gluten in cooking|Wheat gluten (food)}}

Gluten, especially [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], is often the basis for [[Meat analogue|imitation meats]] resembling [[beef]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]] (see [[mock duck]]), [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[pork]]. When cooked in [[broth]], gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid (including the flavor) and becomes firm to the bite.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Dorothy, R.; Wingate, Colby. 1993. "Cooking with Gluten and Seitan." Summertown, Tennessee: The Book Publishing Co. 128 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegannomnoms.net/2011/03/how-to-make-seitan-an-illustrated-guide.html |title=How to Make Seitan: An Illustrated Guide |last=Abramowski |first=Nicole |date=11 March 2011 |website=Vegan Nom Noms |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of gluten is a popular means of adding supplemental protein and variety to many [[vegetarian]] diets.

===Other consumer products===

Gluten is often present in [[beer]] and [[soy sauce]], and can be used as a [[food additive|stabilizing agent]] in more unexpected food products, such as [[ice cream]] and [[ketchup]]. Foods of this kind may therefore present problems for a small number of consumers because the hidden gluten constitutes a hazard for people with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] and gluten sensitivities. The protein content of some [[pet food]]s may also be enhanced by adding gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Wheat allergy===
{{Main article|Wheat allergy}}

People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a [[wheat allergy]].&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi /&gt; As with most allergies, a wheat allergy causes the immune system to abnormally respond to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body. This immune response is often time-limited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cureceliacdisease.org/archives/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-gluten-intolerance-gluten-sensitivity-and-wheat-allergy|publisher=The University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center|title=What’s the difference between celiac disease, gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy?|date=2015|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders.&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/allergyfactsheettwo.pdf |title=Food intolerance and coeliac disease |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=September 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012 /&gt;

===Gluten ataxia===
[[File:Gluten ataxia eng.ogg|thumb|Gluten ataxia eng|A male with gluten ataxia: previous situation and evolution after three months of gluten-free diet]]

[[Ataxia#Gluten ataxia|Gluten ataxia]] is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten.&lt;ref name="sapone-etal-2010-b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sapone A, Bai JC, Ciacci C, Dolinsek J, Green PH, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Rostami K, Sanders DS, Schumann M, Ullrich R, Villalta D, Volta U, Catassi C, Fasano A | title = Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 10 | issue =  | pages = 13 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22313950 | pmc = 3292448 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-10-13 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing, with loss of [[Purkinje cell]]s. People with gluten ataxia usually present [[gait abnormality]] or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs. Gaze-evoked [[nystagmus]] and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common. [[Myoclonus]], palatal tremor, and [[opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome|opsoclonus-myoclonus]] may also appear.&lt;ref name="HadjivassiliouSanders2015" /&gt;

Early diagnosis and treatment with a [[gluten-free diet]] can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of [[Purkinje cells|neurons in the cerebellum]] as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible.&lt;ref name="HadjivassiliouSanders2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitomaAdhikari2016"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Mitoma H, Adhikari K, Aeschlimann D, Chattopadhyay P, Hadjivassiliou M, Hampe CS et al.| title=Consensus Paper: Neuroimmune Mechanisms of Cerebellar Ataxias | journal=Cerebellum | year= 2016 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 213–32 | pmid=25823827 | doi=10.1007/s12311-015-0664-x | pmc=4591117 | type=Review }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeling==

===International standards===

The ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' [[international standard]]s for [[food labeling]] has a standard relating to the labeling of products as "[[gluten-free]]". It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.org/download/standards/291/cxs_118e.pdf|publisher=[[Codex Alimentarius]]|title=Codex Standard For "Gluten-Free Foods" CODEX STAN 118-1981|date=February 22, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

By law in Brazil, all food products must display labels clearly indicating whether or not they contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://e-legis.anvisa.gov.br/leisref/public/showAct.php?id=32
  |date=July 2014
  |title=General labeling for Packaged Foods (free translation)
  |publisher=[[ANVISA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The Canadian Celiac Association estimates that one in 133 Canadians experiences adverse symptoms from gluten in celiac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celiac.ca/?page_id=882|title=About celiac disease|date=2014|publisher=Canadian Celiac Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/allerg/cel-coe/gluten-position-eng.php|title=Health Canada's Position on Gluten-Free Claims|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

In the European Union, all prepackaged foods and non-prepacked foods from a restaurant, take-out food wrapped just before sale, or unpackaged food served in institutions must be identified if gluten-free.&lt;ref name="fsa2016"&gt;{{cite web
  |url= https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide/labelling-of-gluten-free-foods
  |date=31 October 2016
  | title=Labelling of 'gluten free' foods
  | publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gluten-free" is defined as 20 parts per million of gluten or less and "very low gluten" is 100 parts per million of gluten or less; only foods with cereal ingredients processed to remove gluten can claim "very low gluten" on labels.&lt;ref name=fsa2016/&gt;

All foods containing gluten as an ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognised EU allergens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.food.gov.uk/science/allergy-intolerance/label/labelling-changes|title=EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation (EU FIC) |date=March 2016|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|format=link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, gluten is not listed on labels unless added as a standalone ingredient. Wheat or other allergens are listed after the ingredient line. The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has historically classified gluten as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). In August 2013, the FDA issued a final ruling, effective August 2014, that defined the term "gluten-free" for voluntary use in the labeling of foods as meaning that the amount of gluten contained in the food is below 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm362880.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|title=Questions and Answers: Gluten-Free Food Labeling Final Rule|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wind power]] has been growing in the United States since the 1970s.{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}}

==History==
The growth of [[wind power in the United States]] has been enhanced by a [[Tax credit#Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC)|production tax credit]] (PTC), which pays 2.3¢/kWh for the first 10 years. Development has been off and on again due to the expiration and late renewal of the PTC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-tax-credit-ptc Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC)]&lt;/ref&gt; It expired at the end of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/17/dead-air-end-to-tax-credits-takes-big-bite-out-of-wind-power Dead Air: End of Tax Credit Deflates Wind Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=121 United States]&lt;/ref&gt; only to be restored in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1386834/Update-US-Senate-approves-one-year-wind-PTC-extension Update: US Senate approves one-year wind PTC extension]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was renewed but is phased out over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewables-boom-expected-thanks-to-tax-credit/ Renewables Boom Expected Thanks to Tax Credit]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals set by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] is to increase the number of states which have over 1,000 MW of wind power to 15 by 2018. By the end of 2015 there were 17. Another goal was to increase the number of states with at least 100 MW to 30 by 2010. As of 2011, there are 29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/mission.html Mission, Vision, and Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 vision for wind calls for 10% generation by wind by 2020 (113 GW), 30% by 2030 (224 GW), and 35% by 2050 (404 GW). It calls for 40 states to each have at least 1 GW, and wind power in all 50 states. Larger wind turbines has expanded the commercial viability of wind to all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/wind/maps/wind-vision Wind Vision: A New Era for Wind Power in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts expect 25 GW more between 2016-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmissionhub.com/articles/2016/03/while-investment-may-slow-in-coming-years-plenty-of-transmission-construction-investment-happening.html |title=While investment may slow in coming years, plenty of transmission construction, investment happening |author=Corina Rivera Linares |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530102813/http://www.transmissionhub.com/articles/2016/03/while-investment-may-slow-in-coming-years-plenty-of-transmission-construction-investment-happening.html |archive-date=30 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hebron Glass''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;زجاج الخليل&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''zajaj al-Khalili'' ) refers to [[glass]] produced in [[Hebron]] as part of a flourishing [[Palestinian art|art]] industry established in the city during [[History of Palestine#Roman Period 63 BCE–330 CE|Roman rule]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;Spaulding and Welch, 1994, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; Hebron's Old City still contains a quarter named the "Glass-Blower Quarter" and Hebron glass continues to serve as a tourist attraction for the city.

Traditionally, the glass was melted using local raw materials, including [[sand]] from neighbouring villages, [[sodium carbonate]] (from the [[Dead Sea]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dphjewelry.com/art-n0809-131.html |title=Hebron Beads |publisher=Dphjewelry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coloring additives such as [[iron oxide]] and [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]]. Nowadays, [[Glass recycling|recycled glass]] is often used instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets of which have been preserved and passed down by a few [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city.&lt;ref name=HolyLand&gt;{{cite web|title=Vases|publisher=Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society|url=http://www.holyland-handicraft.org/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=53&amp;Itemid=1&amp;TreeId=48&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=1|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; The products made include glass [[jewellery]], such as [[Glass beadmaking|beads]], bracelets, and rings,&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;Beard, 1862, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[stained glass]] windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the [[Middle East conflict#Arab-Israeli conflict|Palestinian-Israeli conflict]], glass production has suffered a decline.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==History==
The glass industry in Hebron was established during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE).&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; As the ancient [[Phoenicia]]n glass industry shrank from the exposed cities along the eastern [[Mediterranean]] coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, Chipiez and Armstrong, 1885, p.328.&lt;/ref&gt; Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit as part of the Drake Collection.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the [[Cave of Machpelah]], which served as a [[Church (building)|church]] during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Comay&gt;Comay, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the [[Dome of the Rock]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

"Hebron’s medieval reputation in glassmaking is corroborated by some of the many Christian pilgrims who visited the city over the centuries. Between 1345 and 1350, Franciscan monk [[Niccolò da Poggibonsi]] noted that “they make great works of art in glass.” In the late 15th century, the German friar [[Felix Faber]] and his companions also stopped in this “exceeding ancient city,” and he described how “we came forth from our inn, and passed through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but more particularly workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colors between dark and light.”&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Gail. 2013. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201301/hebron.s.glass.history.htm "Hebron's Glass History."] Saudi Aramco World. January/February 2013. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that the production of glass in Palestine dates back to Roman period, Nazmi Ju'beh, director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', contends that the practices of today's glass industry in Hebron most likely emerged in the 13th century CE.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; This corresponds to what foreigners  observed, like [[Jacques de Vitry]] who around 1080 mentioned Acre and Tyre, (but not Hebron), as glass-producing cities,&lt;ref&gt;Vitry, 1896, p. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028534422#page/n105/mode/2up 92-93]&lt;/ref&gt; while by 1483, when [[Felix Fabri]] visited the city, he described passing "through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but particularely  workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colours between dark and light."&lt;ref&gt;Fabri, 1893, p. [https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti02paleuoft#page/411/mode/1up 411]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ju'beh notes that an alternate theory assigns today's techniques to the [[Venetian glass]] tradition and that still other researchers claim they were already extant at the time of the [[Crusades]] and were carried back to [[Europe]] from Hebron, possibly originating in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; 
[[File:Road to Hebron, Mar Saba, etc. Glass works.jpg|thumb|left|Glass Works, photo taken 1900-1920 by [[American Colony, Jerusalem]].]]
Glass produced by these factories were typically functional items including drinking and eating vessels, as well as olive oil and later [[petrol]]-based lamps, although the factories also produced jewellery and accessories.  [[Bedouins]] of the [[Negev]] (Naqab), the [[Arabian Desert]], and [[Sinai]] were the primary purchasers of jewellery, but large exports of expensive Hebron glass items were sent by guarded [[Camel train|camel caravans]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, and the [[Jordan|Transjordan]]. Marketing communities of Hebron glass were established in [[Al Karak|al-Karak]] (Crac) in southern [[Jordan]] and [[Cairo]] in Egypt by the 16th century.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

The glass industry was a principal employer and a generator of wealth for its owners.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; Well known for glass production throughout the [[Arab world]], [[Western culture|Western]] travellers to Palestine in the 18th and 19th century provided descriptions of the Hebron glass industry as well. For example, [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney|Volney]] in the 1780s, wrote that: "They make there great quantity of coloured rings, bracelets for the wrists and legs, and for the arm above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref&gt;Volney, 1788, vol II, p. [https://archive.org/stream/travelsthroughs00volngoog#page/n343/mode/1up  325]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1807-09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;Seetzen, 1855, vol. 3, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/ulrichjaspersee02seetgoog#page/n14/mode/1up 5]-6. Schölch, 1993, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; while later, in ''A New and Complete History of the Holy Bible as Contained in the Old and New Testaments'' (1844), Robert Sears writes, "The population of Hebron is considerable: the inhabitants manufacture glass lamps, which are exported to Egypt. Provisions are abundant, and there is a considerable number of shops."&lt;ref name=Sears&gt;Sears, 1844, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the production declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling [[Jew]]ish traders from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Delpuget, David: ''Les Juifs d´Alexandrie, de Jaffa et de Jérusalem en 1865'', Bordeaux, 1866, p. 26. Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|World Fair of 1873 in Vienna]], Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 [[franc]]s per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of glassblowing continues in the 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of [[Halhul]] which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of the factories are owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

Hebron glass is an attraction for both domestic and foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on [[Palestinian freedom of movement]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Intifada]], industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Modern Hebron Glass Factory.jpg|thumb|left|Carefully moving molten glass as part of the modern production process]]

Hebron glass was traditionally produced using sand from the village of [[Bani Na'im]], east of Hebron, and [[sodium carbonate]] taken from the [[Dead Sea]]. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.&lt;ref name=IMEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Hebron glass: A centuries' old tradition|author=Nazmi al-Ju'bah|publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]] (Original in ''This Week in Palestine'')|date=January 25, 2008|url=http://imeu.net/news/article007701.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise production process is a trade secret maintained by the few Palestinian families who run the factories which continue to produce Hebron glass today,&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; passed through generations by [[apprenticeship|apprenticing]] children. As one master of the craft said, "You can learn to play the [['oud]] at any age, but unless you begin [glasswork] as a child, you will never become a master."&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the [[Glassblowing|blowing]] technique employed is the same as was used by the ancient [[Phoenicians]],&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a ''kammasha'' is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thompson++holy+land#PRA5-PA584,M1 Thompson], 1861, p.584.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewellery==
[[File:Costumes, characters, etc. Native jewellery -i.e., jewelry- shop..jpg|thumb|The jewellery store shows [[evil eye]] beads and Hebron-made glass bracelets sold alongside the shopkeeper's main ware of silver or metal wire.&lt;ref name=Weirp192&gt;Weir, 1989, pp. 192, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Photo taken 1900-1920 by [[American Colony, Jerusalem]].]]

Glass beads for jewellery have traditionally been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (''owayneh'') were made for use as [[amulets]] since they were considered particularly effective against the [[evil eye|evil-eye]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weirp194&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 194. See also [http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&amp;cid=498&amp;did=959&amp;pageflip=2 Palestinian Jewellery]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Museum|Museum of Mankind]] collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate period]] or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a [[Hamsa]], representing the hand of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Weirp201&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in [[Bayt Dajan]], a glass bracelet (''ghwayshat'') made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's [[Dowry|trousseau]].&lt;ref name=Weirp230&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebron trade beads===
In 1799, [[England|English]] traveller [[William George Browne]] mentioned the production of "Coarse glass beads...called Hersh and Munjir" in Palestine; The "Munjir" (''Mongur'') were large beads, while the Hersh (''Harish'') were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, William G. (1799): ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria from the Years 1792 to 1796''. Cadell, Davis, Longman, and Rees, London. Page 303. As cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt; These Hebron glass beads were used for [[trade beads|trade]], and export primarily to [[Africa]] from the early to mid-19th century. Spread throughout [[West Africa]], in [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], they were grounded on the edges to make round beads fit together on a strand more suitably. There, they picked up the name "Kano Beads", although they were not originally produced in Kano. By the 1930s, their value had decreased; in 1937, [[A. J. Arkell]] recorded the beads being sold "for a song" by [[Sudan]]ese women to [[Hausa people|Hausa]] traders in [[Dafur]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, A. J. (1937) ''Hebron Beads in [[Darfur|Durfur]]'', Sudan Notes and Records 20(2):300-305, as cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">In computer science, '''hub labels''' or the '''hub-labelling algorithm''' is a method that consumes much fewer resources than the [[lookup table]] but is still extremely fast for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « A Hub-Based Labeling Algorithm for Shortest Paths on Road Networks »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « Hierarchical Hub Labelings for Shortest Paths »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method allows at the most with two SELECT statements and the analysis of two strings to compute the shortest path between two vertices of a graph.
For a graph that is oriented like a road graph, this technique requires the prior computation of two tables from structures constructed using the method of the [[contraction hierarchies]]. 
In the end, these two computed tables will have as many rows as nodes present within the graph. For each row (each node), a label will be calculated.

A label is a string containing the distance information between the current node (the node of the row) and all the other nodes that can be reached with an ascending search on the relative multi-level structure. The advantage of these distances is that they all represent the shortest paths. 

So, for future queries, the search of a shortest path will start from the source on the first table and the destination on the second table, from which it will be search within the labels for the common nodes with the associated distance information. Only the smallest sum of distances will be kept as the shortest path result.

The '''International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences''' ('''IUAES''') is the largest world forum of [[anthropologist]]s and [[Ethnology|ethnologists]], with members from more than fifty countries. Every five years, in different parts of the world, the IUAES sponsors a major Congress (ICAES/World Congress), gathering researchers from all of the various subfields and branches of anthropology. The IUAES was founded under the auspices of [[UNESCO]] in 1948. The International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (ICAES) had been separately founded in [[London]] in 1934. The two organizations united in 1948, and merged officially in 1968. In 2018, IUAES became one of the chambers of the newly established World Anthropological Union (WAU). The main objective of the IUAES is the internationalization of anthropology, and the cross-cultural honing and public dissemination of anthropological research perspectives.

== History ==

The earliest  predecessor of the IUAES was the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, which was founded in [[La Spezia]], Italy, in 1865. In 1932, in [[Basel|Basle]], Switzerland, it was decided to split the congress into two sections, one for the Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences and one for the [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] and [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] [[Science]]s. This is how the ICAES was born, becoming operative in 1934, when it held its first meeting in [[London]], UK. Meetings were scheduled for every four years, but only one more congress was held, in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 1938, before World War II made it impossible for people to convene. It took ten years before the next congress was held, in 1948, in [[Brusel|Brussels]], Belgium. Here a special committee was established to be concerned solely with anthropological interests and this became the IUAES. It was formed under the aegis of [[UNESCO]] and became a member of the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies ([[ICPHS]]), which it remains to this day. 

The four-year congress cycle continued with meetings in [[Vienna]] (1952), [[Philadelphia]] (1956), [[Paris]] (1960) and [[Moscow]] (1964). Up to this point the IUAES remained separate from the ICAES, and was presided over by different people until Henri Vallois took over both presidencies in 1956. Just four years prior to this, in 1952, the International Social Science Council ([[ISSC]]) was founded and the IUAES has been represented in it ever since. By 1964, at the ICAES in Moscow, it was decided that the two organizations be joined de facto. At the following congress, in [[Tokyo]] (1968), they were united de jure. At the same congress, it was also decided to change the time interval between congresses from four to five years, scheduling the following congress for 1973 in [[Chicago]]. At the subsequent congress, held in [[New Delhi]], India, in 1978, it was proposed to organize inter-congresses. These smaller meetings enable countries which do not have the resources to hold a large-scale congress to participate actively. IUAES Inter-Congresses are held with varied frequency in the five-year interval between congresses. To ensure the financial autonomy of the Union from its congresses, in 1998 it was decided to again separate the presidency of the IUAES from that of each succeeding ICAES. The ICAES scheduled for 2008 in Kunming, China, had to be postponed by one year, and was held in 2009 as the IUAES World Congress. The next World Congress was held in [[Manchester]], UK, in 2013.

== Structure ==
 
The IUAES has an administrative structure involving three bodies: the General Assembly, the Permanent Council, and the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the main regulatory body, making policy decisions on behalf of, and subject to the authority of, the Permanent Council. The Permanent Council consists of national delegations empowered to vote on any matters concerning the Union. The votes may follow discussions held at the General Assembly. The latter can also put forward proposals but has no decision-making authority. All policy decisions are implemented by the Executive Committee. The structural guidelines of the IUAES are given in its Statutes, which have grown from a simple set of rules into an array of constitutional by-laws.   

The core officers of the IUAES Executive Committee are the President, the Secretary-General and the Treasurer, with the Secretary-General maintaining all records of the Union and supervising all communications, including the production and dissemination of new IUAES publications (including Newsletters and Handbooks), as well as the designing and updating of the IUAES website. The current Secretary-General is [[Noel B. Salazar]]. The rest of the Executive Committee, that is, the past-president, the vice-presidents (with the president of the following congress acting as an additional vice-president) and the members-at-large, aid in the decision-making process. 

The scientific work of the IUAES is carried out by its Commissions, which focus on particular topics of specialized interest. The IUAES Commissions, of which more than thirty are currently recognized, (Nas and Zhang 2009:460-461),&lt;ref&gt;Nas, Peter J. M. and Zhang Jijiao, eds. (2009) ''Anthropology Now''. Beijing: Intellectual Property Rights Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; determine their own administrative structure and set of activities, which generally include the organization of panels, workshops, and sessions at the quinquennial ICAES. Some commissions have been in existence for decades, while others have rapidly disbanded. Some commissions have their own websites, organize their own conferences, and sponsor the publication of journals or book series. Groups of commissions sometimes co-sponsor initiatives of common interest, and it is possible for IUAES members to be involved in the work of multiple commissions.

== Mission ==

As stated in Article 3 of its Statutes, posted on the IUAES website, the objectives of the Union are:
* To develop international scientific and professional co-operation (consistent with the Charter of UNESCO) in the fields of anthropology and ethnology, in the broadest sense in which these are understood in different parts of the world, and related disciplines and areas of study; 
* To foster the development of scientific and professional institutions internationally and regionally; 
* To stimulate scientific and professional co-operation among institutions devoted to relevant fields of knowledge; 
* To co-operate with other international organizations, and particularly, though not exclusively, with the [[International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies]], the [[International Social Science Council]], the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]], and the [[International Council of Museums]]; 
* To develop appropriate roles for anthropology and ethnology in international inter-disciplinary scientific endeavors; 
* To take appropriate steps to meet any other objectives consistent with the international scientific and professional concerns of the membership, as determined by the Permanent Council and the Executive Committee.

Reaching these objectives requires the internationalization of anthropological practice through cross-cultural exchanges based on inclusive, democratic, and intellectually pluralistic policies. These needs were formally acknowledged under the leadership of  Cyril S. Belshaw, president in the period 1978-1983, who sensed that "the mood is to place the Union on an active footing" (Belshaw, 1979: 244).&lt;ref&gt;Belshaw, Cyril S. (1979) "Message from the President" ''Current Anthropology'' 20(1):244-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES Congresses and Inter-Congresses catalyze this process, which is also facilitated by the development and maintenance of efficient channels of membership-wide communication. Initially, news about the IUAES was disseminated through ''Current Anthropology'', the journal of the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation]], which also supported the IUAES. Starting in 1981, however, Dr. [[Eric Sunderland]]—the longest serving and one of the most influential, and beloved, IUAES Secretary-Generals—introduced a Newsletter, which he continued to edit and distribute until he moved from his post to become President of the IUAES. Dr. Peter J. M. Nas, who became the next Secretary-General, continued and expanded the publication of the Newsletter, and also developed an official website ([http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/iuaes]), which rapidly became the central point of contact for the Union.

The Williamsburg Congress of 1998 marked the end of a century of anthropology by highlighting that: "No discipline is more important for teaching people about themselves and others, and how they may live together in the next century, than anthropology" (Shahshahani, 1999:5).&lt;ref&gt;Shahshahani, Soheila (1999) "ICAES, Williamsburg 1998" International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences Newsletter 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also pointed out that:"Anthropology is either truly international or not at all"(Godina, 1999:vii).&lt;ref&gt;Godina, Vesna (1999) "Foreword" in  ''Anthropological Theory in North America''. E. L. Cerroni-Long, ed., Westport, CT, Bergin &amp; Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt; The IUAES, which celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding in 2008, enters the second decade of the 21st century with a renewed sense of the importance of its mission, and urgency of its objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''''Into the Open''''', subtitled "New Paintings, Prints and Sculptures by Contemporary Black Artists", was an exhibition of art by black artists displayed at various venues in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984.

This exhibition was the first major survey by a municipal gallery of contemporary work by [[black artists]] in Britain, and is considered one of the landmark exhibitions of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dYDoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22into+the+open%22+exhibition+black+artists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI4PjDjrXdxwIVh9gaCh2mewRj#v=onepage&amp;q=%22into%20the%20open%22%20exhibition%20black%20artists&amp;f=false ''Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s''], I.B. Tauris, 2014, p. 113. {{ISBN|1780762720}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was curated, at the invitation of [[Sheffield City Arts Department]], by two people closely involved with black artists in Britain: [[Pogus Caesar]] and [[Lubaina Himid]].  Their stated aim was to give an indication of the range and richness of art made by contemporary [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro Caribbean]] artists.

The ''Into the Open'' exhibition toured in the United Kingdom in 1984, appearing at three venues: the [[Mappin Art Gallery]] in [[Sheffield]] (4 August–9 September 1984), the [[Nottingham Castle#Nottingham Castle Museum|Castle Museum]] in [[Nottingham]] (16 September–21 October 1984), and the [[Newcastle Media Workshops]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] (2–24 November 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (2014), note 20, pp. 255–56.&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized by the Sheffield Arts Department and was subsidised by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].

'''Kirklington Hall Research Station''' was a [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical]] research institute of [[BP]] in [[Kirklington, Nottinghamshire]].

==History==
As part of the [[East Midlands Oil Province]], oil was found in eastern Nottinghamshire. It was also known as the '''BP Research Centre''' or the Geophysical Centre, part of BP's Exploration Division. The research centre was established in 1950. Its first employee was [[Jack Birks]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1338608/Jack-Birks.html Jack Birks]&lt;/ref&gt; later Managing Director of BP. From 1950 it was the main research site of BP, until BP sold the site in 1957 for £12,000. Research moved to [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], in [[Surrey]], in 1957. Sunbury had been built around the same time as the Kirklington site, in the early 1950s.

Kirklington Hall today is a private school.

==Structure==
The former site is situated north of the [[A617 road|A617]].

==Function==
It conducted [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research for [[Hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] for BP. This part of BP is now known as [[BP Exploration]]. Work would be conducted on [[core sample]]s and with [[Reflection seismology|seismic methods]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">The '''LogP machine''' is a model for [[parallel computation]].&lt;ref&gt;Culler et al. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
It aims at being more practical than the [[Parallel random-access machine |PRAM]] model while still allowing for easy analysis of computation.
The name is not related to the [[Logarithm|mathematical logarithmic function]]:  Instead, the machine is described by the four parameters &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

The LogP machine consists of arbitrarily many processing units with [[distributed memory]].
The processing units are connected through an abstract communication medium which allows point-to-point communication. This model is pair-wise synchronous and overall asynchronous.

The machine is described by the four parameters:

* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the communication medium.
* &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] of sending and receiving a message.
* &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, the gap required between two send/receive operations. A more common interpretation of this quantity is as the inverse of the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of a processor-processor communication channel.
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the number of processing units.  Each local operation on each machine takes the same time ('unit time').  This time is called a processor cycle.

The units of the parameters &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are measured in multiples of processor cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8698">The [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] '''MIND Institute''' (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) research and treatment center affiliated with the [[University of California, Davis]], with facilities located on the [[UC Davis School of Medicine|UC Davis Medical Center]] campus in [[Sacramento, California]]. The institute is a consortium of scientists, educators, physicians and parents dedicated to researching the causes of and treatments for [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[fragile X syndrome]], and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

==Origins==

Parents of [[autism|autistic]] children led the drive to raise funds for the cause, anticipating the institute could become the premiere [[autism]] research institute in the world. Among the parents behind the institute are Chuck and [[Sarah Gardner]], whose son Chas has been diagnosed with autism. Chuck is a Sacramento area building contractor and co-founder of the institute along with his wife, Sarah, a television anchorwoman for Sacramento (KCRA 3).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The institute's largest contribution came from the [[California State Legislature]], which provided $34 million to the institute for autism research. The efforts enabled construction of the institute's facility at the UC Davis Medical Center campus in Sacramento. After the major funding from the State, [[Rick Rollens]], the former Secretary of the California State Senate and one of the leaders in the effort to create the institute, said the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) was funding genetic-oriented research into autism, and that the MIND Institute was created by parents demanding that scientists look at other causes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Interdisciplinary research teams==

The MIND Institute brings together experts in fields as diverse as [[molecular genetics]] and clinical [[pediatrics]], using a [[multidisciplinary]] approach to treating and finding cures for [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.

[[David Amaral|David G. Amaral]], PhD, is the research director of the MIND Institute and a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Neuroscience, a [[neuroscientist]] who studies the organization of memory systems in the brain. [[Sally J. Rogers]], Ph.D. is a specialist in [[developmental psychology]] and professor of [[psychiatry]] and [[behavior]] science for the institute. [[Jacqueline Crawley]], PhD is a [[Behavioral neuroscience|behavioral neuroscientist]] and an expert on rodent behavioral analysis and the director of [http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/centers/iddrc/cores/rodent_behavior.html IDDRC Rodent Behavior Core in MIND Institute].

==Fragile X and Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome==

MIND institute has a major focus on studying neurodevelopmental disorders caused by genetic instability e.g. Fragile-X syndrome. [[Randi J. Hagerman]], M.D. and Paul J. Hagerman, M.D., Ph.D. have been studying genotype-phenotype correlations in fragile X and potential discovery of targeted treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hagerman, Randi Jenssen, and Paul J. Hagerman. Fragile X syndrome: Diagnosis, treatment, and research. Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagerman, Randi J., et al. "Intention tremor, parkinsonism, and generalized brain atrophy in male carriers of fragile X." Neurology 57.1 (2001): 127-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence study==

In October 2002, the institute released a study appearing to confirm that the prevalence of autism has risen steeply. The study was led by Dr. Robert Byrd, whose team gathered information on 684 children with [[developmental disabilities]] from [[California]]'s Department of Developmental Services regional centers.  Byrd's team's reported autism was on the rise in California, and that some of the increase was real and could not be explained by artificial factors such as misclassification and diagnostic criteria changes, nor by migration of children into California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byrd RS, Sage AC, Keyzer J, etal |publisher=[[M.I.N.D. Institute]] |title=Report to the legislature on the principal findings of the epidemiology of autism in California: a comprehensive pilot study |date=2002 |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/newsroom/study_final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414094255/http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/newsroom/study_final.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-14 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 analysis found that special education data poorly measured prevalence because so many cases were undiagnosed, and that the 1994–2003 U.S. increase was associated with declines in other diagnostic categories, indicating that diagnostic substitution had occurred in the U.S. overall (though not in California in particular).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2006 |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1028–37 |title=The contribution of diagnostic substitution to the growing administrative prevalence of autism in US special education |author=Shattuck PT |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1516 |pmid=16585296 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/4/1028 |laysummary=http://www.news.wisc.edu/12368 |laydate=2006-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current consensus is that the rise in the number of autism cases is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |year=2007 |volume=28 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17367287 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024137/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though as-yet-unidentified contributing environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Rutter M |title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal=Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study published in 2009 found that the seven- to eight-fold increase in the number children born in California with autism since 1990 cannot be explained by either changes in diagnosis or counting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/134717.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in the January 2009 issue of Epidemiology, results also suggest that research should shift from genetics to the host of chemicals and infectious microbes in the environment that are likely at the root of changes in the neurodevelopment of California's children.

==Autism Phenome Project==

In 2006, the MIND Institute launched its Autism Phenome Project, with the objective of identifying biological and behavioral patterns in order to define distinct [[autism spectrum]] subtypes.  According to Amaral, "The tremendous variation in autism leads us to believe that it is a group of disorders rather than a single one."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite press release |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071107_medicine_autism/index.html |title=Getting closer to finding the culprits |publisher=UC Davis Health System |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longitudinal study will enroll 1800 children, aged two to four: 900 diagnosed with autism, 450 with developmental delays, and 450 [[neurotypical]] control subjects.  The study will involve systematic analyses of immune systems, brain structures, genetics, environmental exposures and blood proteins and other developmental indicators, and the medical evaluations will continue for several years.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

A '''manuscript''' (abbreviated '''MS''' for singular and '''MSS''' for plural) was, traditionally, any document that is written by hand -- or, once practical [[typewriter]]s became available, [[typewritten]] -- as opposed to being mechanically [[printing|printed]] or reproduced in some indirect or automated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manuscript|title=Definition of MANUSCRIPT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include ''any'' written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author's work, as distinguished from its rendition as a printed version of the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of [[printing]], all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations. Manuscripts may be in book form, [[scroll (parchment)|scrolls]] or in [[codex]] format. [[Illuminated manuscript]]s are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations.

Before the invention of [[woodblock printing]] in China or by [[moveable type]] in a [[printing press]] in Europe, all written documents had to be both produced and reproduced by hand. Historically, manuscripts were produced in form of scrolls (''volumen'' in Latin) or books (''codex'', plural ''codices''). Manuscripts were produced on [[vellum]] and other parchment, on [[papyrus]], and on paper. In Russia [[birch bark document]]s as old as from the 11th century have survived. In India, the [[palm leaf manuscript]], with a distinctive long rectangular shape, was used from ancient times until the 19th century. [[Paper]] spread from China via the Islamic world to Europe by the 14th century, and by the late 15th century had largely replaced parchment for many purposes.

When Greek or Latin works were published, numerous professional copies were made simultaneously by scribes in a [[scriptorium]], each making a single copy from an original that was declaimed aloud.

The oldest written manuscripts have been preserved by the perfect dryness of their Middle Eastern resting places, whether placed within [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in Egyptian tombs, or reused as [[mummy]]-wrappings, discarded in the [[midden]]s of [[Oxyrhynchus]] or secreted for safe-keeping in jars and buried ([[Nag Hammadi library]]) or stored in dry caves ([[Dead Sea scrolls]]). Manuscripts in [[Tocharian languages]], written on palm leaves, survived in desert burials in the [[Tarim Basin]] of Central Asia. Volcanic ash preserved some of the Roman library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]].

Ironically, the manuscripts that were being most carefully preserved in the libraries of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] are virtually all lost. Papyrus has a life of at most a century or two in relatively moist Italian or Greek conditions; only those works copied onto parchment, usually after the general conversion to Christianity, have survived, and by no means all of those.

Originally, all books were in manuscript form. In China, and later other parts of East Asia, [[woodblock printing]] was used for books from about the 7th century. The earliest dated example is the [[Diamond Sutra]] of 868. In the Islamic world and the West, all books were in manuscript until the introduction of movable type printing in about 1450. Manuscript copying of books continued for a least a century, as printing remained expensive. Private or government documents remained hand-written until the invention of the typewriter in the late 19th century. Because of the likelihood of errors being introduced each time a manuscript was copied, the [[Stemmatics|filiation]] of different versions of the same text is a fundamental part of the study and criticism of all texts that have been transmitted in manuscript.

In [[Southeast Asia]], in the first millennium, documents of sufficiently great importance were inscribed on soft metallic sheets such as [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], softened by refiner's fire and inscribed with a metal stylus. In the [[Philippines]], for example, as early as 900AD, specimen documents were not inscribed by stylus, but were punched much like the style of today's [[dot-matrix printer]]s. This type of document was rare compared to the usual leaves and bamboo staves that were inscribed. However, neither the leaves nor paper were as durable as the metal document in the hot, humid climate. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], the kammavaca, Buddhist manuscripts, were inscribed on brass, copper or ivory sheets, and even on discarded monk robes folded and lacquered. In [[Italy]] some important [[Etruria|Etruscan]] texts were similarly inscribed on thin gold plates: similar sheets have been discovered in [[Bulgaria]]. Technically, these are all inscriptions rather than manuscripts.

The study of the writing, or "hand" in surviving manuscripts is termed [[palaeography]]. In the Western world, from the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] through the early centuries of the [[Christian era]], manuscripts were written without spaces between the words ([[scriptio continua]]), which makes them especially hard for the untrained to read. Extant copies of these early manuscripts written in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] and usually dating from the 4th century to the 8th century, are classified according to their use of either all [[majuscule|upper case]] or all [[lower case|lower case letters]]. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts, such as the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] make no such differentiation. Manuscripts using all upper case letters are called [[majuscule]], those using all lower case are called [[lower case|minuscule]]. Usually, the majuscule scripts such as [[uncial]] are written with much more care. The scribe lifted his pen between each stroke, producing an unmistakable effect of regularity and formality. On the other hand, while minuscule scripts can be written with pen-lift, they may also be [[cursive]], that is, use little or no pen-lift.

==Modern variations==
In the context of [[library science]], a manuscript is defined as any hand-written item in the collections of a library or an archive. For example, a library's collection of hand-written letters or diaries is considered a manuscript collection. Such manuscript collections are described in finding aids, similar to an index or table of contents to the collection, in accordance with national and international content standards such as [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard|DACS]] and [[ISAD(G)]].

In other contexts, however, the use of the term "manuscript" no longer necessarily means something that is hand-written. By analogy a ''typescript'' has been produced on a typewriter.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/typescript |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In book, magazine, and music publishing, a manuscript is an original copy of a work written by an author or composer, which generally follows standardized typographic and formatting rules. (The staff paper commonly used for handwritten music is, for this reason, often called "manuscript paper"). In film and theatre, a manuscript, or ''script'' for short, is an author's or dramatist's text, used by a theatre company or film crew during the production of the work's performance or filming. More specifically, a motion picture manuscript is called a screenplay; a television manuscript, a teleplay; a manuscript for the theatre, a stage play; and a manuscript for audio-only performance is often called a radio play, even when the recorded performance is disseminated via non-radio means.

In insurance, a manuscript policy is one that is negotiated between the insurer and the policyholder, as opposed to an off-the-shelf form supplied by the insurer.

==European manuscript history==
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}
[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|left|After plummeting in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[High Middle Ages|high]] and [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval period]] witnessed a sharp increase of manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buringh|first1=Eltjo|last2=Van Zanden|first2=Jan Luiten|title=Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=409–445|doi=10.1017/s0022050709000837}} (see p. 416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most surviving pre-modern manuscripts use the codex format (as in a modern book), which had replaced the scroll by [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Parchment]] or [[vellum]], as the best type of parchment is known, had also replaced [[papyrus]], which was not nearly so long lived and has survived to the present only in the extremely dry conditions of [[Egypt]], although it was widely used across the Roman world. Parchment is made of animal skin, normally calf, sheep, and/or goat, but also other animals. With all skins, the quality of the finished product is based on how much preparation and skill was put into turning the skin into parchment. Parchment made from calf or sheep was the most common in Northern Europe, while civilizations in Southern Europe preferred goatskin.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, if the parchment is white or cream in color and veins from the animal can still be seen, it is calfskin. If it is yellow, greasy or in some cases shiny, then it was made from sheepskin.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Vellum comes from the [[Latin]] word vitulinum which means “of calf”/ “made from calf”. For modern parchment makers and calligraphers, and apparently often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term "membrane" is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Because they are books, pre-modern manuscripts are best described using bibliographic rather than archival standards. The standard endorsed by the American Library Association is known as AMREMM.&lt;ref name="AMREMM"&gt;Pass, Gregory. Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts. Chicago: Association of College and Research Libraries, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing digital catalog of pre-modern manuscripts is [[Digital Scriptorium]], hosted by the University of California at Berkeley.

==A sample of common genres of manuscripts==
From ancient texts to medieval maps, anything written down for study would have been done with manuscripts. Some of the most common genres were bibles, religious commentaries, philosophy, law and government texts.

===Bibles===
“[[The Bible]] was the most studied book of the Middle Ages.”&lt;ref name="beryl"&gt;Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages. 3rd ed. (Oxford, 1983), xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bible was the center of medieval religious life. Along with the Bible came scores of commentaries. Commentaries were written in volumes, with some focusing on just single pages of scripture. Across Europe, there were universities that prided themselves on their biblical knowledge. Along with universities, certain cities also had their own celebrities of biblical knowledge during the medieval period.

===Book of hours===
[[File:Pentecost 01.jpg|thumb|The Pentecost, from an illuminated Catholic [[liturgical]] manuscript, c.1310-1320]]
A [[book of hours]] is a type of devotional text which was widely popular during the Middle Ages. They are the most common type of surviving medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]]. Each book of hours contain a similar collection of texts, [[Christian prayer|prayers]], and [[Psalms (Christian)|psalms]] but decoration can vary between each and each example. Many have minimal illumination, often restricted to ornamented [[initials]], but books of hours made for wealthier patrons can be extremely extravagant with full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]. These books were used for owners to recite prayers privately eight different times, or hours, of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalbooksofhours.com/learn#basic|title=Book of Hours Tutorial|last=|first=|date=|website=Les Enluminures|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical books and calendars===
Along with Bibles, large numbers of manuscripts made in the Middle Ages were revieved in Church{{clarification needed|reason=received? revived? reviewed?|date=August 2016}}. Due to the complex church system of rituals and worship these books were the most elegantly written and finely decorated of all medieval manuscripts. Liturgical books usually came in two varieties. Those used during mass and those for divine office.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;

Most liturgical books came with a calendar in the front. This served as a quick reference point for important dates in Jesus' life and to tell church officials which saints were to be honored and on what day. The format of the liturgical calendar was as follows:

Almost all medieval calendars give each day's date according to the Roman method of reckoning time. In the Roman system, each month had three fixed points known as Kalends (Kal), the Nons and the Ides. The Nones fell on the fifth of the month in January, February, April, June, August, September, November and December, but on the seventh of the month in March, May, July and October. The Ides fell on the thirteenth in those months in which the Nones fell on the fifth, and the fifteenth in the other four months. All other days were dated by the number of days by which they preceded one of those fixed points.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt;&lt;!--pg.195--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Pickering, The Calendar Pages of Medieval Service Books: An Introductory Note for Art Historians (Reading, UK., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scripts==
[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]] Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]
[[Merovingian script]], or "Luxeuil minuscule", is named after an abbey in Western France, the [[Abbey of Luxeuil|Luxeuil Abbey]], founded by the Irish missionary St [[Columba]] ca. 590.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michelle P. ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts''. Toronto, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michelle P. ''A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600''. Toronto,1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline minuscule]] is a [[Calligraphy|calligraphic script]] developed as a writing standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] could be easily recognized by the literate class from different regions. It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 and 1200. Codices, classical and Christian texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into blackletter and became obsolete, though its revival in the Italian renaissance forms the basis of more recent scripts.&lt;ref name = "Intro" /&gt; In ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', Clemens and Graham associate the beginning of this text coming from the Abby of Saint-Martin at [[Tours]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

Caroline Minuscule arrived in England in the second half of the 10th century. Its adoption there, replacing Insular script, was encouraged by the importation of continental European manuscripts by Saints Dunstan, Aethelwold, and Oswald. This script spread quite rapidly, being employed in many English centres for copying Latin texts. English scribes adapted the Carolingian script, giving it proportion and legibility. This new revision of the Caroline Minuscule was called English Protogothic Bookhand.
Another script that is derived from the Caroline Minuscule was the German Protogothic Bookhand. It originated in southern Germany during the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="“script"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. "English Protogothic Bookhand." In Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;
All the individual letters are Caroline; but just as with English Protogothic Bookhand it evolved. This can be seen most notably in the arm of the letter h. It has a hairline that tapers out by curving to the left. When first read the German Protogothic h looks like the German Protogothic b.&lt;ref name="manu" &gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. "German Protogothic Bookhand." In Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Many more scripts sprang out of the German Protogothic Bookhand. After those came Bastard Anglicana, which is best described as:
lipi = pandu lipi pura lipi vignayani
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The coexistence in the Gothic period of formal hands employed for the copying of books and cursive scripts used for documentary purposes eventually resulted in cross-fertilization between these two fundamentally different writing styles. Notably, scribes began to upgrade some of the cursive scripts. A script that has been thus formalized is known as a ''bastard'' script (whereas a bookhand that has had cursive elements fused onto it is known as a hybrid script). The advantage of such a script was that it could be written more quickly than a pure bookhand; it thus recommended itself to scribes in a period when demand for books was increasing and authors were tending to write longer texts. In England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, many books were written in the script known as Bastard Anglicana.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;!--pg.164--&gt;

'''Merovingian art''' is the art of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the 5th century to the 8th century in present-day [[France]], [[Benelux]] and a part of [[Germany]].
The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] in the 5th century led to important changes in the field of arts.  Sculpture regressed to be little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]] and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, [[goldsmith|gold work]] and the new medium of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] integrated "barbarian" [[Migration Period art|animal-style]] decoration, with [[Late Antique]] motifs, and other contributions from as far as Syria or Ireland to constitute  Merovingian art.

==Architecture==
The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465 &amp;ndash; 511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church.  Plans often continued the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]] tradition, but also took influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia.  In the East, most structures were in timber, but stone was more common for significant buildings in the West and in the southern areas that later fell under Merovingian rule.  Most major churches have been rebuilt, usually more than once, but many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology.  The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460-490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A feature of the basilica of Saint-Martin that became a hallmark of Frankish church architecture was the sarcophagus or reliquary of the saint raised to be visible and sited axially behind the altar, sometimes in the [[apse]].  There are no Roman precedents for this Frankish innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Jacobsen, "Saints' Tombs in Frankish Church Architecture" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:1107-1143).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Peter's church, Vienne (Isère)|Saint Peter's church]] in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] is the only surviving one. A number of other buildings, now lost, including the Merovingian foundations of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St. Gereon]] in [[Cologne]], and the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris, are described as similarly ornate.

Some small buildings remain, especially [[Baptistery|baptistries]], which fell out of fashion and were spared rebuilding.  In [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Riez]] and [[Fréjus]], three octagonal [[baptistery|baptistries]], each covered with a cupola on pillars, are testimony to the influence of oriental architecture (the baptistry of Riez, in the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], recalls that of St.&amp;nbsp;George, Ezra', [[Syria]]). Very different from these Provençal baptistries, except for the quatrefoil one of [[Venasque]], that of [[Baptistère Saint-Jean|St.&amp;nbsp;Jean]] at [[Poitiers]] (6th century) has the form of a rectangle flanked by three apses. The original building has probably undergone a number of alterations but preserves in its decoration (marble capitals) a Merovingian character.

Among the very many [[crypt]]s, numerous due to the importance of the cult of saints at the time, only those of St.&amp;nbsp;Seurin, Bordeaux, [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|St.&amp;nbsp;Laurent, Grenoble]], and the abbey of [[Jouarre Abbey|Jouarre]] (7th century) survive.

==Other arts==
[[File:Sacr Gelasianum 131v 132.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gelasian Sacramentary|Sacramentarium Gelasianum]]. Frontispice and Incipit from the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] manuscript]]
By the 7th century, the abilities of Merovingian craftsmen must have been well regarded, as they were brought to England to re-introduce glass making skills, and Merovingian stonemasons were used to build English churches.&lt;ref name="bede"&gt;Bede. ''The Lives of the Holy Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow''.&lt;/ref&gt; Merovingian masons also employed the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' extensively and are responsible for bringing it to England and bequeathing it to the [[Normans]], who brought it to Italy.

Very few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts survive, of which the most richly decorated is the 8th century [[Gelasian Sacramentary]] in the [[Vatican Library]], which has geometric and animal decoration, less complex than that of the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, but like it derived from metalwork motifs, with some influence from Late Antiquity and the Near-East. The principal centres were the [[Abbey of Luxeuil]], an [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish]] foundation, and later its daughter house at [[Corbie Abbey]].

A large Merovingian art collection in Berlin was taken by Soviet Occupiers to Russia, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Effros|first1=Bonnie|title=Uncovering the Germanic Past: Merovingian Archaeology in France, 1830-1914|date=14 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696710|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Germany Worried About Losing Out in Looted Art Row {{!}} Culture {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 16.08.2007|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-worried-about-losing-out-in-looted-art-row/a-2738594|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=DW.COM|agency=DW|date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Russia displays looted German treasure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/13/russia.secondworldwar|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milk-cap''' (also '''milk cap''', '''milkcap''', or '''milky''') is a [[common name]] that refers to [[mushroom]]-forming [[fungi]] of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Lactarius]]'', ''[[Lactifluus]]'', and ''[[Multifurca]]'', all in the family [[Russulaceae]]. The common and eponymous feature of their [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruitbodies]] is the latex ("milk") they exude when cut or bruised. Mushrooms with typical milk-cap characteristics are said to have a '''lactarioid''' [[habit (biology)|habit]].  Some of them are [[edible mushroom|edible]].

Historically, these species were all united in the genus ''Lactarius'', but [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis has shown that they belong in fact to three distinct [[clades]]:&lt;ref name=Buyck2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buyck2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbeken2013"/&gt;

'''Mining Machinery Engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] that applies the principles of [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of [[:Category:Mining equipment|mining equipment]]. It includes study of various aspects of equipment used in [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], [[mineral processing]], [[bulk material handling]], [[drilling]]  and [[construction]].

==History==

Surface mining equipment evolved at a high pace in the 20th century as the scale of mining grew up. In the first twenty years of the 1900s, steam power was largely replaced by [[internal combustion engines]] and [[electric motors]]. Till the 1970s such equipment mainly used mechanical system and cables for power transmission after which they started to be replaced by [[hydraulic drive system]] for small machines. However, mechanical and cable drives are still dominant in large machines.
Similar development took place in the development of underground machinery. [[Drilling]] and [[Rock blasting|blasting]] replaced manual cutting of ores. Lately, use of [[continuous mining machines]] has become order of the day to comply with environmental regulations, protect surface features and also to achieve increased production rate.
As the concern for safety in mines increased and highly stringent regulations were put in place, it required mining machinery engineers to be highly conversant with such regulations.

==Employment==

Since Mining Machinery Engineering is a wholesome branch, the course of which covers disciplines like [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Mining Engineering]], [[Mineral Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], the employment opportunities are tremendous. Mining Machinery Engineering provides excellent career opportunities in various industries such as [[mining]], [[heavy earth moving equipment]], [[construction industry]], mineral processing and other related industries. It is recognized by the [[Ministry of Labor]], Government of India as equivalent to mechanical and electrical engineering for working in mines.

[[Image:IntitutMittagLeffler.jpg|thumb|Mittag Leffler Institute.]]
[[Image:IML-Kuskvillan.jpg|thumb|Kuskvillan at the Mittag Leffler Institute.]]

The '''Mittag-Leffler Institute''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] research institute located in [[Djursholm]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]]. It invites scholars to participate in year-long or half-year programs in specialized mathematical subjects. The Institute is run by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] on behalf of research societies representing all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

The Institute's main building was originally the residence of [[Magnus Gustaf (Gösta) Mittag-Leffler]], who donated it along with his extensive mathematics library. At his death in 1927, however, Mittag-Leffler's fortune was insufficient to set up an active research institute, which began operation only in 1969 under the leadership of [[Lennart Carleson]].

The journals [[Acta Mathematica]] and [[Arkiv för Matematik]] are published by the institute. For a number of years at the beginning of the 20th century, Mittag's villa hosted a celebratory dinner for [[Nobel Prize]] laureates.

==Notable visitors==

Each year the institute invites the best mathematician in their fields to work on specific mathematical themes. Some notable past visitors include:

[[Louis Billera]], [[Sy Friedman]], [[John B. Garnett]], [[Roger Heath-Brown]], [[Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurður Helgason]], [[Helge Holden]], [[Harry Kesten]], [[Donald Knuth]], [[George Lusztig]], [[Paul Malliavin]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Lynn Steen]], [[André Weil]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Günter M. Ziegler]], [[Kenneth Falconer (mathematician)|Kenneth Falconer]].

'''Ottonian Architecture''' is an architectural style which evolved during the reign of Emperor [[Otto the Great]]. The style was found in [[Germany]] and lasted from the mid 10th century until the mid 11th century.

Ottonian architecture draws its inspiration from [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from some examples influenced by the octagonal [[Palatine Chapel at Aachen]] such as [[Ottmarsheim]] (11th century, Alsace) and the apse of the abbey of the Holy Trinity at Essen, religious architecture tends to diverge from the centralised plan. Inspiration though from the Roman [[basilica]] remains concurrent, and Ottonian architecture preserves the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] double ended feature with apses at either end of the church.

==Examples==
*[[St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], Belgium.
*[[Church of St. Gertrude]], [[Nivelles]], Belgium (1046)
*[[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|Church of St. Michael]], [[Hildesheim]], Germany (1010–33)
*[[Abbey Church of Gernrode]] (960–965, apparently the first in Europe to have a [[tribune (architecture)|tribune]] gallery)

[[Image:eqresp2.png|right|thumb|200px|A plot of the peak acceleration for the mixed vertical oscillators]]
A '''response spectrum''' is a plot of the peak or steady-state response (displacement, velocity or acceleration) of a series of [[oscillators]] of varying [[natural frequency]], that are forced into motion by the same base [[vibration]] or [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]]. The resulting plot can then be used to pick off the response of any [[linear]] system, given its natural frequency of oscillation. One such use is in assessing the peak response of buildings to [[earthquake]]s.  The science of [[strong ground motion]] may use some values from the ground response spectrum (calculated from recordings of surface ground motion from [[seismograph]]s) for correlation with seismic damage.

If the input used in calculating a response spectrum is steady-state periodic, then the steady-state result is recorded. Damping must be present, or else the response will be infinite. For transient input (such as seismic ground motion), the peak response is reported. Some level of damping is generally assumed, but a value will be obtained even with no damping.

Response spectra can also be used in assessing the response of linear systems with multiple modes of [[oscillation]] (multi-degree of freedom systems), although they are only accurate for low levels of damping. [[Modal analysis]] is performed to identify the modes, and the response in that mode can be  picked from the response spectrum. These peak responses are then combined to estimate a total response. A typical combination method is the square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) if the modal frequencies are not close. The result is typically different from that which would be calculated directly from an input, since phase information is lost in the process of generating the response spectrum.

The main limitation of response spectra is that they are only universally applicable for [[linear]] systems. Response spectra can be generated for [[non-linear]] systems, but are only applicable to systems with the same non-linearity, although attempts have been made to develop non-linear seismic design spectra with wider structural application. The results of this cannot be directly combined for multi-mode response.

== Seismic response spectra ==

Response spectra are very useful tools of [[earthquake engineering]] for analyzing the performance of [[structures]] and equipment in earthquakes, since many behave principally as simple [[oscillator]]s (also known as [[single degree of freedom]] systems).  Thus, if you can find out the [[natural frequency]] of the structure, then the peak response of the building can be estimated by reading the value from the ground response spectrum for the appropriate frequency. In most building codes in seismic regions, this value forms the basis for calculating the forces that a structure must be designed to resist ([[Seismic analysis#Response spectrum analysis|seismic analysis]]).

As mentioned earlier, the ground response spectrum is the response plot done at the free surface of the earth.  Significant seismic damage may occur if the building response is 'in tune' with components of the ground motion ([[resonance]]), which may be identified from the response spectrum.  This was observed in the 1985 Mexico City Earthquake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206063939/http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/world/1985_09_19.html|url=http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/world/1985_09_19.html|title=Earthquake Hazards Program: Michoacan, Mexico 1985 September 19 13:17:47 UTC, Magnitude 8.0|archivedate=6 February 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the oscillation of the deep-soil lake bed was similar to the natural frequency of mid-rise concrete buildings, causing significant damage. Shorter (stiffer) and taller (more flexible) buildings suffered less damage.

In 1941 at Caltech, [[George W. Housner]] began to publish calculations of response spectra from [[accelerograph]]s.{{ref|Housner}} In the 1982 [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|EERI]] Monograph on "Earthquake Design and Spectra",{{ref|Newmark}} Newmark and Hall describe how they developed an "idealized" seismic response spectrum based on a range of response spectra generated for available earthquake records. This was then further developed into a design response spectrum for use in structural design, and this basic form (with some modifications) is now the basis for structural design in seismic regions throughout the world (typically plotted against structural "period", the inverse of frequency). A nominal level of damping is assumed (5% of critical damping).

For "regular" low-rise buildings, the structural response to earthquakes is characterized by the fundamental mode (a "waving" back-and-forth), and most building codes permit design forces to be calculated from the design spectrum on the basis of that frequency, but for more complex structures, combination of the results for many modes (calculated through modal analysis) is often required. In extreme cases, where structures are either too irregular, too tall or of significance to a community in disaster response, the response spectrum approach is no longer appropriate, and more complex analysis is required, such as [[non-linear]] [[Seismic analysis#Nonlinear Static Analysis|static]] or [[Seismic analysis#Nonlinear dynamic analysis|dynamic analysis]] like in [[seismic performance analysis]] technique.

'''''Round About a Pound a Week''''' was an influential&lt;ref name=Oren&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oren|first=Laura |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Winter–Spring 1973 |title=The Welfare of Women in Laboring Families:England, 1860-1950 |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |pages=107 |id= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1913 survey of poverty and [[infant mortality]] in London, by feminist and socialist [[Maud Pember Reeves]], co-authored by anarchist activist [[Charlotte Wilson]].  The project was conceived and carried out under the auspices of the [[Fabian Society]]'s Women's Group, which she co-founded in 1908. The report was originally published as a political pamphlet or tract, arguing for specific reforms, but is still in print and considered relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzine.co.nz/views/maud_reeves.html nzine review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/30/round-about-pound-maud-pember-reeves] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review of 2008 reissue&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
[[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09|A Royal Commission]] was gathering evidence on the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]]; [[Beatrice Webb]] was a commissioner, and contributed to [[Minority report (Poor Law)|the Minority Report]], but she could see that most of the commission had a [[Majority report (Poor Law)|different vision to implement]].  Webb was also a member of the Fabian Society, a precursor to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as was Pember Reeves. They wanted to understand and alleviate poverty, so they focussed their attention on a few dozen families in [[Lambeth]], a poor borough in [[South London]] and still one of the poorest parts of Britain,&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; and recorded their attempt at [[social reform]] over the four years just before the [[Great War]], i.e. 1909–1913. The families they selected were ''not'' the poorest; they were the "respectable poor" of the working class, with the menfolk in relatively stable employment, earning "about a [[pound (sterling)|pound]] a week"; nonetheless, one in five of the [[infant mortality|children died at birth]], and another one in ten before they reached adulthood. The project targeted pregnant women, and offered them money for extra food from a few months before the birth until several months afterwards. The families kept detailed budgets of their income and expenditure. 

The book contains details of the division of food within the family, with the breadwinner being given a much greater share of the food than the rest of the family. This was because the other family members were completely dependent on the breadwinner. Nonetheless, this was rarely a sufficient amount.&lt;ref name=Oren /&gt; The conditions in the book have been described as "appalling",&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;Rose, Sonya O, 1993, "Limited Livelihoods. Gender and Class in nineteenth-Century England". University of California Press. p.79&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the daily struggle these women faced to feed their families without being "forced to pawn their own boots".&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;

It has also been noted that Reeves avoided the "sense of moral superiority" common in outside observers of these people, seeing them as "independent, resourceful, hard-working, respectable, but poor".&lt;ref name=Perkin&gt;Perkin, Joan, 1989. "Women and Marriage in nineteenth-Century England". Routledge, London. p 131&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Fabian pamphlet argued for government reforms, including [[child benefit]], [[school dinner]]s, and free [[primary health care|health clinics]]. It also noted the role of poor housing conditions in child mortality, and how prenatal nutrition could help.

==Background==
The term probably originated from the concept that enough water is "squeezed" out of the slurry to render it unflowable, so the portion that has actually entered the zone will stay in place when the squeeze pressure is removed.  After surface indications (e.g., pressure reaching a predetermined maximum) that a squeeze has been attained, any still-pumpable cement slurry remaining in the [[drill pipe]] or tubing ideally can be reverse circulated out before it sets.

Usually the zone to be squeezed is isolated from above with a packer (and possibly from below with a bridge plug), but sometimes the squeezing pressure is applied to the entire [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] string in what is known as a '''bradenhead squeeze''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mms.gov/glossary/bo-by.htm | publisher=[[Minerals Management Service]] | title=Offshore Minerals Management Glossary BO-BY | accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (named for an old manufacturer of [[casing head]]s).

Even if a drilling rig is on location, pumping operations usually are done by a service company's cementing unit that can easily mix small batches of cement slurry, measure displacement volume accurately to spot the slurry on bottom, then pump at very low rates and high pressures during the squeeze itself, and finally measure volumes accurately again when reversing out any excess slurry.  A '''squeeze manifold''' is a compact arrangement of valves and pressure gauges that allows monitoring of the drill pipe and casing pressures throughout the job, and facilitates quick switching of the pumping pressure to either side while the fluid returning from the other side of well is directed to the mud pit or a disposal pit or tank.

The generic term "squeeze" also can apply to injection of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure.  '''Bullhead squeeze''' (or just plain [[bullheading]]) refers to pumping kill-weight [[Drilling mud|mud]] down the casing beneath closed [[blowout preventer]]s in a [[Blowout (well drilling)|kick-control]] situation when it isn't feasible to circulate in such from bottom.

'''Symbolic communication''' is exchange of messages that change ''a priori'' expectation of events. Examples of this are modern [[communication]] technology and the exchange of information amongst animals. 
By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in our current state of modernity.

==Animal Societies==
{{See also|Animal communication|Bee learning and communication}}
In animal societies, symbolic communication helps one understand the conduct of members of cooperating groups. The behavior of [[weaver ant]] workers has been carefully studied and it has been found that communicative gestures with respect to members of the same [[colony]] are different from those used with intruders. The interpretation of the symbolic dance of [[honey bee]]s as a communicative language has been questioned by a few, though numerous experimental results over the last several decades have effectively laid this controversy to rest.

==Human Societies==
An example of symbolic communication in  humans is the wearing of uniforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A man in a white coat with a stethoscope will often be perceived as a doctor on the basis of his appearance alone. Military uniforms have badges and insignias which indicate rank and honours as well as their branch of operation. Humans are the only species who use a symbolic language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=2004|title=13Cooperation and the Evolution of Symbolic Communication|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30820582/2004_MIT_EvolutionOfCommunication.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1480437082&amp;Signature=5%2FcPLjb2v%2FdlbFteER5AT5UDFX4%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSocial_and_cultural_learning_in_the_evol.pdf#page=248|journal=Evolution of Communication Systems|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils''''' ({{lang-de|The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice}}) is a standard work of Germanophone research into [[homophobia]], written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], and first published in 1978.

== Background ==

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete ''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils'' (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word ''Tabu'' from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Michel Foucault]], she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.

== Authority ==

''Tabu Homosexualität'' is considered a foundational standard work in Germanophone research into homophobia, misogyny, patriarchy, general repression of sensuality and particularly repression of sexual deviance (''Leibfeindlichkeit'').&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen, Wolfgang (1980).

== Content ==

=== Introducing chapters ===

In the prefacing ''Einführung'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.

In order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, ''Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen'' ("Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong [[numinous]] taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative ''in themselves''.

Only three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the third volume of his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' mentioned a tribe of ''Karmans'' among whom "lewdness between men ''[...]'', as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by [[Posidonius]], quoted in [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', on [[Celts|Celtic]] sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.

The third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ''ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames'' ("cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted") by proto-historic [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] as mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.

=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.

Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:

*The Stone Age ''Subarctic Shamanic Culture'' of the [[last glacial period]] (called ''Würm'' regarding the Alps region, ''Weichsel'' regarding Scandinavia, and ''Devensian'' regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,
*the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' of European and Middle East [[Bronze Age]], introducing farming and practicing [[fertility rite|fertility cults]] including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's ''"[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]"''),
*and the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see [[Bronze Age collapse]], [[Kurgan hypothesis]], and [[Æsir-Vanir War#Theories]]), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European [[Iron Age]] in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Not all subsequent Indo-European or Indo-European-influenced cultures adopted or retained Indo-European languages. For instance, Semitic cultures never adopted an Indo-European language in spite of the obvious belligerent, sensually repressive Indo-European influence found in Abrahamitic and Semitic cultures. See Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1990 work ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'' based in this respect mainly on [[:de:Reinhard Schmoeckel|Reinhard Schmoeckel]]'s ''Indogermanistik'' research.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Three-age system]]. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] by [[Georges Dumézil]], of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and what Gimbutas saw as "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See [[Proto-Indo-European society]] for details.

The immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting [[religious stratification]] emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility [[Vanir]] and belligerent, patriarchal [[Æsir]] religion, with the mythological [[Æsir-Vanir War]] as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]] in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.

=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:

*'''Chapter IV, ''Interdependenzen zwischen religiösen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen'' ("Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture"):''' Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic ''[[Níð|nithing]]'' creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the ''nithing'' are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.
*'''Chapter V, ''Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen'' ("Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics"), section 1, ''Die römische Gesetzgebung'' ("Roman laws"):''' Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'', only emphasizing in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' and later works that [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]] does not meet her primary focus for ''Tabu Homosexualität'' of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, [[Kenneth Dover]]).
*'''Chapter V, section 2, ''Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen'' ("Ecclesiastical regulations"):''' Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture ([[Leviticus 18]]) and in Early Christianity ([[Saint Paul]], early [[Church Fathers]], and [[penitential]]s) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common ''Sodom myth'' created by Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that [[Genesis 19]] would in any way relate to same-sex activities.
*'''Chapter V, section 3, ''Die gefälschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita'' ("The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita"):''' The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of ''[[sodomy]]'' brought forth by the forged ''[[Benedictus Levita|Capitularia Benedicti Levitae]]'' within ''[[Pseudo-Isidore]]'' (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by [[Franks|Frankish]] monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd ''seid'' magic of a ''nithing'' in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's ''Sodom myth'', Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the ''Capitularia Benedicti Levitae'' obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of ''sodomy'' with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning ''nithings'' into ecclesiastical law as burning ''sodomites'' and ''witches'' alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.
*'''Chapter VI, ''Die Pönalisierung der Homosexualität im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters'' ("The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials"):''' How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on ''sodomites'' and ''witches''.
*'''Chapter VII, ''Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualität bis 1870'' ("Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870"):''' Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of ''[[moral insanity]]''), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.
*'''Chapter VIII, ''Beeinträchtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegenüber der männlichen Homosexualität durch das Vorurteil selbst'' ("Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself"):''' Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general ''Vorurteilsforschung'' (''prejudice studies'') in her later work ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===

In ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western [[colonialism]] when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|Age of Conquests]] on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of [[syphilis]] through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.

These processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over "uncivilized", sensual, and "filthy" "savages" (see for instance the saying of the ''[[White man's burden]]'' of being morally obliged to "civilize" non-Westerners), social and ethnic "aliens", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (''Tabu Homosexualität'', ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and ''Angst und Vorurteil'') Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' by [[Hannah Arendt]], Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Critical Theory's ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', or ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' by [[Norbert Elias]].

Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in ''Angst und Vorurteil'', just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific Enlightenment]] approach to sexuality, the impact of [[HIV]] corrupted [[Counterculture of the 1960s|post-WWII progressive counterculture]]'s influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">The '''Tu{{okina}}ungafasi''' or '''Tongan music notation''' is a subset of the standard [[music notation]], originally developed by the [[missionary]] [[James Egan Moulton]] in the 19th century for singing church hymns in [[Tonga]].

== The notation ==
Tongan music from the pre-European times was not really music in the current sense but rather a non tonic recital (like the 'pater noster'), a style still known nowadays as the [[tau fakaniua]]. Therefore, when the missionaries started to teach singing, they had also to start with music from scratch. They found the doh-ray-mi-fah-sol-la-si-doh scale sufficient for their needs, avoiding the very complex and difficult to learn international music notation. But due to the limited number of [[consonants]] in the [[Tongan language]], the note names were localised into to-le-mi… Unfortunately the word 'tole' is a [[sexual slang|vulgar expression]] for the [[vulva|Female genital area]], and as such not to be used.

Moulton then developed a system where the main notes were indicated with the numbers 3 to 9, while a strike to the digits was used to sharpen them, for example: &lt;s&gt;7&lt;/s&gt;, being 7# or 8b. At the end the full 12 notes of the octave became: 3-&lt;s&gt;3&lt;/s&gt;-4-&lt;s&gt;4&lt;/s&gt;-5-6-&lt;s&gt;6&lt;/s&gt;-7-&lt;s&gt;7&lt;/s&gt;-8-&lt;s&gt;8&lt;/s&gt;-9, which are pronounced as: to-lu-fa-ma-ni-o-no-tu-fi-va-a-hi, (variants of the Tongan numerals 3 to 9 being tolu, fā, nima, ono, fitu, valu, hiva). To extend the single [[octave]] ([[MIDI]] octave number 4) into the next higher, a dot can be put above the number. To reach the next lower, a dot or a little tail can be put under them. If needed 2 tails can be taken to arrive at even lower pitches, but that is rare. Since the notation is made for human singing, it does not need to have the extended range of musical instruments.

The Moulton notation, or Tongan notation was extremely popular and is still cherished by the Tongans. It is extremely common to see bandmasters writing out the music on the blackboards in the church halls during choir practices.

===Pitch===
Tongan singers recognise up to 4 voices, which results in the typical 4 lines of numbers in the notation. The leading voice is called 'fasi', a male voice. The next one is ''kānokano'' or alto, a female voice. The third is the ''tēnoa'' or tenor, and the last one the ''laulalo'' or bass. Occasionally the bass sings different lyrics from the rest. The middle octave (of the 3 octave range mentioned above) varies with the voice, the kānokano is usually one above the tēnoa, while the laulalo is one below. In addition the exact position of the middle doh or C depends on the [[key signature]] as in this schedule:

[[Image:TongaKeys.png]]

When 3 notes are shown, the fasi and alto are together on top, the tenor is in the middle, and the bass is on bottom. When 2 notes are shown, the tenor and bass are taken together, as otherwise the basses would come too low. Some musicians, however, take the bass octave always equal the tenor, causing for some signatures the bass coming too high. Then they need 2 tails under a number to reach a really low note.

===Duration===
The duration of a note is not indicated by a different symbols, as in the international music notation but by the number of notes in a beat. The more notes in a beat, the shorter each has to be. For example, in the [[Ko e fasi 'o e tu'i 'o e 'Otu Tonga|fasi {{okina}}o e tu{{okina}}i {{okina}}o e {{okina}}outTonga]] (national anthem), we find as first measure:  '''|3:-3/5:5|6:4/5:-5|'''

Every vertical bar (|) is a measure separator (often double at the begin and end of a stanza). As this music has a 4/4 [[time signature]], there appear 4 beats, every beat separated by a colon (:) or slash (/) (they are equal, but the slash is usually used in the middle and the colon elsewhere). The time signature also indicates that every beat is a quarter note. Therefore, every single digit in a beat is a quarter note. When 2 digits appear they are each eighth notes and so forth. No digit at all, or a zero, is used for a rest, while a dash is a tie. The first measure of the example above thus becomes: a C note for 3/8 duration, another C for 1/8, followed by two quarter E's.

'''|3:-|-:-|''' is an example for a 2/4 timesignature; 2 beats in a measure, every beat a quarter note long. This results in a whole C. Note that the tie dashes can extend into following measures, unlike the international music notation where the note is to be repeated and then tie arcs are needed. Some Tonga musicians following that example, would also write a 3 in the second measure instead of a dash and also would then need tie arcs.

===More time signatures===
In 2/4 (like |3:4|) and 3/4 (like |3:4:5|) and 4/4 (like |3:4/5:6|) time signature every beat is a quarter note. Two digits (…:34:…) makes each an eighth note; have four digits (…:3456:…) and each is a sixteenth. Three digits (…:345:…) are possible, the first one being a quarter and both others each an eighth, but might be confusing. Some musicians put a comma or dot inside the beat (…:3,45:…) to remind the singers of the unequal duration. But the real use is with a tie (…:3-4:…), to have a 3/8 note followed by a 1/8.

2/2 and 3/2 signatures are rarer, but work the same as the …/4 signatures except that all beats are twice as long. One digit in a beat being a half note and so forth.

Occasionally one finds 6/8 (like |3:4|) and 12/8 (like |3:4:5:6|) time signatures. Then every single digit is a 3/8 note, while the most common occurrence is 3 digits in one beat, (…:345:…) each of them of course one eighth. Also here two digits are possible, the first one being a quarter and the second an eight, but again with all the pitfalls as the 3 digits in the …/4 notation. It is mainly used for (…:3:-4:…) meaning a 5/8 note followed by a 1/8.

The '''trihydrogen cation''', also known as '''protonated molecular hydrogen''' or '''{{chem|H|3|+}}''', is one of the most abundant [[ion]]s in the universe. It is stable in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) due to the low temperature and low density of interstellar space. The role that {{chem|H|3|+}} plays in the gas-phase chemistry of the ISM is unparalleled by any other molecular ion. The [[cation]] is also the simplest triatomic [[molecule]], since its two electrons are the only valence electrons in the system. It is also the simplest example of a [[three-center two-electron bond]] system.

==History==
{{chem|H|3|+}} was first discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="elecrays"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |date=1913 |title=Rays of Positive Electricity |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=89 |issue=607 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0057 |bibcode = 1913RSPSA..89....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the resultant species of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, he discovered something very odd. Using an early form of [[mass spectrometry]], he discovered a large abundance of a [[molecular]] ion with a [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of 3. He stated that the only two possibilities were C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; or {{chem|H|3|+}}. Since C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; would be very unlikely and the signal grew stronger in pure [[hydrogen]] gas, he correctly assigned the species as {{chem|H|3|+}}.

The formation pathway was discovered by Hogness &amp; Lunn in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogness |first=T. R. |author2=Lunn, E. G. |date=1925 |title=The Ionization of Hydrogen by Electron Impact as Interpreted by Positive Ray Analysis |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.26.44 |bibcode = 1925PhRv...26...44H }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also used an early form of mass spectrometry to study hydrogen discharges. They found that as the pressure of hydrogen increased, the amount of {{chem|H|3|+}} increased linearly and the amount of {{chem|H|2|+}} decreased linearly. In addition, there was little H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at any pressure. This data suggested the [[proton]] exchange formation pathway discussed below.

In 1961, Martin ''et al.'' first suggested that {{chem|H|3|+}} may be present in interstellar space given the large amount of hydrogen in interstellar space and its reaction pathway was [[exothermic]] (~1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]).&lt;ref name="occurrence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=D. W. |author2=McDaniel, E. W. |author3=Meeks, M. L. |date=1961 |title=On the Possible Occurrence of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Interstellar Space |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=134 |page=1012 |doi= 10.1086/147232|bibcode=1961ApJ...134.1012M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the suggestion of Watson and Herbst &amp; Klemperer in 1973 that {{chem|H|3|+}} is responsible for the formation of many observed molecular ions.&lt;ref name="Watson1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=W. D. |date=1973 |title=The Rate of Formation of Interstellar Molecules by Ion-Molecule Reactions |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=183 |issue=2 |pages=L17 |doi=10.1086/181242 |bibcode=1973ApJ...183L..17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |author2=Klemperer, W. |date=1973 |title=The Formation and Depletion of Molecules in Dense Interstellar Clouds |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=185 |page=505 |doi=10.1086/152436 |bibcode=1973ApJ...185..505H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1980 that the first spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} was discovered by Takeshi Oka,&lt;ref name="Oka1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oka |first=T. |date=1980 |title=Observation of the Infrared Spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=45 |issue= 7|pages=531–534 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.531 |bibcode=1980PhRvL..45..531O}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was of the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band using a technique called [[frequency modulation]] detection. This started the search for interstellar {{chem|H|3|+}}. [[Emission line]]s were detected in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the [[ionosphere]]s of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Uranus]].&lt;ref name="Drossart1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drossart |first=P. |display-authors=etal |date=1989 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} on Jupiter |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=340 |issue=6234 |page=539 |doi=10.1038/340539a0 |bibcode = 1989Natur.340..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geballe1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T. R. |display-authors=etal |date=1993 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} Infrared Emission Lines in Saturn |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=408 |issue=2 |pages=L109 |doi=10.1086/186843 |bibcode=1993ApJ...408L.109G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trafton1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trafton |first=L.

In 1996, {{chem|H|3|+}} was finally detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) by Geballe &amp; Oka in two molecular [[interstellar clouds]] in the sightlines GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T. R. |author2=Oka, T. |date=1996 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Interstellar Space |journal=Nature |volume=384 |issue=6607 |pages=334–335 |doi=10.1038/384334a0 |pmid=8934516 |bibcode = 1996Natur.384..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, {{chem|H|3|+}} was unexpectedly detected by McCall ''et al.'' in a diffuse interstellar cloud in the sightline [[Cygnus OB2-12|Cygnus OB2#12]].&lt;ref name="McCall1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCall |first=B. J. |display-authors=etal |date=1998 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in the Diffuse Interstellar Medium Toward Cygnus OB2 No. 12 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=279 |issue=5358 |pages=1910–1913 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5358.1910 |bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1910M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Oka announced that {{chem|H|3|+}} was ubiquitous in interstellar medium, and that the [[Central Molecular Zone]] contained a million times the concentration of ISM generally.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

[[File:Trihydrogen-cation-MO-diagram.svg|thumb|380px|The [[MO diagram]] of the trihydrogen cation.]]
The three hydrogen atoms in the molecule form an [[equilateral triangle]], with a [[bond length]] of 0.90&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] on each side. The bonding among the atoms is a [[three-center two-electron bond|three-centre two-electron bond]], a [[delocalized]] resonance hybrid type of structure. The strength of the bond has been calculated to be around 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (104&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCall |first=B. J. |display-authors=etal |date=2004 |title=Dissociative Recombination of Rotationally Cold {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=Physical Review A |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=052716 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052716 |bibcode = 2004PhRvA..70e2716M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
&lt;!--The information for this section was from a paper by Eric Herbst.--&gt;The main pathway for the production of {{chem|H|3|+}} is by the reaction of [[Dihydrogen cation|{{chem|H|2|+}}]] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |date=2000 |title=The Astrochemistry of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|volume=358 |issue=1774 |pages=2523–2534 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{chem|H|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|3|+}} + H

The concentration of {{chem|H|2|+}} is what limits the rate of this reaction in nature: the only known natural source of it is via ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[cosmic ray]] in interstellar space by the ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + cosmic ray → {{chem|H|2|+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + cosmic ray

The cosmic ray has so much energy, it is almost unaffected by the relatively small energy transferred to the hydrogen when ionizing an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. In interstellar clouds, cosmic rays leave behind a trail of {{chem|H|2|+}}, and therefore {{chem|H|3|+}}. In laboratories, {{chem|H|3|+}} is produced by the same mechanism in plasma discharge cells, with the discharge potential providing the energy to ionize the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Destruction==
The information for this section was also from a paper by Eric Herbst.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt; There are many destruction reactions for {{chem|H|3|+}}. The dominant destruction pathway in dense interstellar clouds is by proton transfer with a neutral collision partner. The most likely candidate for a destructive collision partner is the second most abundant molecule in space, [[carbon monoxide|CO]].

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + CO → HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The significant product of this reaction is HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an important molecule for interstellar chemistry. Its strong [[dipole]] and high abundance make it easily detectable by [[radioastronomy]]. {{chem|H|3|+}} can also react with atomic [[oxygen]] to form OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + O → OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; then usually reacts with more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create further [[hydrogenate]]d molecules.

:OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|OH|2|+}} + H
:{{chem|OH|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Hydronium|{{chem|OH|3|+}}]] + H

At this point, the reaction between {{chem|OH|3|+}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer exothermic in interstellar clouds. The most common destruction pathway for {{chem|OH|3|+}} is [[dissociative recombination]], yielding four possible sets of products: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H, OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, OH + 2H, and O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H. While [[water]] is a possible product of this reaction, it is not a very efficient product. Different experiments have suggested that water is created anywhere from 5–33% of the time. Water formation on [[cosmic dust|grains]] is still considered the primary source of water in the interstellar medium.

The most common destruction pathway of {{chem|H|3|+}} in diffuse interstellar clouds is dissociative recombination. This reaction has multiple products. The major product is dissociation into three hydrogen atoms, which occurs roughly 75% of the time. The minor product is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H, which occurs roughly 25% of the time.

==Ortho/Para-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;==
[[Image:H3+&amp;H2.svg|thumb|350px|A collision of ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The most abundant molecule in dense interstellar clouds is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When a {{chem|H|3|+}} molecule collides with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, stoichiometrically there is no net yield. However, a proton transfer still can take place, which can potentially change the total [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] of the two molecules depending on the nuclear spins of the protons. Two different spin configurations for {{chem|H|3|+}} are possible, called ortho and para. Ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} has all three proton spins parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|3|2}}. Para-{{chem|H|3|+}} has two proton spins parallel while the other is anti-parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}. Similarly, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also has [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|ortho and para states]], with ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin 1 and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin of 0. When an ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and a para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; collide, the transferred proton changes the total spins of the molecules, yielding instead a para-{{chem|H|3|+}} and an ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt;

==Spectroscopy==
The [[spectroscopy]] of {{chem|H|3|+}} is challenging. The pure rotational spectrum is exceedingly weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546–544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultraviolet light is too energetic and would dissociate the molecule. [[Rovibronic excitation|Rovibronic]] (Infrared) spectroscopy provides the ability to observe {{chem|H|3|+}}. Rovibronic spectroscopy is possible with {{chem|H|3|+}} because one of the [[normal mode|vibrational modes]] of {{chem|H|3|+}}, the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asymmetric bend mode, has a weak transition dipole moment. Since Oka's initial spectrum,&lt;ref name="Oka1980" /&gt; over 900 [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]] lines have been detected in the infrared region. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines have also been found by observing the atmospheres of the Jovian planets. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines are found by observing molecular hydrogen and finding a line that cannot be attributed to molecular hydrogen.

==Astronomical detection==
{{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in two types of celestial environments: Jovian planets and interstellar clouds. In Jovian planets, it has been detected in the planet's ionospheres, the region where the Sun's high energy radiation ionizes the particles in the atmosphere. Since there is a high level of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in these atmospheres, this radiation can produce a significant amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. Also, with a broadband source like the Sun, there is plenty of radiation to pump the {{chem|H|3|+}} to higher energy states from which it can relax by stimulated and spontaneous emission.

===Planetary atmospheres===
The detection of the first {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines was reported in 1989 by Drossart ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Drossart1989" /&gt; found in the ionosphere of Jupiter. Drossart found a total of 23 {{chem|H|3|+}} lines with a column density of 1.39{{e|9}}/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using these lines, they were able to assign a temperature to the {{chem|H|3|+}} of around {{convert|1100|K|°C|abbr=on}}, which is comparable to temperatures determined from emission lines of other species like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1993, {{chem|H|3|+}} was found in Saturn by Geballe ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Geballe1993" /&gt; and in Uranus by Trafton ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Trafton1993" /&gt;

===Molecular interstellar clouds===
{{chem|H|3|+}} was not detected in the interstellar medium until 1996, when Geballe &amp; Oka reported the detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in two molecular cloud sightlines, GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996" /&gt; Both sources had temperatures of {{chem|H|3|+}} of about {{convert|35|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and column densities of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in numerous other molecular cloud sightlines, such as AFGL 2136,&lt;ref name="McCall1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=1999|title=Observations of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Dense Molecular Clouds|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=522|issue=1|pages=338–348|doi=10.1086/307637|bibcode=1999ApJ...522..338M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mon R2 IRS 3,&lt;ref name="McCall1999" /&gt; GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goto|first=M.|display-authors=etal |date=2002|title=Absorption Line Survey of {{chem|H|3|+}} toward the Galactic Center Sources I. GCS 3-2 and GC IRS3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|volume=54Àissue=6|page=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; GC IRS 3,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; and LkHα 101.&lt;ref name="Brittain2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brittain|first=S. D.|display-authors=etal |date=2004|title=Interstellar {{chem|H|3|+}} Line Absorption toward LkHα 101|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=606|issue=2|pages=911–916|doi=10.1086/383024|bibcode=2004ApJ...606..911B|url=https://works.bepress.com/sean_brittain/7/download/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffuse interstellar clouds===
Unexpectedly, three {{chem|H|3|+}} lines were detected in 1998 by McCall ''et al.'' in the diffuse cloud sightline of Cyg OB2 No. 12.&lt;ref name="McCall1998" /&gt; Before 1998, the density of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was thought to be too low to produce a detectable amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. McCall detected a temperature of ~{{convert|27|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and a column density of ~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the same column density as Geballe &amp; Oka. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in many other diffuse cloud sightlines, such as GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; GC IRS 3,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; and ζ Persei.&lt;ref name="McCall2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=2003|title=An Enhanced Cosmic-ray Flux towards ζ Persei Inferred from a Laboratory Study of the {{chem|H|3|+}}-e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Recombination Rate|journal=Nature|volume=422|issue=6931|doi=10.1038/nature01498|pmid=12673244|arxiv = astro-ph/0302106 |bibcode = 2003Natur.422..500M|pages=500–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steady-state model predictions===
To approximate the pathlength of {{chem|H|3|+}} in these clouds, Oka&lt;ref name="Oka2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oka|first=T.|date=2006|title=Interstellar H3+|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]|volume=103|issue=33|pages=12235–12242|doi=10.1073/pnas.0601242103|pmid=16894171|pmc=1567864|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312235O }}&lt;/ref&gt; used the steady-state model to determine the predicted number densities in diffuse and dense clouds. As explained above, both diffuse and dense clouds have the same formation mechanism for {{chem|H|3|+}}, but different dominating destruction mechanisms. In dense clouds, proton transfer with CO is the dominating destruction mechanism. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dense clouds.
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(CO)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
In diffuse clouds, the dominating destruction mechanism is dissociative recombination. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in diffuse clouds. Therefore, since column densities for diffuse and dense clouds are roughly the same order of magnitude, diffuse clouds must have a pathlength 100 times greater than that for dense clouds. Therefore, by using {{chem|H|3|+}} as a probe of these clouds, their relative sizes can be determined.

[[File:Storm Drain.JPG|thumb|Urban runoff flowing into a storm drain]]
'''Urban runoff''' is [[surface runoff]] of rainwater created by [[urbanization]]. This runoff is a major source of [[Flood#Urban flooding|flooding]] and [[water pollution]] in urban communities worldwide.

[[Impervious surfaces]] ([[road]]s, [[parking lot]]s and [[sidewalk]]s) are constructed during [[land development]]. During [[rain]] storms and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] events, these surfaces (built from materials such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]]), along with [[roof]]tops, carry polluted [[stormwater]] to [[storm drains]], instead of allowing the water to [[Infiltration (hydrology)|percolate]] through [[soil]].&lt;ref name="USGS-runoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/runoff.html |title=Runoff (surface water runoff) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-02 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes lowering of the [[water table]] (because [[groundwater recharge]] is lessened) and [[flood]]ing since the amount of water that remains on the surface is greater.&lt;ref name="ASCE1"&gt;[http://wef.org/ Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org/ American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}.

This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.

==Urban flooding==
[[File:Walking in the Rain New Orleans.jpg|thumb|Flooded streets in [[New Orleans]]]]
[[File:Natural &amp; impervious cover diagrams EPA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Relationship between [[impervious surfaces]] and [[surface runoff]]]]
Urban runoff is a major cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]], the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of [[drainage|drainage systems]], such as [[storm sewers]].&lt;ref name="USGS-water cycle"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html |title=Surface Runoff - The Water Cycle |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-15 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered by events such as [[flash flooding]], [[storm surges]], overbank flooding, or [[snow melt]], urban flooding is characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities, regardless of whether or not these communities are located within formally designated floodplains or near any body of water.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which stormwater enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with [[basements]], urban flooding is the primary cause of basement flooding.

Flood flows in urban environments have been investigated relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.&lt;ref name=Chanson_2011c&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:243550|title=Turbulent Velocity and Suspended Sediment Concentration Measurements in an Urban Environment of the Brisbane River Flood Plain at Gardens Point on 12–13 January 2011|journal=Hydraulic Model Report No. CH83/11 |year=2011|issue=CH83/11|pages=120 pp|first1=Richard |last1=Brown|authorlink2=Hubert Chanson|first2=Hubert |last2=Chanson|first3= Dave |last3=McIntosh |first4= Jay |last4=Madhani|publisher= The University of Queensland, School of Civil Engineering |location=Brisbane, Australia|isbn=978-1-74272-027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers mentioned the storage effect in urban areas. Several studies looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication in terms of flood modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identifiability of Distributed Floodplain Roughness Values in Flood Extent Estimation|journal=Journal of Hydrology |year=2006|volume=314|pages=139–157|first1=MGF |last1=Werner|first2= NM |last2=Hunter|first3= PD |last3=Bates |doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent research considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]], Brown, R., McIntosh, D. |title= Human body stability in floodwaters: the 2011 flood in Brisbane CBD  | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.14264/uql.2014.48 |publisher=Proceedings of the 5th IAHR International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures (ISHS2014), 25–27 June 2014, Brisbane, Australia, H.

TOOMBES Editors, 9 pages |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1-74272-115-6 | doi=10.14264/uql.2014.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some recent field measurements during the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods]] showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by the velocity and water depth fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2011c" /&gt; These considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2014" /&gt;

==Pollutants==
[[File:Pollutedflood.JPG|thumb|A creek filled with urban runoff after a storm]]
Water running off these impervious surfaces tends to pick up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[heavy metals]], [[waste|trash]] and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]] from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), which are created as [[combustion]] byproducts of gasoline and other [[fossil fuel]]s, as well as of the heavy metals [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], and [[lead]]. Roof runoff contributes high levels of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[organic compound]]s and [[zinc]] (from [[galvanization|galvanized]] gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of [[nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]] in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.&lt;ref name="ASCE1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stormwater Effects Handbook: A Toolbox for Watershed Managers, Scientists, and Engineers|authors=G. Allen Burton, Jr., Robert Pitt|publisher=CRC/Lewis Publishers|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=0-87371-924-7|url=http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/BooksandReports/Stormwater%20Effects%20Handbook%20by%20%20Burton%20and%20Pitt%20book/MainEDFS_Book.html}} Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eroding soils or poorly maintained construction sites can often lead to increased [[Nonpoint source pollution#Sediment|sedimentation]] in runoff. Sedimentation often settles to the bottom of water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and [[suspended solids]] have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well.  Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface. Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs.  This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Environmental Council. Chapter 1: Impacts of urban stormwater runoff. Retrieved from website: http://www.oeconline.org/our-work/rivers/stormwater/stormwater report/impacts&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff can also induce heavy metal poisoning in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans. These metals are ingested by ocean life. These heavy metals cannot be disposed so they accumulate within the animals. Over time, these metals build up to a toxic level, and the animal dies. This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans. If we eat a poisoned animal, we have a chance of getting heavy metal poisoning too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bortman|first1=Marci|title=Marine Pollution|journal=Environmental Encyclopedia|date=2011|volume=3|pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Endangered Oceans|date=2009|publisher=Glenhaven Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stormwater is channeled into storm drains and surface waters, the natural [[sediment]] load discharged to receiving waters decreases, but the water flow and velocity increases. In fact, the impervious cover in a typical city creates five times the runoff of a typical woodland of the same size.&lt;ref name="EPA2"&gt;{{cite report |date=February 2003 |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |url=https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-03-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A 2008 report by the [[United States National Research Council]] (textbox below) identified urban runoff as a leading source of [[water quality]] problems.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="width:25%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;...further declines in water quality remain likely if the land-use changes that typify more diffuse sources of pollution are not addressed... These include land-disturbing agricultural, silvicultural, urban, industrial, and construction activities from which hard-to-monitor pollutants emerge during wet-weather events. Pollution from these landscapes has been almost universally acknowledged as the most pressing challenge to the restoration of waterbodies and aquatic ecosystems nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– National Research Council, ''Urban Stormwater Management in the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=National Research Council (United States) |date=2009 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12465/urban-stormwater-management-in-the-united-states |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |doi=10.17226/12465 |isbn=978-0-309-12539-0 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Weaselbrgrandavpassaicjeh.JPG|thumb|Weasel Brook in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] has been [[River engineering#Channelization|channelized]] with concrete walls to control localized flooding.]]

The runoff also increases temperatures in streams, harming [[fish]] and other organisms. (A sudden burst of runoff from a rainstorm can cause a fish-killing shock of hot water.) Also, [[road salt]] used to melt snow on sidewalks and roadways can contaminate streams and groundwater [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey. Atlanta, GA. [http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/urbanrun.html "The effects of urbanization on water quality: Urban runoff."] Accessed 2009-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most pronounced effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ''[[ephemeral stream]]s''). When an area around such a stream is [[urbanization|urbanized]], the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round [[streamflow]] that hurts the vegetation, [[wildlife]] and [[stream bed]] of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as [[meander]]s and [[sandbar]]s, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the [[stream bed]] upstream. As an example, on many [[Southern California]] beaches at the mouth of a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.

Because of fertilizer and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, [[eutrophication]] often occurs in waterways affected by this type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of [[algae]] blooms that soon consume most of the [[oxygen]]. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as [[stream pool]]s and the pools behind [[dam]]s, [[weir]]s, and some [[drop structure]]s. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.

Excessive stream bank erosion may cause flooding and property damage. For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by [[river engineering]] through construction of hardened [[levee|embankments]] and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. Use of these hard materials destroys habitat for fish and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laws |first1=Edward A. |last2=Roth |first2=Lauren |year=2004 |title=Impact of Stream Hardening on Water Quality and Metabolic Characteristics of Waimanalo and Kane'ohe Streams, O'ahu, Hawaiian Islands |journal=Pacific Science |publisher= University of Hawai'i Press |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages= |hdl=10125/2725 |doi= 10.1353/psc.2004.0019|issn=0030-8870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |chapter=Ch. 3.

Urban flooding has significant economic implications. In the US, industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10%-25% and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013, Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|U.S Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]], almost 40% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (U.S.). "Protecting Your Businesses," last updated March, 2013, http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130917193030/http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses |date=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; 80,000 homes are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, London, UK. [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn289.pdf "Urban Flooding."]  Postnote 289, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[Cook County, Illinois]], identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96% of the county's ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007-2011. This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim. Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere. Numerous watersheds within [[Los Angeles County, California]] do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Abby |date=2013-01-03 |title=County seeks parcel fee to pay for projects to combat urban runoff |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/03/local/la-me-adv-stormwater-20130103 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development (LID)]] or [[green infrastructure]] techniques - known as [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)]] in the UK, and [[Water-sensitive urban design|Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)]] in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref name="EPA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA3"&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2009 |title=Reduce Runoff: Slow It Down, Spread It Out, Soak It In |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huO_NRn34GI |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, [[constructed wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association.

Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management. Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues.

The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff. [[Street sweeper|Street sweeping vacuums]] collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.&lt;ref name="EPA4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |title=Parking Lot and Street Cleaning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828022543/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |archive-date=2015-08-28 |website=National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Educational programs can also be an effective tool for managing urban runoff. Local businesses and individuals can have an integral role in reducing pollution in urban runoff simply through their practices, but often are unaware of regulations. Creating a productive discussion on urban runoff and the importance of effective disposal of household items can help to encourage environmentally friendly practices at a reduced cost to the city and local economy.&lt;ref&gt;
