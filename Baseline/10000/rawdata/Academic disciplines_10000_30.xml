'''Azal''' (אצל), or '''Azel''', is a location mentioned in the [[Book of Zechariah]] 14:5, in Bibles that use the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]] as the source for this verse. In Bibles that follow the Greek [[Septuagint]] ([[LXX]]) rendering, depending upon the source manuscript used, ''Azal'' is transcribed ''Jasol'' (ιασολ, pronounced "Yasol"), ''Jasod'' (a corruption of ''Jasol''), or ''Asael'' (ασαηλ):

{{quote|''And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto ''Azal'': yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of [[Uzziah]] king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].''|source={{Bibleverse||Zechariah|14:5|KJV}} [[King James Version]]}}

{{quote|''The valley between the hills will be filled in, yes, it will be blocked as far as ''Jasol'', it will be filled in as it was by the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah'',|source={{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=45&amp;bible_chapter=14|title=Zechariah 14:5|publisher=[[New Jerusalem Bible]]|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}}}

== Theories on location ==

No written work prior to the late 19th-century definitively identifies what, or where, Azal is or was. Most Bible commentators of the late 19th century considered it to be a place near [[Jerusalem]].  [[Cyril of Alexandria]] wrote in his commentary on the [[Book of Zechariah]], Chapter 14. that Azal was known to be “a town situated at the far point of the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Cyril | last=Alexandria | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lG_NF6CrjtcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=a+town+situated+at+the+far+point+of+the+mountain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPZjpAt7Ba&amp;sig=NvAQJgqzXKB8N7VcHP2l0YKIGcM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI--assLmXxwIVDJ2ICh1CYgRr#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20town%20situated%20at%20the%20far%20point%20of%20the%20mountain&amp;f=false | editor-last = Hill | editor-first = Robert C.| series = | title = Commentary on the Twelve Prophets, Volume 3 | at = pp. 259-60 | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, Palestinian [[geographer]] {{ill|Rabbbi Joseph Schwarz|he|יהוסף שוורץ}}&lt;ref name=Schwarz&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13342-schwarz-joseph|title=SCHWARZ, JOSEPH |date =1890|work =[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Azal was modern Azaria, situated a half mile southeast of the southernmost peak of the [[Mount of Olives]] (then called Mount Corruption).&lt;ref name=Palestine&gt;{{Cite report|last=Schwarz|first=Joseph|url=http://www.jewish-history.com/palestine/moriah.html|title=Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine |date =1850|work =Jewishhistory.com|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Orientalist and archaeologist [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], who identified the site of the ancient [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Gezer]] preserving the [[Mesha Stele]]'s inscriptions&lt;ref name=Gezer&gt;{{Cite report|last=Pelgrift|first=Henry|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/853/|title=The History of Excavations at Tel Gezer |date =January 12, 2016|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Schwarz was referring to [[al-Eizariya]], the traditional [[Bethany]] of New Testament times. However, al-Eizariya lies several kilometers due east of the [[Mount of Olives]], not a half mile southeast of it, as Schwarz claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clermont-Ganneau |first=Charles |date=1896 |title=Archaeological researches in Palestine during the years 1873–1874 |url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologicalre02cler |location=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |page=251-255; 275 |ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1873 and 1874, Clermont-Ganneau explored many tombs in a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which the peasants of [[Silwan]] called {{transl|ar|Wady Yasul}}. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Clermont-Ganneau proposed that Wady Yasul is Azal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clermont-Ganneau, ''Archaeological Researches in Palestine'', Vol. 1. pg. 420, 1899; Charles Clermont-Ganneau, Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, April 1874, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this valley is bordered on the west by the Jerusalem [[Peace Forest]] and the neighborhood of [[Talpiot]], on the north by the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood on the southern slope of the Hill of Evil Council, and on the south by the neighborhood of [[Jabel Mukaber]] on the ridge where the former UN headquarters sits. The mouth of the valley lies at the base of the southernmost summit of the Mount of Olives (Mount of Corruption). Its Hebrew name is {{transl|he|Nahal Atzal}} ({{lang|he|נחל אצל}}).

There is evidence that Clermont-Ganneau's theory and the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5 are correct. In 1984, Israeli geologists Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte identified the location of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives that is directly adjacent to both Wady Yasul (Nahal Atzal) and the area of the ancient King's Gardens at the juncture of the [[Hinnom]] and [[Kidron Valley]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wachs |first1= Daniel |last2= Levitte|first2= Dov |year= 1984|title=Earthquake Risk and Slope Stability in Jerusalem |journal=Environmental Geology and Water Sciences |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=183–186 |publisher= |doi=10.1007/BF02509912 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1323l6j20248l21/ |accessdate=November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wachs' and Levitte's discovery validates Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]]' account of an earthquake-caused landslide during King [[Uzziah]]'s reign blocking up the kings' gardens in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', book 9, chapter 10, paragraph 4, verse 225, William Whiston&lt;/ref&gt; It also accords with the ''LXX'' rendering of Zechariah 14:5, which states a valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. Additionally, the Israelis officially named this valley '''אצל''' (Atzal), which is the same Hebrew spelling of Azal ('''אצל''').

'''Background music''' refers to the various styles of [[music]] or [[soundscape]]s primarily intended to be passively listened to. It is not meant to be the main focus of an audience, but rather to supplement that which is meant to be focused upon. Music that is played at a low volume and is not the main focus of an audience is also referred to as background music. Traditional examples of background music include music played at various [[Party|social gatherings]] and music played in certain [[Retail|retail venues]]. It is also common to employ background music in various [[electronic media]] including [[film]], [[television]], [[video game]]s, and [[Internet]] [[video]]s such as [[video blog]]s.

==Psychological study==
The study of background music focuses on the impact of music with non-musical tasks, including changes in behavior in the presence of different types, settings, or styles of music.&lt;ref name=Kampfe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kampfe|first=J.|author2=Sedlmeier, P. |author3=Renkewitz, F. |title=The impact of background music on adult listeners: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychology of Music|date=8 November 2010|volume=39|issue=4|pages=424–448|doi=10.1177/0305735610376261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory settings, music can affect performance on cognitive tasks (memory, [[attention]], and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]), both positively and negatively. Used extensively as an [[advertising]] aid, music may also affect [[marketing strategies]], ad comprehension, and consumer choices.

===Effects on cognitive performance===

====Tasks music improves====
Participants who memorized [[foreign language]] words while listening to [[Baroque music]]  recalled an average of 8.7% more words than those who did not listen to music. The effect of music was stronger for less common words, and there was no effect of music on recall a week later.&lt;ref name="de Groot" /&gt;

The [[Mozart effect]] occurs when performance on cognitive tasks requiring [[spatial manipulations]] (such as a [[mental rotation]] task) improves after listening to fifteen minutes of [[Mozart]].&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rauscher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rauscher|first=Frances H.|author2=Shaw, Gordon L. |author3=Ky, Catherine N. |title=Music and spatial task performance|journal=Nature|date=14 October 1993|volume=365|issue=6447|pages=611–611|doi=10.1038/365611a0|pmid=8413624}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical mental rotation task, participants see two [[Stereoscopy|3D]] shapes drawn on paper, and then decide if they are different views of the same shape or different shapes. This comparison often requires mental rotation of the object. The Mozart effect is inconsistent when tested with musicians and non-musicians. Only non-musicians showed any improvement when given the mental rotation task before and after listening to Mozart.&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt; Musicians tend to process music using both [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]], whereas non-musicians use mostly their [[right hemisphere]]. Listening to Mozart increased arousal in the right hemisphere (active during mental rotation), and non-musicians may have performed better due to more right hemisphere activity.&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt;

[[Digit detection]] tasks require participants to monitor a stream of letters for two randomly placed digits, and [[attentional blink]] (the inability to detect the second visual target) may occur after the first digit is detected.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt; When accompanied by task-irrelevant mental activity, performance can actually improve on attentionally-demanding [[visual search]] tasks. Detection rates of the second digit were significantly higher when accompanied by music.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt; This suggests that background music may facilitate increased [[arousal]] or increased positive [[affective state]], leading to better attention. It is also possible that the music induces a more diffuse distribution of attention, so that participants can attend over a broader search that includes the second digit.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt;

A similar phenomenon, [[inattentional blindness]], refers to the tendency to miss a novel [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] when attending to other stimuli.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt; As a laboratory task, participants are instructed to attend to moving visual stimuli on a computer monitor while an "A" of a different color moves across the screen.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt; A simple auditory task required participants to listen for an occasional embedded tone amidst background music, and this attenuated the blindness to the "A". Participants were able to perform both tasks simultaneously at a higher rate than the [[visual monitoring]] alone, and engaged in fewer task-unrelated thoughts, suggesting that not all increases in task demand are equal. Music may fill a special role that leads to increased arousal without affecting concurrent task performance.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt;

====Tasks music impairs====
Though increased arousal from music listening may improve cognitive performance (possibly the process through which the Mozart effect occurs),&lt;ref name=Kampfe /&gt; the irrelevant sound effect (or [[irrelevant speech effect]])&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt; can also occur. When two concurrent sources of information compete for processing, the sources interfere with each other. For example, in advertisements, studies have shown that the presence of lyrics in background music can draw a consumer's attention away from the main point of the ad. Although it may seem like a nice supplement, background music can be a distraction from the intended message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Esther|last2=Lakshmann|first2=Arun|date=2017|title=Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=27|pages=35–48|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[serial recall]] tasks participants must recall (in the correct order) lists of digits or words. Music with a high degree of acoustic variation tends to inhibit performance on serial recall tasks by drawing on [[Cognitive resource theory|cognitive resources]].&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt;

When performing [[digit span]] tasks in the presence of music, participants must recall a string of digits of increasing length. Those completing the tasks in silence performed significantly better than those listening to music (it did not matter if the music was liked or disliked).&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt;

====Mixed effects and moderating factors====
In a [[verbal learning]] test that consisted of words and non-words, background music had no significant impact on test performance.&lt;ref name=Jancke /&gt; Participants studied with original excerpts in which tempo and [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (in or out of tune) were manipulated,  nondescript noise, and silence. While test performance did not differ across these conditions, stronger [[EEG]] readings were registered with consonant and fast music.&lt;ref name=Jancke /&gt; This suggests music may draw more cognitive resources, though increased [[cortical activation]] compensates to preserve task performance.&lt;ref name=Kampfe /&gt;

=====Musical variations=====
The nature of the background music, either [[vocal]] or [[instrumental]], and the perceived correctness of the music can change its effect on cognitive performance.

Working memory, and more specifically the [[phonological loop]] (memory process through which auditory information is rehearsed and stored for short-term recall), plays an integral role in [[Information processing|processing]] [[digit span]] tasks.&lt;ref name=Alley /&gt; In the presence of either vocal music or irrelevant speech, performance appears to suffer similarly with both, whereas listening to instrumental renderings of the same songs (or working in silence) tends to lead to better performance.&lt;ref name=Alley /&gt;

The presence of [[lyrics]] differentially affects performance depending on the nature of the task. Performance on verbal tests ([[reading comprehension]]) tends to improve with silence versus either vocal or instrumental music. On the other hand, [[math]] [[test performance]] is higher with vocal music than with instrumental. [[Logic]] performance (understanding [[flowcharts]] or diagrams) is higher with ''either'' vocal or instrumental versus silence.&lt;ref name=Avila /&gt; If music leads to a more aroused state, it appears to only improve performance when the music does not directly interfere with the task (e.g., ''lyrics'' interfere with ''verbal'' processing).&lt;ref name=Avila /&gt;

Expert musicians and non-musicians listened to either music played correctly, played with errors, or silence while performing a language-based task (evaluating grammar in given sentences).&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt; Both musicians and non-musicians performed worse while listening to incorrectly played music versus silence, but only musicians performed significantly worse in the presence of incorrect music versus correct music. With a [[Spatial visualization ability|visuo-spatial]] search task (locating differences between nearly identical images filled with [[geometric patterns]] and color), neither group was affected by the music conditions.&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt; Musicians were more attentive to the errors in the music, and their performance suffered more. Though music can be arousing and lead to higher cognitive performance, it can also be distracting.&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt;

=====Personality=====
The Cortical Arousal Theory suggests that background music may differentially impact cognitive performance based on certain [[personality psychology|personality]] traits.&lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt; Both [[Extraversion and introversion|introverts]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts]] tend to perform higher on immediate recall (recalling ideas from a story just read), delayed recall, and [[Stroop effect|Stroop]] tasks in silence versus popular lyrical music.&lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt; Introvert's performance suffered more than extravert's with highly arousing music, suggesting internal arousal through music can differentially affect cognitive performance.

Music provides a material rendering of self-identity; that is, it provides a material in and with which to identify identity. Music is a "mirror" that allows one to "see one's self" and serves as a repository of value or self-perception.&lt;ref&gt;DeNora, Tia. Music as a Technology of Self. La Jolla: Megan Turner, 4 Sept. 2013. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important aspects of an advertisement's music is the "musical fit," or the degree of congruity between cues in the ad and song content.&lt;ref name=OAKES&gt;{{cite journal|last=OAKES|first=STEVE|title=Evaluating Empirical Research into Music in Advertising: A Congruity Perspective|journal=Journal of Advertising Research|date=1 January 2007|volume=47|issue=1|page=38|doi=10.2501/S0021849907070055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements and music can be congruous or incongruous for both lyrical and instrumental music. The timbre, tempo, lyrics, genre, mood, as well as any positive or negative associations elicited by certain music should fit the nature of the advertisement and product.&lt;ref name=OAKES /&gt; For example, playing classical music in the background has been shown to increase the amount of money that people are willing to spend on a product, as it is associated with an "upmarket" image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002243591500055X|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = 10.1016/j.jretai.2015.06.001|first = Adrian C.|last = North|first2 = Lorraine P.|last2 = Sheridan|first3 = Charles S.|last3 = Areni|volume=92|pages=83–95|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product involvement refers to the degree of personal relevance and perceived purchase risk regarding a given product, while advertising involvement refers to the amount of attention directed toward the advertisement and its content.&lt;ref name=OAKES /&gt; Both types can be more cognitively (content-focused) or affectively (emotion-focused) oriented, changing the way in which background music interacts with advertisement viewing or listening.

====Recall====
When viewing 30-second TV ads containing background [[classical music]], recall was tested for [[brand]] name and message content.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt; Participants viewed an original commercial (for a fictional brand of soap) embedded in an episode of [[America’s Funniest Home Videos]]. The same commercial was paired with either familiar or unfamiliar classical music of a slow or fast tempo. Results revealed an inverted-U relationship between tempo and recall (faster tempo correlated with higher recall to a certain point, then recall began to suffer). This was only found when the ad contained familiar music, suggesting that familiarity [[Mediation (statistics)|mediates]] advertisement involvement.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt; This supports a resource-matching [[hypothesis]]:  message processing is maximized when the cognitive resources demanded match those available. As music speed increases, information density in the ad increases. As long as cognitive resources are not exceeded, ad processing more equally matches an increased state of arousal through the music.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt;

In real radio commercials, data reveal a different relationship when the whole stimulus is auditory.&lt;ref name=Oakes /&gt; Though a better match (higher congruity) between musical timbre and ad message led to higher recall, both slow and fast background music reduced content recall, with slower music leading to significantly lower performance than fast music.&lt;ref name=Oakes /&gt;

Background music can act as a peripheral [[persuasion]] cue, evoking emotional responses and positive attitudes toward both the advertisement and the brand. These emotional responses can also interfere with recall.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; Women were shown a TV commercial for a fictional brand of hair shampoo, and assigned either to a "cognitively involved" group (instructed to pay attention to the specifics of product quality and ratings), an "affectively involved" group (instructed to watch for the product's unique personality).&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; Popular music played in the background and facilitated recall only in the affective involvement group; it had a distracting effect with cognitive involvement.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; This suggests a differential effect of background music in commercials based on product involvement and types of processing.

====Intentions and attitudes====
Attention paid to the ad and brand, attitudes toward each, and [[purchase intentions]] were measured in response to fictional [[TV commercials]] that contained either culturally appropriate or inappropriate music.&lt;ref name=Lawani /&gt; Congruent product-music commercials (e.g., Asian music paired with Asian product) elicited significantly more favorable attitudes toward the product.&lt;ref name=Lawani /&gt;

Radio commercials, when paired with congruent music (rated in another experiment as fitting the product being advertised), show similar trends.&lt;ref name=Lavack /&gt; Congruent music elicits more positive attitudes toward the advertisement and brand in "high-cognition" ads (e.g., focuses on Rolex specifications) than in "low-cognition" ads (e.g., focuses on feelings accompanying a Rolex).&lt;ref name=Lavack /&gt; The musical fit differentially affected ad impact based on the type of commercial.

When background music fits radio ad content, but varies on tempo, style, and rhythm, participants formed different impressions of the brand and its endorser. With a slow [[piano]] [[ballad]], for example, participants perceived the endorser as more diligent and orderly than when he endorsed a product with [[rock music]]. Even given these different impressions, participants did not significantly change their general evaluation of the product.&lt;ref name=Zander /&gt; In all conditions there was a high degree of musical fit, but perceptions of brand and endorser can change separate from views toward the ad.&lt;ref name=Zander /&gt;

===Retail environment===

In a survey of shoppers at a suburban mall, both hedonic (pleasure) and utilitarian evaluations of a given shopping experience differed based on an interaction between retail density and the tempo of music playing in the mall. Shoppers are attracted to scenery, smells, and sounds; the more pleasant the shopper feels the more they tend to spend. Past research by Morrin showed that pleasant scents can enhance cognition and cause people to better remember the details of products.[20] Retail density (number of shoppers) was determined by the time of day and day of the week, while slow and fast music were played. A shopping experience can influence browsing behaviors and evaluations were highest with slow music and high density or fast music and low density.[20] This random survey lends support to a "schema incongruity theory" stating that more elaborate information processing occurs under mildly incongruous conditions. The incongruity between density and music tempo seems to create that condition.[20]

When participants viewed videos of interactions between a sales clerk and a shopper, slow and soothing music led to more negative evaluations toward the store and salesperson, if the sales pitch was weaker.[21] The type of music affected cognitive processing (slow music allowed for greater resources to be used in evaluating the sales pitch). Thus participants viewed a weaker sales pitch more critically, except when faster music drew more resources.[21] Musical fit also applies to retail situations. Regardless of the type of music, however, it needs to at least match the store environment and product to garner positive reactions.[21]

People who tend to do unplanned shopping tend to spend more when hear background music, people who have plan to shop tend to spend less even when there is music playing.

=== Historical devices ===
The 1964 3M [[Cantata 700]] played continuous and auto-reversing one of its large and proprietary [[magnetic tape]] cartridges, containing up to 26 hours of music. The [[Rowe Customusic]] was an endless tape cartridge player, loading simultaneous six C-type [[Fidelipac]] cartridges. The 1959 [[Seeburg 1000]] was a stack [[record player]], playing both sides continuous and repeating up to 1000 songs and up to 25 special 9" vinyl records with a 2" center bore at 16⅔ PRM.

==Types==

===Incidental music===
{{Main|Incidental music}}
Incidental music is music in a play, radio/TV program or some other form that is not primarily musical, adding atmosphere to the action. It can be dated back at least as far as Greek drama. A number of classical composers have written incidental music for various plays.

===Furniture music===
{{Main|Furniture music}}
The term ''furniture music'' was coined by [[Erik Satie]] in 1917. It fell into disuse when the composer died a few years later, and the genre was revived several decades later. Typical of furniture music are short musical passages, with an indefinite number of repeats.

===Elevator music===
{{Main article|Muzak}}
[[Elevator]] music (also [[Muzak]], piped music, or lift music) is a more general term indicating music that is played in rooms where many people come together (that is, with no intention whatsoever to listen to music), and during telephone calls when placed on hold. There is a specific ''sound'' associated with elevator music, usually involving themes from "soft" popular music or "[[light music|light]]" classical music being worked over by slow strings. This type of music was produced, for instance, by the [[Mantovani|Mantovani Orchestra]], and conductors like [[Franck Pourcel]] and [[James Last]], peaking in popularity around the 1970s.

The term can also be used for kinds of [[easy listening]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vSpqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|page=52|title=American Popular Music, Grades 5 – 8|author= Mark Ammons|publisher=Mark Twain Media|date= 6 Aug 2010|isbn=978-1-58037-983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[piano]] solo, [[jazz]] or [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music, or what are known as "[[beautiful music]]" radio stations.

This style of music is sometimes used to comedic effect in [[mass media]] such as [[film]], where intense or dramatic scenes may be interrupted or interspersed with such anodyne music while characters use an elevator. Some [[video game]]s have used music similarly: ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'' where a few elevator music-themed tracks are accessible on the in-game [[iPod]], as well as ''[[Rise of the Triad: Dark War]]''.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Some people can be deeply annoyed by piped music, and even find it spoils their enjoyment in recreation or drives them out of shops: Eight out of 10 people have left an establishment early because it was too noisy.&lt;ref name="Pipedown"&gt;See [http://www.pipedown.info/ Pipedown]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of societies, such as [[Pipedown (campaign)|Pipedown]],&lt;ref name="Pipedown"/&gt; that are dedicated to reducing its extent and intrusiveness.  The [[Good Pub Guide]] 2017 called for a ban on piped music in pubs, already the case in houses managed by the [[Samuel Smith Brewery]].

===Video game and blog music===
Background music (often abbreviated BGM) is the [[video game music|music in video games]] (sometimes written VGM) and music in websites.

===Internet delivered background music===
In recent years the proliferation of Internet delivered background music by such companies as [[Trusonic]] has gained traction.  This allows the retailer to instantly update music and messages which are deployed at the store level as opposed to using older [[compact disc]] and [[satellite]] technologies.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=={{anchor}}Background Non-music==
===Business audio===
'''Business audio''' refers to a type of service that provides audio content that is licensed for use in a commercial setting.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Business news can be one example. The term ''background music'' is another example. Providers of the latter include:
* [[Muzak Holdings LLC]]
* [[DMX (music)|DMX]]
* [[Playnetwork|PlayNetwork]]
* [[XM|XM for Business]]
* [[Music Choice]]
* [[Applied Media Technologies Corporation]], 
* Rock 300, 
* [[Trusonic]], and 
* Business Audio Plus

In the United States, the terms "elevator music" and "Muzak" are commonly used to refer to business audio services that provide background music in retail settings.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
Founded in 1934, [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]] was among the early background music providers. 

Business audio is produced off-site and delivered to the client via a number of methods including [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] satellite, [[Digital Audio Radio Service|SDARS]] satellite, [[coaxial cable]], [[FM radio]] [[subcarrier]], [[leased line]], [[internet]] [[broadband]], [[compact disc]], and [[Magnetic tape|tape]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Most audio content is licensed for personal and home use only. Business audio services allow clients to use audio content in public and commercial settings by paying appropriate royalties to performing rights organizations like [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[SESAC]] and [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Bailey: ''A new peptide synthesis.'' In: ''Nature.'' Band 164, Nummer 4177, November 1949, S.&amp;nbsp;889, {{PMID|15407090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerong"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Daniel Zerong Wang|Title=''Comprehensive Organic Name Reactions and Reagents''|Volume=1|Publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|PublicationPlace=Hoboken New Jersey|Year=2009|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;156–159|ISBN=978-0-471-70450-8|Date= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a method for the synthesis of a peptide from ''α''-amino acid-''N''-carboxylic acid anhydrides (NCAs) and [[Amino acid|amino acids]] or peptide esters.&lt;ref name="Zerong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;J.

The reaction can be carried out at low temperatures in organic solvents.&lt;ref name="Zerong" /&gt; The residues R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be organic groups or hydrogen atoms, R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the used amino acid or peptide ester:&lt;ref name="Zerong" /&gt;

== Reaction mechanism ==
The reaction mechanism is not known in detail. Supposingly, the reaction begins with a nucleophilic attack of the amino group on the [[Carbonyl group|carbonyl carbon]] of the anhydride group of the N-carboxylic acid anhydride ('''1'''). After an intramolecular proton migration, a 1,4-proton shift and the cleavage of carbon dioxide follows, resulting in the peptide bond in the final product ('''2'''):&lt;ref name="Zerong" /&gt;

==  Atom economy ==
The advantage in [[atom economy]] of using NCAs for peptide formation is that there is no need for a [[protecting group]] on the functional group reacted with the amino acid.&lt;ref name="NCASchutz"&gt;Ryoichi Katakai: ''Peptide Synthesis Using o-Nitrophenylsulfenyl N-Carboxy α-Amino Acid Anhydrides.'' In: ''The Journal of Organic Chemistry.'', Band 40, Nr. 19, 1975, S. 2697–2702, [[DOI:10.1021/jo00907a001]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Merrifield synthesis depends on the use of [[Tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]] and [[Benzyl group|Bzl]] [[Protecting group|protecting groups]], which need be removed after the reaction.&lt;ref name="Jakubke"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Hans-Dieter Jakubke|Title=''Peptide.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Bailey peptide synthesis, the free peptide is directly obtained after the reaction.&lt;ref name="NCASchutz" /&gt; However, unwanted and difficult to remove [[By-product|by-products]] may be formed.&lt;ref name="NCASchutz" /&gt; An ''N''-substitution of the NCA (for example, by an ''o''-nitrophenylsulfenyl group) can simplify the subsequent purification process, but on the other hand deteriorates the atom economy of the reaction. &lt;ref name="NCASchutz" /&gt; The synthesis of NCAs can be carried out by the Leuchs reaction&lt;ref&gt;Hans Rytger Kricheldorf: ''α-Aminoacid-N-Carboxy-Anhydrides and Related Heterocycles.

Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1987, S. 1–4, [[DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-71586-0]], {{ISBN|978-3-642-71588-4}} (Druck), {{ISBN|978-3-642-71586-0}} (Online).&lt;/ref&gt; or by the reaction of ''N''-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-amino acids with [[oxalyl chloride]]&lt;ref name="Schutzgruppenreaktion"&gt;D. Konopinska, I.Z. Siemion: ''Synthesis of N-Carboxy-α-amino Acid Anhydrides.'' In: ''Angewandte Chemie International Edition.''

In [[physical cosmology]], '''baryogenesis''' is the hypothetical physical process that took place during the [[Big Bang|early universe]] that produced [[baryon asymmetry|baryonic asymmetry]], i.e. the imbalance of [[matter]] ([[baryon]]s) and [[antimatter]] (antibaryons) in the observed [[universe]].

Baryogenesis theories are based on different descriptions of the interaction between fundamental particles. Two main theories are [[electroweak]] baryogenesis ([[standard model]]), which would occur during the [[electroweak epoch]], and the [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] baryogenesis, which would occur during or shortly after the [[grand unification epoch]]. [[Quantum field theory]] and [[statistical physics]] are used to describe such possible mechanisms.

Baryogenesis is followed by primordial [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]], when [[atomic nuclei]] began to form.

Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding antiparticle. Under the [[CPT symmetry|CPT theorem]], a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]]. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.

There are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total [[baryon number|baryonic number]] of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second point of view is preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

The second condition&amp;nbsp;– violation of CP-symmetry&amp;nbsp;– was discovered in 1964 (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].

In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;

|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

== Baryogenesis within the Standard Model (Electroweak Baryogenesis) ==
The [[Standard Model]] can incorporate baryogenesis, though the amount of net baryons (and leptons) thus created may not be sufficient to account for the present baryon asymmetry. This issue has not yet been determined decisively.

Baryogenesis within the Standard Model requires the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Higgs mechanism|symmetry breaking]] be a [[Phase transition#Ehrenfest classification|first-order]] [[phase transition]], since otherwise [[sphaleron]]s wipe off any baryon asymmetry that happened up to the phase transition, while later the amount of baryon non-conserving interactions is negligible.&lt;ref name=KRS1985&gt;

The [[phase transition]] [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]] breaks the [[P-symmetry]] spontaneously, allowing for [[CP-symmetry]] violating interactions to create [[C-symmetry|C-asymmetry]] on both its sides: quarks tend to accumulate on the broken phase side of the domain wall, while anti-quarks tend to accumulate on its unbroken phase side. This happens as follows:&lt;ref name="FarrarShaposhnikov1993"/&gt;

Due to [[CP-symmetry]] violating [[electroweak]] interactions, some amplitudes involving quarks are not equal to the corresponding amplitudes involving anti-quarks, but rather have opposite phase (see [[CKM matrix]] and [[Kaon]]); since [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] takes an amplitude to its complex conjugate, [[CPT-symmetry]] is conserved.

Though some of their amplitudes have opposite phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on [[flavor]] and on the [[Higgs field|Higgs]] [[Vacuum expectation value|VEV]] which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, and it turns out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.

Thus there is a net baryonic flux through the domain wall. Due to [[sphaleron]] transitions, which are abundant in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped off. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe off the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons.

In this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak interactions (i.e. the [[sphaleron]]) are responsible for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the domain wall is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.

== Matter content in the universe ==
{{see also|Baryon asymmetry}}

=== Baryon asymmetry parameter ===
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Background and research ==
In the past, researchers have studied how the absence or scarcity of books impact how a child's early [[literacy]] and language skills develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=M. D. R.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jonathan|last3=Sikora|first3=Joanna|last4=Treiman|first4=Donald J.|date=2010-06-01|title=Family scholarly culture and educational success: Books and schooling in 27 nations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562410000090|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–197|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/blog/2196_a_book_of_their_own_how_owning_books_affects_childrens_literacy|title=A book of their own: how owning books affects children's literacy|last=Poulton|first=Lizzie|date=July 7, 2010|website=Literacy Trust|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "book desert" came into regular use in the mid-2010s and the [[social enterprise]] [http://www.uniteforliteracy.com Unite for Literacy] is credited as having coined the term.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unite for Literacy created an operational definition of a book desert when they published the U.S. Book Desert Map: A geographic area (country, state, county, census tract) where it is predicted that a majority of homes have less than 100 printed books. In March 2014, James LaRue, director of the [[American Library Association]]'s Office for [[Intellectual Freedom]] and the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]], used the term in an issue of ''[[American Libraries]]'', where he described the term as applying to houses with 25 or fewer books in them and discussed ways to lessen or eradicate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/e-content/the-price-is-right-at-unite-for-literacy/|title=The Price Is Right at Unite for Literacy|last=LaRue|first=James|date=March 4, 2014|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, professors [[Susan B. Neuman]] and Naomi Moland published a study in ''[[Urban Education]]'', where they examined how the lack of printed reading material among low-income and poverty stricken neighborhoods impacts early childhood development and used the term to describe areas and homes with little access to written materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study built upon other research Neuman had conducted in 2001 on the same topic and the researchers found few stores in [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the focus areas of their research had print resources for children ages 0 through 18.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/where-books-are-nonexistent/491282/|title=The Children Who Grow Up in 'Book Deserts'|last=Wong|first=Alia|date=July 14, 2016|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those stores, many were [[dollar stores]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''The Atlantic'' reported that in 2015 Neuman and [[JetBlue|JetBlue Airways]] held an experiment to foster literacy by providing book vending machines in a low-income Washington D.C. neighborhood. Over 20,000 books were given away, prompting Neuman to conclude that the neighborhood's parents did care about their children's education but lacked "the resources to enable their children to be successful."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
Multiple factors are credited as contributing to the formation of book deserts, the most frequently highlighted of which tends to be poverty and low income. Other factors tend to include language and geography, as some areas lack access to bookstores or public or community school libraries that would provide books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wkbn.com/2016/07/29/warren-group-works-to-fight-book-desert-phenomenon/|title=Warren group works to fight 'book desert' phenomenon|last=Santelli|first=James|date=July 30, 2016|website=WKBN|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookselling|Book store]] closures due to [[bankruptcy]] or other financial difficulties are also occasionally cited as a contributing factor, when the closure leaves the area without a bookseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=drexel_main&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A286307818&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=drexel_main&amp;authCount=1|title=Store closures create US 'book deserts'|last=Gelles|first=David|date=April 14, 2012|work=The Financial Times|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unite Book Desert Map.jpg|thumb|US Book Desert map from Unite for Literacy]]

Unite for Literacy has developed a book desert map of the [[United States]] powered by [[Esri]]'s ArcGIS platform, which provides a visual presentation of the lack of books in the nation, states, counties and [[census tract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniteforliteracy.com/corp/esri&lt;/ref&gt; To create the map, Unite for Literacy performed a statistical analyses of data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the American Community Survey. Data used in the map includes the number of books in 4th graders' homes, average community income, ethnic diversity, geographic location and home language. Unite for Literacy unveiled the map during the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] America (CGI America) meeting held in Denver, Colorado, in June 2014.

|Latin=Ciliogenesis
}}
'''Ciliogenesis''' is defined as the building of the cell's [[Cellular antenna|antenna]] ([[primary cilium|primary cilia]]) or extracellular fluid mediation mechanism ([[motile cilia|motile cilium]]).&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;  It includes the assembly and disassembly of the cilia during the [[cell cycle]].  Cilia are important [[organelles]] of cells and are involved in numerous activities such as [[cell signaling]], processing developmental signals, and directing the flow of fluids such as mucus over and around cells.  Due to the importance of these cell processes, defects in ciliogenesis can lead to numerous human diseases related to non-functioning cilia.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishikawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = W. | year = 2011 | title = Ciliogenesis: building the cell's antenna | url = http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v12/n4/full/nrm3085.html | journal = Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 222–234 | doi=10.1038/nrm3085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciliogenesis may also play a role in the development of left/right [[handedness#Genetic factors|handedness]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brandler|first=WM|author2=Morris, AP |author3=Evans, DM |author4=Scerri, TS |author5=Kemp, JP |author6=Timpson, NJ |author7=St Pourcain, B |author8=Smith, GD |author9=Ring, SM |author10=Stein, J |author11=Monaco, AP |author12=Talcott, JB |author13=Fisher, SE |author14=Webber, C |author15=Paracchini, S |title=Common variants in left/right asymmetry genes and pathways are associated with relative hand skill.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e1003751|pmid=24068947|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003751|pmc=3772043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cilia formation ==
Ciliogenesis occurs through an ordered set of steps.&lt;ref name="steps"&gt;Sorokin, S. Centrioles and the formation of rudimentary cilia by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. ''J. Cell Biol.'' 15, 363–377 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  First, the [[basal bodies]] from centrioles must migrate to the surface of the cell and attach to the [[cell cortex|cortex]].  Along the way, the basal bodies attach to membrane [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] and the basal body/membrane vesicle complex fuses with the [[plasma membrane]] of the cell.  Fusion with the plasma membrane is likely what forms the membrane of the cilia.  The alignment of the forming cilia is determined by the original positioning and orientation of the basal bodies.  Once the alignment is determined, [[Axoneme|axonemal]] [[microtubules]] extend from the basal body and go beneath the developing ciliary membrane, forming the cilia.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Proteins must be synthesized in the cytoplasm of the cell and cannot be synthesized within cilia.  For the cilium to elongate, proteins must be selectively imported from the cytoplasm into the cilium and transported to the tip of the cilium by [[intraflagellar transport]] (IFT). Once the cilium is completely formed, it continues to incorporate new [[tubulin]] at the tip of the cilia.  However, the cilium does not elongate further, because older tubulin is simultaneously degraded.  This requires an active mechanism that maintains ciliary length.  Impairments in these mechanisms can affect the motility of the cell and cell signaling between cells.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

== Ciliogenesis types ==
Most cilia (also known as flagella) form as a separate compartment in the cell and the process is named [[Compartmentalized ciliogenesis]].  However,  the flagellum, a particular type of cilium found in the sperm is formed in a unique way, which is named [[Cytosolic ciliogenesis]] (also known as Cytoplasmic ciliogenesis), since, in this type of ciliogenesis, the [[cilium]] [[axoneme]] is formed in the [[cytoplasm]] or get exposed to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Shared and Distinct Mechanisms of Compartmentalized and Cytosolic Ciliogenesis. Avidor-Reiss T, Leroux MR. Curr Biol. 2015 Dec 7;25(23):R1143-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.001. http://0-resolver.ebscohost.com.carlson.utoledo.edu/openurl?sid=Entrez%3aPubMed&amp;id=pmid%3a26654377&amp;site=ftf-live&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ciliopathies ==
{{main|Ciliopathy}}
Ciliary defects can lead to a broad range of human diseases known as [[Ciliopathy|ciliopathies]] that are caused by mutations in ciliary proteins. Some common ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[hydrocephalus]], [[Polycystic liver disease|polycystic liver]] and [[Polycystic kidney disease|kidney disease]], and some forms of [[Retinopathy|retinal degeneration]]. Some research has shown that mutations in ciliary proteins can lead to other developmental and adult [[phenotypes]] such as [[nephronophthisis]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[Alström syndrome]], and [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]].&lt;ref name="ciliopathies"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Badano | first1 = J. | last2 = Mitsuma | first2 = N. | last3 = Beales | first3 = P. | last4 = Katsanis | first4 = N. | year = 2006 | title = The ciliopathies: An emerging class of human genetic disorders | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed&amp; | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 125–148 | doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115610 | pmid=16722803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Different cells use their cilia for different purposes, such as sensory signaling or the movement of fluid.  For this reason, when cilia form and how long they are differ from cell to cell.  The processes controlling ciliary formation, degradation, and length must all be regulated in some way to ensure that each cell is able to perform its necessary tasks.

=== Formation and removal ===

As the cell containing the cilium goes through the cell cycle, ciliogenesis must be regulated.  Cilia usually form during the [[G1 phase|G1]] of the cell cycle and disassemble during [[mitosis]].  It is not known why the cilia assemble and then disassemble, but it is believed that the presence of cilia may interfere with mitosis and, therefore, are removed before mitosis occurs.&lt;ref name="regulation"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = J. D. K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = Centrioles are freed from cilia by severing prior to mitosis | url = | journal = Cytoskeleton | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 425–430 | doi=10.1002/cm.20454| pmc = 2897710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells that have recently divided and are in the [[G0 phase|G0 stage]] of the cell cycle do not have cilia. During G1, the [[centriole|mother centriole]] attaches at the cell cortex and forms the cilium. During [[S-phase]], the mother centrioles and daughter centrioles (new centrioles) duplicate and new daughter centrioles are formed. Before mitosis can occur in most cells, the cilium is resorbed back into the cell. After the original cell divides into its two new cells, the cilia reform within the cells after the new cells enter G1.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

=== Length ===

Each type of cell has a specific optimal length for its cilia.  Therefore, the length of the cilia must be regulated to ensure optimal function of the cell.  Some of the same processes that are used to control to formation and removal of cilia (such as IFT) are thought to be used in the regulation of cilia length.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; The regulation of ciliary length is very important because it affects how the cell is able to use its cilia to move fluid over its surface or conduct cellular signaling.  Different ciliopathies can be caused by defects in ciliary length.  For instance, proteins that have been shown to cause Meckel–Gruber syndrome affect ciliary length control.&lt;ref name="Meckel"&gt;Tammachote, R. et al. Ciliary and centrosomal defects associated with mutation and depletion of the Meckel syndrome genes MKS1 and MKS3. ''Hum. Mol. Genet''. 18, 3311–3323 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the mechanisms that affect ciliary length control are not understood very well.  Until they are, it will be difficult to determine how defects in ciliary length may related to ciliopathic diseases and syndromes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6704">The '''Council on Social Work Education''' (CSWE) is a nonprofit national association representing more than 2,500 individual members, as well as graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in this country.

== History ==

The Summer School of Philanthropy was founded in 1898 by the Charity Organization Society of New York and was soon followed by additional training schools for social workers in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Philadelphia. In 1919 the Association of Training Schools for Professional Social Workers was established (later the American Association of Schools of Social Work, or AASSW). It established formal accrediting procedures in 1932, although the American Association of Medical Social Workers and the American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers had accrediting processes in place for their particular specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1953|volume=1|number=2|page=1|title=[Accrediting] historical development|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 AASSW's move to limit its membership to graduate schools caused state higher education institutions to form the National Association of Schools of Social Administration (NASSA). NASSA representatives felt that social worker shortages demanded a more generalist approach to social work education. The two systems, however, frustrated the education community and resulted in the removal of accreditation authority from both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M. J.|last=Monti|year=2002|volume=50|number=2|pages=12–15|title=50th anniversary: Assessing council history and future|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move led AASSW, NASSA, and others to establish the National Council on Social Work Education in 1946. This group studied the issues and produced ''Social Work Education in the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=E. V.|last2=Taylor|first2=A. L.|year=1951|title=Social work education in the United States|location=New York, NY|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report recommended that a sole organization be founded that would permit the many elements within the social work profession to participate in setting and maintaining accreditation criteria. Thus, AASSW and NASSA were dissolved, and CSWE was born in January 1952 with the following statement of purpose: “to promote the development of sound programs of social work education in the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=K. A.|year=2002|title=Council on Social Work Education: Its antecedents and first twenty years|location=Alexandria, Virginia|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen R. Wright, dean of the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, became CSWE’s first president, and Katherine A. Kendall, who had worked for the Children’s Bureau, the United Nations, and AASSW, was appointed CSWE’s executive secretary.

In the beginning CSWE accredited only master’s programs in social work, because a perception existed—although it was not universally supported—that preparation for professional social work practice was the province of master’s programs. CSWE also accredited Canadian master’s of social work programs until the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (now known as the Canadian Association for Social Work Education) took over accreditation of those programs in 1970. However, CSWE continued to accredit Canadian MSW programs on request until 1983.

In October 1961 the CSWE board adopted Social Welfare Content in Undergraduate Education as an aid to higher education institutions that wished to develop such programs. In 1973, CSWE issued accreditation standards covering content in the social work curriculum, staffing, and organization of social welfare programs at the undergraduate level, and in 1974, the National Commission on Accrediting formally authorized CSWE to accredit baccalaureate social work programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1973|volume=21|number=3|pages=13–16|title=Standards for the accreditation of baccalaureate degree programs in social work.|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CSWE|year=1974|volume=22|number=2|page=1|title=NCA and USOE approve move to baccalaureate program accreditation|work=Social Work Education Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issued a revised curriculum policy statement in 1982 that included curriculum policy for BSW programs (CSWE, 1982). The CSWE Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards were last revised in 2008. Because CSWE’s focus has been on the quality of education for individuals intending to engage in professional social work practice, it never has accredited social work programs at the associate’s or doctoral level.

The CSWE is the only organization that provides accreditation for all online CSWE programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was originally based in New York City, moving to Washington, DC, in 1984 and to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1990.

==Conferences==
In September 2013, Darla Coffey, CSWE President, organized the first White House Briefing for Social Work Education coordinated through the [[Office of Public Liaison|White House Office of Public Engagement]]. Presentations were given by federal officials from the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''Election law''' is a discipline falling at the juncture of [[constitutional law]] and [[political science]]. It researches "the politics of law and the law of politics". The conceptual knowledge behind election law focuses on who votes, when that person can vote, and the construction behind the tabulated totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/lf/lfa/lfa03/lfa03c|title=Electoral Laws —|website=aceproject.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
Some of the questions that are addressed by election law are:

* Which people are [[Suffrage|entitled to vote]] in an [[election]] (e.g. age, residency or literacy requirements, or [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]), and the procedures by which such persons must [[voter registration|register to vote]] or present identification in order to vote
* Which people are entitled to hold office (for example, age, residency, birth or citizenship requirements), and the procedures [[candidate]]s must follow to appear on the ballot (such as the formatting and filing of [[nominating petition]]s) and rules governing [[write-in candidate]]s
* The rules about what subjects may be submitted to a direct popular vote through a [[referendum]] or plebiscite, and the rules that governmental agencies or citizen groups must follow to place questions on the ballot for public consideration
* The framework by which [[political parties]] may organize their internal government, and how they select candidates to run for political office (e.g. [[primary election]]s)
* The financing of elections (e.g. contribution limits, rules for [[public financing of elections]], the public disclosure of contributors, and rules governing [[interest group]]s other than a candidate's campaign organization)
* The requirements for creating districts which elect representatives to a legislative assembly (examples include [[congressional district]]s, [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] or wards within a municipality)
* What restrictions are placed on campaign advocacy (such as rules on anonymous or [[false advertising]])
* How votes are cast at an election (including whether to use a paper [[ballot]], or some other form of recording votes such as a mechanical [[voting machine]] or [[electronic voting]] device, and how information is presented to voters on the ballot or device)
* How votes are counted at an election, recounts, and election challenges
* Whether, and how, voters or candidates may file legal actions in a [[court|court of law]] or administrative agency to enforce their rights or contest the outcome of an election
* Definition of [[electoral fraud]] and other [[crime]]s against the electoral system
* The sources of election law (for example, constitutions, national statutes, state statutes, or judicial decisions) and the interplay between these sources of law

== Sources of election law ==

== Regimes in comparative law ==

=== France ===

The French electoral code addresses most of the elections. However, other texts frame this material for special elections. Thus the Constitution but fixed some general basic provisions concerning the presidential election, the legislative and senatorial elections.

For litigation election, the court depends on the concerned election. The Constitutional Council is responsible for the most important elections: presidential elections and senatorial elections or referendums. In contrast, to the municipal or district elections the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, then the appeal is to the State Council. Finally, for the regional and European elections, the Council of State which has jurisdiction at first and last resort.

In decisions on electoral matters, the law takes into account the results: if an essential principle is violated, the election is canceled but if fraud is "classic" (ballot stuffing, failure to register as voters, vote the dead ...) but the election was won (after counting of ballots invalidated) with a large or very large lead, the judge then cancels rarely the result.&lt;ref&gt;On the other side, opposite judgement comes when the participation of the lists has resulted in an imbalance, also because the deviation of the votes between the two clusters is less than one thousand ballotts: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= La partecipazione (viziata) delle liste produce uno squilibrio nel voto|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309068}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
The Italian Constitution fixes some general basic provisions concerning the legislative elections.
Electoral disputes in Italy are complex because they are divided between several court orders. For example, with regard to the dispute concerning registration of candidates for ballots or litigation election, the administrative court has jurisdiction. For eligibility and disfranchisement, the judge is the ordinary tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;"A principle of separation of powers ( ... ) is the rationale of the law ( ... ) which ousts the administrative courts from ineligibility dispute": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Il giudicato civile in materia elettorale preclude l'azione popolare davanti al Tar|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298285}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a fraud is proven by the judge, it does not cancel necessarily the elections,&lt;ref&gt;The faults, as null and void, cannot justify a reversal "by forfeit" of the electoral outcome: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Elezioni Molise: gestione incerta fino all'annullamento definitivo|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298439}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they think that the result of election without the fraud would not have been identical. The survival of the acts already performed by the elected organs would seem solved by abundant case law that protects innocent trust of third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = L'incandidabilità di un eletto travolge il consiglio regionale abruzzese (e ripropone gli interrogativi molisani)|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89310220}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- please describe here USA election law --&gt;

=== {{UK}} ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], election law is legislated for by The [[Houses of Parliament]]. The statutory governance of UK Election law comes from acts of parliament such as the [[Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011]]. The Electoral Commission's mandate and establishment was set out in the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process.

The [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] made a number of improvements to electoral registration, improving the security arrangements for absent voting, allowing observers to attend elections and a major change in reducing the minimum age for candidates at UK parliamentary elections. It also introduced the performance standards regime for electoral services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6528">{{Distinguish|Euphemism}}
'''Euphuism''' is a peculiar mannered style of English [[prose]]. It takes its name from a prose romance  by [[John Lyly]]. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as [[antitheses]], [[alliteration]]s, repetitions and  [[rhetorical question]]s. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed. Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the [[Elizabethan]] court.

==''Euphues'' (1580)==
[[File:Campaspe.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'' by John Lily, 1584]]

"Euphues" is the Greek for "graceful, witty". [[John Lyly]] published the works ''[[Euphues (1578)|Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit]]'' (1578) and ''Euphues and his England'' (1580). Both works illustrated the intellectual fashions and favourite themes of Renaissance society&amp;mdash;in a highly artificial and mannered style. The plots are unimportant, existing merely as structural elements on which to display conversations, discourses and letters mostly concerning the subject of love. Its essential features had already appeared in such works as [[George Pettie]]'s ''A Petite Pallace of Pettie his pleasure'' (1576), in [[sermon]] literature, and Latin tracts. Lyly perfected the distinctive rhetorical devices on which the style was based.

==Principles==
The euphuistic sentence followed principles of balance and antithesis to their extremes, purposely using the latter regardless of sense. John Lyly set up three basic structural principles:
#phrases of equal length that appear in succession;
#the balance of key verbal elements in successive sentences;
#the correspondence of sounds and syllables, especially between words that are already balanced against each other.

==Examples==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is virtue, yea virtue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the base-born noble, the subject a sovereign, the deformed beautiful, the sick whole, the weak strong, the most miserable most happy. There are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and reason; the one commandeth, and the other obeyeth: these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, neither age abolish". (''Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit'')
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (''Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Can any treasure in this transitory pilgrimmage be of more value than a friend? In whose bosom thou mayest sleep secure without fear, whom thou mayest make partner of all thy secrets without suspicion of fraud, and partaker of all thy misfortune without mistrust of fleeting. Who will account thy bale his bane, thy mishap his misery, the pricking of thy finger the piercing of his heart" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"How frantic are those lovers which are carried away with the gay glistering of the fine face? The beauty whereof is parched with the summer's blaze and chipped with the winter's blast: which is of so short continuance, that it fadeth before one perceive it flourish". (Euphues' after-dinner speech to the 'coy' Neapolitan ladies on whether the qualities of the mind or the composition of the man are more worthy).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Time hath weaned me from my mother's teat, and age rid me from my father's correction". (Lucilla, considering her father's reaction in abandoning her fiance Philanthus for Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A sharp sore hath a short cure" (Euphues)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As they be hard to be won without trial of great faith, so are they hard to be lost without great cause of fickleness". (Euphues to Lucilla on the quality of 'fervency' in women).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But alas Euphues, what truth can there be found in a traveller? What stay in a stranger? Whose words and bodies both watch but for a wind, whose feet are ever fleeting, whose faith plighted on the shore, is turned to perjury when they hoist sail". (Lucilla to Euphues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
Many critics did not appreciate Lyly's deliberate excesses. [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]] castigated his style. 

Lyly's style, however, influenced Shakespeare, who satirised it in speeches by Polonius in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the florid language of the courtly lovers in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''; Beatrice and Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' also made use of it, as did Richard and Lady Anne in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It was taken up by the Elizabethan writers [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Thomas Lodge]] and [[Barnabe Rich]]. [[Walter Scott]] satirised it in the character of Sir Piercie Shafton in ''The Monastery'', while [[Charles Kingsley]] defended ''Euphues'' in ''Westward Ho!''.

==Contemporary equivalents in other languages==
Euphuism was not particular to Britain, or a manifestation of some social structure and artistic opportunity unique to that country. There were equivalents in other major European languages, each of which was called by a different name: [[culteranismo]] in [[Spain]], [[Giovan Battista Marino|Marinismo]] in [[Italy]], and [[préciosité]] in [[France]], for example.

'''Evolutionary anthropology''' is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominids]] and non-hominid [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]]. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology are:

* [[Human evolution]] and [[anthropogeny]].
* [[Paleoanthropology]] and [[paleontology]] of both human and non-human primates.
* [[Primatology]] and primate [[ethology]].
* The [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[human behavior]].
* The [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] of humans.
* The [[archaeological]] study of human technology and change over time and space.
* [[Human evolutionary genetics]] and changes in the [[human genome]] over time.
* The [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[neuroanthropology]] of human and primate cognition, culture and actions and abilities.
* [[Human behavioural ecology]] and the interaction of humans and the environment.
* Studies of human [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors.

Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], primatology, and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of biological evolution generally concern the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporate [[cultural transmission]] models. Note that cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution, and that human culture involves the transmission of cultural information, which behaves in ways quite distinct from [[human biology]] and [[genetics]]. The study of cultural change is increasingly performed through [[cladistics]] and genetic models.

[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Thermophile]]s, a type of extremophile, produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]
An '''extremophile''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|extremus}}'' meaning "extreme" and Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|philiā}}'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}}) meaning "love") is an [[organism]] that thrives in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment|extreme conditions]] that are detrimental to most [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that [[microbial life]] has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to [[complex organisms]]. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Rover Launches - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as [[polyextremophile]]s. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 351–359 | pmid=10319455 | last1 = Marteinsson | first1 = VT | last2 = Birrien | first2 = JL | last3 = Reysenbach | first3 = AL | last4 = Vernet | first4 = M | last5 = Marie | first5 = D | last6 = Gambacorta | first6 = A | last7 = Messner | first7 = P | last8 = Sleytr | first8 = UB | last9 = Prieur | first9 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]]. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Ajar Nath|last2=Verma|first2=Priyanka|last3=Kumar|first3=Murugan|last4=Pal|first4=Kamal K.|last5=Dey|first5=Rinku|last6=Gupta|first6=Alka|last7=Padaria|first7=Jasdeep Chatrath|last8=Gujar|first8=Govind T.|last9=Kumar|first9=Sudheer|date=2014-05-31|title=Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India|journal=Annals of Microbiology|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=611–629|doi=10.1007/s13213-014-0897-9|issn=1590-4261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms===
; [[Acidophile (organisms)|Acidophile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 3 or below

; [[Alkaliphile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 9 or above

; [[Anaerobe]]: An organism that does not require [[oxygen]] for growth such as ''[[Spinoloricus cinzia]]''. Two sub-types exist: [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobe]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]. A facultative anaerobe can tolerate anaerobic and aerobic conditions; however, an obligate anaerobe would die in the presence of even trace levels of oxygen

; [[Cryptoendolith]]: An organism that lives in microscopic spaces within rocks, such as pores between aggregate grains; these may also be called [[endolith]], a term that also includes organisms populating fissures, [[aquifer]]s, and faults filled with groundwater in the deep subsurface

; [[Halophile]]: An organism requiring at least 0.2[[molarity|M]] concentrations of salt ([[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]) for growth&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchioli, R. &amp; Thomas, T. 2000. Extremophiles. In: J. Lederberg. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Microbiology, Second Edition, Vol. 2, pp. 317–337. Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Hyperthermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures above 80&amp;nbsp;°C, such as those found in hydrothermal systems

; [[Hypolith]]: An organism that lives underneath rocks in cold deserts

; [[Lithoautotroph]]: An organism (usually bacteria) whose sole source of [[carbon]] is [[carbon dioxide]] and exergonic inorganic [[oxidation]] ([[chemolithotrophs]]) such as ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]''; these organisms are capable of deriving energy from reduced mineral compounds like [[pyrite]]s, and are active in [[geochemical cycle|geochemical cycling]] and the weathering of parent [[bedrock]] to form soil

; [[Metallotolerant]]: Capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as [[copper]], [[cadmium]], [[arsenic]], and [[zinc]]; examples include ''[[Ferroplasma]] sp.,'' ''[[Cupriavidus metallidurans]]'' and [[GFAJ-1]]&lt;ref name='refute'&gt;{{cite news | title = Studies refute arsenic bug claim | date = 9 July 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18770964 | work = BBC News | accessdate =10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= GFAJ-1 Is an Arsenate-Resistant, Phosphate-Dependent Organism |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1218455 |accessdate =10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1218455 |pmid=22773139 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=467–70 |last1=Erb |first1=Tobias J. |last2=Kiefer |first2=Patrick |last3=Hattendorf |first3=Bodo |last4=Günther |first4=Detlef |last5=Vorholt |first5=Julia A.|author5-link=Julia Vorholt|bibcode = 2012Sci...337..467E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Absence of Detectable Arsenate in DNA from Arsenate-Grown GFAJ-1 Cells |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1219861 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1219861 |pmid=22773140 |pmc=3845625 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=470–3 |last1=Reaves |first1=Marshall Louis |last2=Sinha |first2=Sunita |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Joshua D. |last4=Kruglyak |first4=Leonid |last5=Redfield |first5=Rosemary J.|arxiv = 1201.6643 |bibcode = 2012Sci...337..470R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Oligotroph]]: An organism capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments

; [[Osmophile]]: An organism capable of growth in environments with a high sugar concentration

; [[Piezophile]]: Also referred to as [[barophile]], is an organism that lives optimally at high [[pressure]]s such as those deep in the ocean or underground;&lt;ref name="DworkinFalkow2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Martin|last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-25476-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; common in the deep terrestrial subsurface, as well as in [[oceanic trench]]es. Piezophilic organisms live under conditions of extreme pressure. High pressures can cause proteins to fold into themselves. Piezophiles have less large bulky amino acids that would take up space and prevent the other amino acids from coming close enough to create the reinforced area around the core.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Lewis|  first2=Hunter|last3=Trejo| first3=Eric| last4=Winston| first4=Vern| last5=Evilia|first5=Caryn| title=Protein Adaptations in Archaeal Extremophiles|journal=Archaea|volume=2013| url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2013/373275/|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2013/373275|pmid=24151449|pmc=3787623|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Polyextremophile: A '''polyextremophile''' (faux Ancient Latin/Greek for 'affection for many extremes') is an organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category

; [[Psychrophile]]/Cryophile: An organism capable of survival, growth or reproduction at temperatures of -15&amp;nbsp;°C or lower for extended periods; common in cold soils, [[permafrost]], [[polar ice]], cold ocean water, and in or under alpine snowpack. Psychrophilic organisms live in environments at temperature below -15&amp;nbsp;°C. Low temperatures cause the energy within proteins to slow, which prevents them from functioning.  Their proteins have adapted their amino acid composition to live in  cold conditions. They have a high amount of [[glycine]] amino acids, which small size allows for more flexibility within the protein once it is folded. Psychrophiles also have a low concentration of charged amino acids, hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids, and proline residues. The low amount of charged amino acids reduces the amount of interactions between them, while the reduced amount of hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids allows the non-polar core of the protein to be smaller. Psychrophilic proteins have a small amount of [[proline]] amino acids because they cause a rigid structure. These adaptations allow psychrophilic proteins to be more flexible so they do not freeze under cold conditions.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms resistant to high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation

; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45–122&amp;nbsp;°C. Normally high temperatures cause proteins to unfold and prevent them from functioning; thermophilic proteins have adapted their proteins to cope with these conditions. They have a higher amount of [[cysteine]] amino acids, which form [[disulfide bond]]s once the protein has folded. These disulfide bonds cause the protein to fold up tighter and become more rigid. They also have more charged amino acids, both positive and negative, that interact with each other to increase how rigid the protein is. When proteins become more rigid they are less likely to unfold due to high temperature. Even one extra disulfide bond can raise the temperature at which the protein folds by 6&amp;nbsp;°C. These adapted proteins allow thermophilic extremophiles to survive at high temperatures.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Thermoacidophile]]: Combination of [[thermophile]] and [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] that prefer temperatures of 70–80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH between 2 and 3

; [[Xerophile]]: An organism that can grow in extremely dry, desiccating conditions; this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the [[Atacama Desert]]
&lt;!--; [[GFAJ-1]]: An [[organism]] in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that can tolerate extreme levels of [[arsenic]], but [[GFAJ-1]] can go a step further. When starved of [[phosphorus]], it can incorporate [[arsenic]] into its [[DNA]] and continue growing.--&gt;

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]]. Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[solar physics]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.

For example, analogous deserts of [[Antarctica]] are exposed to harmful [[UV radiation]], low temperature, high salt concentration and low mineral concentration. These conditions are similar to those on [[Mars]]. Therefore, finding viable microbes in the subsurface of Antarctica suggests that there may be microbes surviving in [[Endolith|endolithic communities]] and living under the Martian surface. Research indicates it is unlikely that Martian microbes exist on the surface or at shallow depths, but may be found at subsurface depths of around 100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Wynn-Williams|first1=D.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of [[prokaryotic cell]]s is essential for successful growth under [[hypergravity]]. The research has implications on the feasibility of [[panspermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |website=National Geographic- Daily News|publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru |author2=Hirokazu Shimoshige, Mikiko Tsudome, Sada-atsu Mukai, Robert W.

On 29 April 2013, scientists at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], funded by [[NASA]], reported that, during [[spaceflight]] on the [[International Space Station]], [[microbes]] seem to adapt to the [[space environment]] in ways "not observed on Earth" and in ways that "can lead to increases in growth and [[virulence]]".&lt;ref name="PLos-20130429"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim W |title=Spaceflight Promotes Biofilm Formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa |date=29 April 2013 |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=e6237 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062437 |pmid=23658630 |pmc=3639165 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...862437K |author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |last3=Young |last4=Shong |last5=Marchand |last6=Chan |last7=Pangule |last8=Parra |last9=Dordick |last10=Plawsky |last11=Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2014, scientists announced that numerous [[microbes]], like ''[[Tersicoccus phoenicis]]'', may be resistant to methods usually used in [[Cleanroom|spacecraft assembly clean rooms]]. It's not currently known if such resistant microbes could have withstood [[Interplanetary spaceflight|space travel]] and are present on the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] now on the planet Mars.&lt;ref name="NAT-20140519"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madhusoodanan |first=Jyoti |title=Microbial stowaways to Mars identified |url=https://www.nature.com/news/microbial-stowaways-to-mars-identified-1.15249 |date=19 May 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15249 |accessdate=23 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of [[microorganism]]s living half a mile below the ice of [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="NAT-20140820"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fox |first=Douglas |title=Lakes under the ice: Antarctica's secret garden |url=https://www.nature.com/news/lakes-under-the-ice-antarctica-s-secret-garden-1.15729 |date=20 August 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=512 |issue=7514 |pages=244–246 |doi=10.1038/512244a |accessdate=21 August 2014 |bibcode = 2014Natur.512..244F |pmid=25143097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRB-20140820"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mack |first=Eric |title=Life Confirmed Under Antarctic Ice; Is Space Next? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2014/08/20/life-confirmed-under-antarctic-ice-is-space-next/ |date=20 August 2014 |website=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=21 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2015, scientists from [https://www.cnr.it/en CNR-National Research Council] of Italy reported that [[Sulfolobus solfataricus|''S.soflataricus'']] was able to survive under Martian radiation at a wavelength that was considered extremely lethal to most bacteria. This discovery is significant because it indicates that not only bacterial spores, but also growing cells can be remarkably resistant to strong UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastascusa|first1=V.|last2=Romano|first2=I.|last3=Di Donato|first3=P.|last4=Poli|first4=A.|last5=Della Corte|first5=V.|last6=Rotundi|first6=A.|last7=Bussoletti|first7=E.|last8=Quarto|first8=M.|last9=Pugliese|first9=M.|last10=Nicolaus|first10=B.|title=Extremophiles Survival to Simulated Space Conditions: An Astrobiology Model Study|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|date=9 January 2015|volume=44|issue=3|pages=231–237|doi=10.1007/s11084-014-9397-y|pmid=25573749|bibcode=2014OLEB...44..231M|pmc=4669584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that [[endospore]]s of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28&amp;nbsp;m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barney|first1=Brandon L.|last2=Pratt|first2=Sara N.|last3=Austin|first3=Daniel E.|title=Survivability of bare, individual Bacillus subtilis spores to high-velocity surface impact: Implications for microbial transfer through space|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=June 2016|volume=125|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.02.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063315300088|bibcode=2016P&amp;SS..125...20B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells/gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2047 Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until recently [[boron]] tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of ''Bacillus boroniphilus'', borophiles came into discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahmed| first1 = Iftikhar| last2 = Yokota| first2 = Akira| last3 = Fujiwara| first3 = Toru| year = 2006| title = A novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, Bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth | url = | journal = Extremophiles | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 217–224 | doi = 10.1007/s00792-006-0027-0 | pmid = 17072687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.

== Industrial uses ==
The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&amp;nbsp;°C to over 94&amp;nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA modifying enzymes such as ''[[Taq polymerase|Taq]]'' DNA polymerase and some ''[[Bacillus]]'' enzymes used in clinical diagnostics and starch liquefaction are produced commercially by several biotechnology companies.&lt;ref name= AnitoriRP&gt;{{cite book | author= Anitori, RP (editor) | year=2012 | title=Extremophiles: Microbiology and Biotechnology | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-98-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell's chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnsborg | first1 = O | last2 = Eldholm | first2 = V | last3 = Håvarstein | first3 = LS. | year = 2007 | title = Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function | url = | journal = Res Microbiol | volume = 158 | issue = 10| pages = 767–78 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 | pmid = 17997281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  ''D. radiodurans'' is competent to perform [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK. | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–83 | pmid = 5303325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M | pmc=285920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.  The extreme thermophilic bacterium ''Thermus thermophilus'' and other related ''Thermus'' species are also capable of genetic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koyama | first1 = Y | last2 = Hoshino | first2 = T | last3 = Tomizuka | first3 = N | last4 = Furukawa | first4 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Genetic transformation of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus and of other Thermus spp | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 166 | issue = 1| pages = 338–40 | pmid = 3957870 | pmc=214599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Halobacterium volcanii]]'', an extreme halophilic ([[salinity|saline]] tolerant) archaeon, is capable of natural genetic transformation.  Cytoplasmic bridges are formed between cells that appear to be used for DNA transfer from one cell to another in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenshine | first1 = I | last2 = Tchelet | first2 = R | last3 = Mevarech | first3 = M. | year = 1989 | title = The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium | url = | journal = Science | volume = 245 | issue = 4924| pages = 1387–9 | pmid = 2818746 | doi=10.1126/science.2818746|bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1387R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' and ''[[Sulfolobus acidocaldarius]]'' are hyperthermophilic archaea. Exposure of these organisms to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induces species-specific cellular aggregation.&lt;ref name=Frols2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fröls | first1 = S | last2 = Ajon | first2 = M | last3 = Wagner | first3 = M | last4 = Teichmann | first4 = D | last5 = Zolghadr | first5 = B | last6 = Folea | first6 = M | last7 = Boekema | first7 = EJ | last8 = Driessen | first8 = AJ | last9 = Schleper | first9 = C et al. | year = 2008 | title = UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation | url = | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 70 | issue = 4| pages = 938–52 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06459.x | pmid = 18990182  | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ajon2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajon | first1 = M | last2 = Fröls | first2 = S | last3 = van Wolferen | first3 = M | last4 = Stoecker | first4 = K | last5 = Teichmann | first5 = D | last6 = Driessen | first6 = AJ | last7 = Grogan | first7 = DW | last8 = Albers | first8 = SV | last9 = Schleper | first9 = C. et al. | year = 2011 | title = UV-inducible DNA exchange in hyperthermophilic archaea mediated by type IV pili | url = | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 807–17 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07861.x | pmid = 21999488  | displayauthors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UV-induced cellular aggregation of ''S. acidocaldarius'' mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency.&lt;ref name=Ajon2011 /&gt;  Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude.

It has also been suggested that DNA transfer in ''Sulfolobus'' may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

Extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) might be involved in DNA transfer between different hyperthermophilic archaeal species.&lt;ref name=Gaudin_viral&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extracellular membrane vesicles harbouring viral genomes|journal=Environ Microbiol|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1167–75|year=2014|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12235|pmid=24034793|author=Gaudin M, Krupovic M, Marguet E, Gauliard E, Cvirkaite-Krupovic V, Le Cam E, Oberto J, [[Forterre P]]|last2=Krupovic|last3=Marguet|last4=Gauliard|last5=Cvirkaite-Krupovic|last6=Le Cam|last7=Oberto|last8=Forterre}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that both plasmids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hyperthermophilic archaea produce membrane vesicles that can transfer DNA|journal=Environ Microbiol Rep|year=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=109–16|pmid=23757139|author=Gaudin M, Gauliard E, Schouten S, Houel-Renault L, Lenormand P, Marguet E, Forterre P.|doi=10.1111/j.1758-2229.2012.00348.x|last2=Gauliard|last3=Schouten|last4=Houel-Renault|last5=Lenormand|last6=Marguet|last7=Forterre}}&lt;/ref&gt; and viral genomes&lt;ref name="Gaudin_viral" /&gt; can be transferred via MVs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Floor hockey''' is a family of indoor [[hockey]] games. 5 variations exist: three variations in the style of [[ice hockey]], and the other two in the style of [[bandy]], one of which is called [[floorball]] in English speaking regions.
Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as [[roller sports]] under the title of [[roller hockey]]. [[Quad hockey]] uses [[quad skates]] and looks similar to bandy, while [[inline hockey]] uses [[inline skates]] and is of the ice hockey variation.
All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a
curved end.&lt;ref&gt;“Floor Hockey Rules,” http://sportsvite.com/sports/FloorHockey/rules{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floor hockey games differ from [[street hockey]] in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;{{cite book|page=158|chapter=floor hockey|title=Webster's Sports Dictionary|publisher=G&amp;G Merriam Company|year=1976|location=Springfield, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bandy in a training format known as [[dryland training]].

==History==
Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Samuel Perry Jacks]], better known as "Sam Jacks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportshall.ca/stories.html?proID=491&amp;catID=all&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in [[Toronto]]. His achievement was later recognized by the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. “Ice Hockey”&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of [[ringette]] was introduced as a sport in the Winter [[Special Olympics]] in 1932.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1970, the [[Special Olympics]] added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floor Hockey: Sport History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322110631/http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|archive-date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.specialolympicspa.org/sportslive/FloorHockey.php|publisher= Special Olympics – Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Ball Hockey Association]] (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey.&lt;ref&gt;“Canadian Ball Hockey Association History,” The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt;  The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division.&lt;ref&gt;“CBHA Who We Are”, The Canadian Ball Hockey Association, http://cbha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States.

==Equipment==

Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor [[Puck (sports)|puck]], a ring made of felt or other material ( [[Gym Ringette]] ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard [[ice hockey]], field hockey or [[bandy]] sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary.

==Variations==

One variation, especially popular in [[Europe]], is [[floorball]]. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted.

Another variation, [[cosom hockey]], uses plastic sticks and pucks, while [[gym ringette]] uses circular rings and sticks with no blade.

[[Power hockey]] is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs.
Knee pads are required for the goal keeper

== Rules ==

Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code.

With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period.

A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team.

The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into overtime in order to determine a winner.  Overtime rules vary, but typically include [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]].

Penalties for illegal actions are enforced.  A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a [[power play (sport)|power play]], but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions:
*  Tripping – Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall
*  Hooking – Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player’s forward progress by pulling him or her back
*  Slashing – Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body
*  Interference – Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck
*  High Sticking – Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist
*  Pushing Down – Using the stick to push an opponent down
*  Checking from behind – Hitting a player from behind

Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,&lt;ref name="nirsa.org"&gt;“NIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,” Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, http://www.nirsa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Sports/IntramuralRules/im_floorhockey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">'''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''' was an Italian artistic movement active in [[Venice]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in the years following [[Second World War|WWII]] (1946 to 1950). It is considered to be part of the post-cubism movement.

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti" was founded in September-October 1946 with the name ''Nuova Secessione Artistica Italiana'' (New Italian Artistic Secession). The first manifesto was published on 1 October 1946 in [[Venice]]. It was written by Giuseppe Marchiori and signed by [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Renato Birolli]], [[Ennio Morlotti]], [[Armando Pizzinato]], Giuseppe Santomaso, Alberto Viani, [[Bruno Cassinari]], [[Renato Guttuso]], Leoncillo Leonardi and [[Carlo Levi]]. Later on, Guttuso proposed to change the name of the movement to ''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''. 

The reasoning for this group of artists and critics to develop the ideas leading to the formation of the ''Fronte'' was to go beyond the positions of the movement Novecento italiano, who were deemed as outdated in light of the most recent artistic developments in Europe. 

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti'' had a number of exhibitions in Italy but it disbanded after an intense internal debate about [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Pizzinato and Guttuso rejected [[abstractionism]] and announced their decision to quit. The movement was officially dissolved on 3 September 1950 in Venice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">The '''Gajski-Kuhn chart''' (or ''Y diagram'') depicts the different perspectives in [[VLSI|VLSI hardware design]].&lt;ref name=grout&gt;{{cite book|last=Grout|first=Ian|title=Digital Systems Design with FPGAs and CPLDs|year=2008|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|isbn=075068397X|pages=724}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mostly, it is used for the development of [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Daniel Gajski]] and Robert Kuhn developed it in 1983. In 1985, Robert Walker and Donald Thomas refined it.

According to this model, the development of hardware is perceived within three '''domains''' that are depicted as three axis and produce a Y. Along these axis, the '''abstraction levels''' that describe the degree of abstraction. The outer shells are generalisations, the inner ones refinements of the same subject.

The issue in hardware development is most often a [[top-down design]] problem. This is perceived by the three domains of behaviour, structure, and the layout that goes top-down to more detailed abstraction levels. The designer can select one of the perspectives and then switch from one view to another. Generally, the design process is not following a specific sequence in this diagram.

* On the '''system level''', basic properties of an electronic system are determined. For the behavioural description, [[block diagram]]s are used by making abstractions of signals and their time response. Blocks used in the structure domain are [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, [[Computer memory|memory chip]], etc.
* The '''algorithmic level''' is defined by the definition of concurrent algorithms (signals, loops, variables, assignments). In the structural domain, blocks like [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s are in use.
* The '''[[register-transfer level]]''' (RTL) is a more detailed abstraction level on which the behaviour between communicating registers and logic units is described. Here, data structures and data flows are defined. In the geometric view, the design step of the [[floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplan]] is located.
* The '''logical level''' is described in the behaviour perspective by [[boolean equation]]s. In the structural view, this is displayed with [[Logical gate|gate]]s and [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]. In the geometric domain, the logical level is described by [[standard cell]]s.
* The behaviour of the '''circuit level''' is described by mathematics using [[differential equation]]s or [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|logical equation]]s. This corresponds to [[transistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s up to [[crystal lattice]]s.

In [[general relativity]], a point mass deflects a light ray with [[impact parameter]] &lt;math&gt;b~&lt;/math&gt; by an angle approximately equal to

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\alpha} = \frac{4GM}{c^2b}&lt;/math&gt;

where G is the [[gravitational constant]], M the mass of the deflecting object  and c the [[speed of light]]. A naive application of [[Newtonian gravity]] can yield exactly half this value, where the light ray is assumed as a massed particle and scattered by the gravitational potential well.  This approximation is good when &lt;math&gt;4GM/c^2b&lt;/math&gt; is small.

In situations where general relativity can be approximated by [[linearized gravity]], the deflection due to a spatially extended mass can be written simply as a vector sum over point masses.  In the [[continuum limit]], this becomes an integral over the density &lt;math&gt;\rho~&lt;/math&gt;, and if the deflection is small we can approximate the gravitational potential along the deflected trajectory by the potential along the undeflected trajectory, as in the [[Born approximation]] in quantum mechanics. The deflection is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{\xi})=\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int d^2\xi^{\prime} \int dz \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z)  \frac{\vec{b}}{|\vec{b}|^2}, ~ \vec{b} \equiv \vec{\xi}  - \vec{\xi^{\prime}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the line-of-sight coordinate, and &lt;math&gt; \vec{b} &lt;/math&gt; is the vector impact parameter of the actual ray path from the infinitesimal mass &lt;math&gt;  d^2\xi^{\prime}  dz\rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime},z) &lt;/math&gt; located at the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\vec{\xi}^{\prime}, z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bartelmann| first = M. |author2=Schneider, P. |date=January 2001 | title=Weak Gravitational Lensing| journal = Physics Reports | volume=340 | issue = 4–5 |pages = 291–472 | bibcode = 2001PhR...340..291B | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00082-X|arxiv = astro-ph/9912508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thin lens approximation ==

In the limit of a "thin lens", where the distances between the source, lens, and observer are much larger than the size of the lens (this is almost always true for astronomical objects), we can define the projected mass density

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(\vec{\xi})=\int \rho(\vec{\xi},z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in the plane of the sky.  The deflection angle is then

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\hat{\alpha}}= 
\frac{4 G}{c^2} \int \frac{(\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime})\Sigma(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|^2}d^2 \xi^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Gravitational-lensing-angles.png|right|frame|Angles involved in a thin gravitational lens system.]]

As shown in the diagram on the right, the difference between the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and the observed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is this deflection angle, reduced by a ratio of distances, described as the lens equation

&lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}=\vec{\theta}-\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\theta} - \frac{D_{ds}}{D_s} \vec{\hat{\alpha}}(\vec{D_d\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{ds}~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the lens to the source &lt;math&gt;D_s~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the source, and &lt;math&gt;D_d~&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the lens.  For extragalactic lenses, these must be [[angular diameter distance]]s.

In strong gravitational lensing, this equation can have multiple solutions, because a single source at &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; can be lensed into multiple images.

=== Convergence and deflection potential ===

It is convenient to define the ''convergence''

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{\Sigma(D_d\vec{\theta})}{\Sigma_{cr}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''critical surface density'' (not to be confused with the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the universe)

&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma_{cr} = \frac{c^2 D_s}{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced deflection angle &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \frac{(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime})\kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also define the ''deflection potential''

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int d^2 \theta^{\prime} \kappa(\vec{\theta}^{\prime}) \ln |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}^{\prime}|
&lt;/math&gt;

such that the scaled deflection angle is just the [[gradient]] of the potential and the convergence is half the [[Laplacian]] of the potential:

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\alpha}(\vec{\theta}) = \vec{\nabla} \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \psi(\vec{\theta})
&lt;/math&gt;

The deflection potential can also be written as a scaled projection of the Newtonian gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; of the lens&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite arxiv | last = Narayan| first = R. | last2 = Bartelmann |first2=M. |date=June 1996 | title=Lectures on Gravitational Lensing |arxiv = astro-ph/9606001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lensing Jacobian ===

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] between the unlensed and lensed coordinate systems is

&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}=\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j}=\delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial \alpha_i}{\partial \theta_j}
= \delta_{ij} - \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Because the matrix of second derivatives must be symmetric, the Jacobian can be decomposed into a diagonal term involving the convergence and a [[matrix trace|trace]]-free term involving the ''shear'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]-\gamma\left[\begin{array}{ c c } \cos 2\phi &amp; \sin 2\phi \\ \sin 2\phi &amp; -\cos 2\phi \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and the x-axis.  The term involving the convergence magnifies the image by increasing its size while conserving surface brightness.  The term involving the shear stretches the image [[tangent]]ially around the lens, as discussed in [[#Weak lensing observables|weak lensing observables]].

The shear defined here is ''not'' equivalent to the [[shear mapping|shear]] traditionally defined in mathematics, though both stretch an image non-uniformly.

[[Image:shear-components.svg|right|thumb|300px|Effect of the components of convergence and shear on a circular source represented by the solid green circle. The complex shear notation is defined [[#Shear and reduced shear|below]].]]

=== Fermat surface ===

There is an alternative way of deriving the lens equation, starting from the photon arrival time (Fermat surface) 	

&lt;math&gt;
t =  \int_{0}^{z_s}   { n dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; dz/c &lt;/math&gt; is the time to travel an infinitesimal line element along the source-observer straight line in vacuum, which is 
then corrected by the factor

&lt;math&gt;
1/\cos(\alpha(z))  \approx 1 + {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2}
&lt;/math&gt;

to get the line element along the bended path &lt;math&gt; dl = {dz \over c \cos \alpha(z) } &lt;/math&gt;  with a varying small pitch angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z), &lt;/math&gt; and the refraction index  
{{math|''n''}} for the "aether", i.e., the gravitational field.  The last can be obtained from the fact that a photon travels on a null geodesic of a weakly perturbed static Minkowski universe

&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = 0  = c^2 dt^2 \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right) -  \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)^{-1} dl^2
&lt;/math&gt;
 
where  the uneven gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi \ll c^2 &lt;/math&gt; drives a changing the speed of light

&lt;math&gt;
c' = {dl/dt} = \left(1 + {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right)  c.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the refraction index
 
&lt;math&gt;
 n \equiv {c \over c'} \approx  \left(1 -  {2 \Phi \over c^2} \right). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The refraction index greater than unity because of the negative gravitational potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;.

Put these together and keep the leading terms we have the time arrival surface

&lt;math&gt; 
t \approx \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c}  +  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {\alpha(z)^2 \over 2} -  \int_0^{z_s} {dz \over c} {2 \Phi \over c^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the straight path travel time, the second term is the extra geometric path, and the third is the gravitational delay. 
Make the triangle approximation that &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) = \theta - \beta &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the observer and the lens, 
and &lt;math&gt; \alpha(z) \approx (\theta - \beta) {D_d \over D_{ds}} &lt;/math&gt; for the path between the lens and the source.  
The geometric delay term becomes

&lt;math&gt;
    {D_d \over c}   { (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} 
+ {D_{ds} \over c}  { \left[ (\vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )  {D_d \over D_{ds}} \right]^2 \over 2}
= {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} }    { ( \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta} )^2 \over 2} .
&lt;/math&gt;
(How? There is no D_s on the left. Angular diameter distances don't add in a simple way, in general.)
So the Fermat surface becomes

&lt;math&gt;
 t = constant + {D_d D_s \over D_{ds} c} \tau, ~ \tau \equiv \left[  { (\vec{\theta}-\vec{\beta})^2 \over 2} -  \psi \right] 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is so-called dimensionless time delay, and the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{2 D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2} \int \Phi(D_d\vec{\theta},z) dz.
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The images lie at the extrema of this surface, so the variation of t with &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;  is zero,

&lt;math&gt;
0 = \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \tau  =  \vec{\theta} - \vec{\beta}  - \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the lens equation.  Take the Poisson's equation for 3D potential 
&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(\vec{\xi})  = - \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|} 
&lt;/math&gt;

and we find the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\vec{\theta})   = - \frac{2 G D_{ds}}{D_d D_s c^2}   \int dz  \int  \frac{d^3\xi^{\prime} \rho(\vec{\xi}^{\prime})}{|\vec{\xi}-\vec{\xi}^{\prime}|}
 =  -  \sum_i \frac{2 G M_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[  \sinh^{-1}  { |z -D_i| \over D_i |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |  }  \right ] |_{D_i}^{D_s}  + |_{D_i}^{0} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we assumed the lens is a collection of point masses &lt;math&gt; M_i &lt;/math&gt; at angular coordinates &lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta}_i &lt;/math&gt; and distances &lt;math&gt; z=D_i .&lt;/math&gt;  
Use &lt;math&gt; \sinh^{-1} 1/x = \ln(1/x + \sqrt{1/x^2+1}) \approx -\ln(x/2) &lt;/math&gt; for very small {{math|''x''}} we find

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   \sum_i  \frac{2 GM_i D_{is} }{D_s D_i c^2}   \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_i \over D_{is} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

One can  compute the ''convergence'' by applying the 2D Laplacian of the 2D lensing potential

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa(\vec{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{\vec{\theta}}^2 \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \frac{4\pi G D_{ds}D_d} {c^2 D_s} \int dz \rho( D_d \vec{\theta},z) 
== {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} } == \sum_i { 4\pi G M_i D_{is} \over c^2 D_i D_s}  \delta(\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

in agreement with earlier definition &lt;math&gt; \kappa(\vec{\theta}) =  {\Sigma \over \Sigma_{cr} }&lt;/math&gt; as the ratio of projected density with the critical density.  
Here we used &lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 1/r = - 4 \pi \delta(r) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} = D_d \nabla. &lt;/math&gt;

We can also confirm the previously defined reduced deflection angle

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =  \nabla_{\vec{\theta}} \psi(\vec{\theta}) =  \sum_i   {  \theta_{Ei}^2  \over |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |} , ~ 
\pi \theta_{Ei}^2 \equiv  {4 \pi GM_i D_{is}  \over c^2 D_s  D_i } 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta_{Ei} &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called Einstein angular radius of a point lens Mi.   For a single point lens at the origin we recover the standard result 
that there will be two images at the two solutions of the essentially quadratic equation

&lt;math&gt; \vec{\theta} -\vec{\beta}   =   {\theta_{E}^2  \over |\vec{\theta} |}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The amplification matrix can be obtained by double derivatives of the dimensionless time delay

&lt;math&gt;
A_{ij} = {\partial \beta_j \over \partial \theta_i} = {\partial \tau \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } = \delta_{ij} -  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j } 
= \left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\kappa -\gamma_1 &amp; \gamma_2 \\ \gamma_2 &amp; 1-\kappa +\gamma_1 \end{array}\right]  &lt;/math&gt;

where we have define the derivatives

&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } +  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } , 
~ \gamma_1 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over 2 \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_1 } -  {\partial \psi \over 2\partial \theta_2 \partial \theta_2 } ,   
~ \gamma_2 \equiv  {\partial \psi \over \partial \theta_1 \partial \theta_2 }    &lt;/math&gt;

which takes the meaning of convergence and shear.   The amplification is the inverse of the Jacobian

&lt;math&gt;   A = 1/det(A_{ij}) = {1 \over (1-\kappa)^2 -\gamma_1^2 -\gamma_2^2}  &lt;/math&gt;

where a positive A means either a maxima or a minima, and a negative A means a saddle point in the arrival surface.

For a single point lens, one can show (albeit a lengthy calculation) that

&lt;math&gt; \kappa =0, ~ \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma_1^2 + \gamma_2^2} = {\theta_E^2 \over |\theta|^2}, ~ \theta_E^2= {4GM D_{ds} \over c^2 D_dD_s}.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the amplification of a point lens is given by

&lt;math&gt;
A = \left( 1 - {\theta_E^4 \over \theta^4} \right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note A diverges for images at the Einstein radius &lt;math&gt; \theta_E. &lt;/math&gt;

In cases there are multiple point lenses plus a smooth background of (dark) particles of surface density &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\rm cr} \kappa_{\rm smooth}, &lt;/math&gt; the time arrival surface is

&lt;math&gt;
\psi(\vec{\theta})   \approx   {1 \over 2} \kappa_{\rm smooth} |\theta|^2 +  \sum_i  \theta_E^2  \left[   \ln\left( { |\vec{\theta}-\vec{\theta}_i |^2 \over 4}  { D_d \over D_{ds} } \right)     \right]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

To compute the amplification, e.g., at the origin (0,0), due to identical point masses distributed at &lt;math&gt;  (\theta_{xi},\theta_{yi} ) &lt;/math&gt; 
we have to add up the total shear, and include a convergence of the smooth background, 
&lt;math&gt;
A = \left[ (1 - \kappa_{\rm smooth})^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (\theta_{xi}^2 - \theta_{yi}^2 ) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }\right) ^2  
                  - \left( \sum_i {  (2 \theta_{xi} \theta_{yi}) \theta_E^2 \over (\theta_{xi}^2 + \theta_{yi}^2)^2 }  \right)^2   \right] ^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

This generally creates a network of critical curves, lines connecting image points of infinite amplification.

== General weak lensing ==

In [[Weak gravitational lensing#Cosmic shear|weak lensing by large-scale structure]], the thin-lens approximation may break down, and low-density extended structures may not be well approximated by multiple thin-lens planes.  In this case, the deflection can be derived by instead assuming that the gravitational potential is slowly varying everywhere (for this reason, this approximation is not valid for strong lensing).
This approach assumes the universe is well described by a Newtonian-perturbed [[FRW metric]], but it makes no other assumptions about the distribution of the lensing mass.

As in the thin-lens case, the effect can be written as a mapping from the unlensed angular position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; to the lensed position &lt;math&gt;\vec{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the transform can be written as an integral over the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi~&lt;/math&gt; along the line of sight
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|date=2003|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-12-219141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \theta_j} = \delta_{ij} + \int_0^{r_\infty} dr 
  g(r) \frac{\partial^2  \Phi(\vec{x}(r))}{\partial x^i
    \partial x^j}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], &lt;math&gt;x^i~&lt;/math&gt; are the transverse distances, and

&lt;math&gt;
g(r) = 2 r \int^{r_\infty}_r dr'
    \left(1-\frac{r^\prime}{r}\right)W(r^\prime)
&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''lensing kernel'', which defines the efficiency of lensing for a distribution of sources &lt;math&gt;W(r)~&lt;/math&gt;.

The Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}~&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into convergence and shear terms just as with the thin-lens case, and in the limit of a lens that is both thin and weak, their physical interpretations are the same.

== Weak lensing observables ==

In [[weak gravitational lensing]], the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|Jacobian]] is mapped out by observing the effect of the shear on the ellipticities of background galaxies.  This effect is purely statistical; the shape of any galaxy will be dominated by its random, unlensed shape, but lensing will produce a spatially coherent distortion of these shapes.

=== Measures of ellipticity ===

In most fields of astronomy, the ellipticity is defined as &lt;math&gt;1-q~&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the axis ratio of the [[ellipse]].  In [[weak gravitational lensing]], two different definitions are commonly used, and both are complex quantities which specify both the axis ratio and the position angle &lt;math&gt;\phi~&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{1-q^2}{1+q^2}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2+b^2}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{1-q}{1+q}e^{2i\phi} = \frac{a-b}{a+b}e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Like the traditional ellipticity, the magnitudes of both of these quantities range from 0 (circular) to 1 (a line segment).  The position angle is encoded in the complex phase, but because of the factor of 2 in the trigonometric arguments, ellipticity is invariant under a rotation of 180 degrees.  This is to be expected; an ellipse is unchanged by a 180° rotation.  Taken as imaginary and real parts, the real part of the complex ellipticity describes the elongation along the coordinate axes, while the imaginary part describes the elongation at 45° from the axes.

The ellipticity is often written as a two-component vector instead of a complex number, though it is not a true [[Coordinate vector|vector]] with regard to transforms:

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \{\left|\chi\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\chi\right|\sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \{\left|\epsilon\right|\cos 2\phi, \left|\epsilon\right| \sin 2\phi\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Real astronomical background sources are not perfect ellipses.  Their ellipticities can be measured by finding a best-fit elliptical model to the data, or by measuring the second moments of the image about some [[centroid]] &lt;math&gt;(\bar{x},\bar{y})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The complex ellipticities are then

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{q_{xx}-q_{yy} + 2 i q_{xy}}{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + 2\sqrt{q_{xx}q_{yy}-q_{xy}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to relate the second moments to traditional ellipse parameters:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = a^2 \cos^2 \theta + b^2 \sin^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = a^2 \sin^2 \theta + b^2 \cos^2 \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = (a^2-b^2)\sin \theta \cos \theta\,
&lt;/math&gt;

and in reverse:

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} + \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
b^2 = \frac{q_{xx}+q_{yy} - \sqrt{(q_{xx}-q_{yy})^2 + 4q_{xy}^2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2q_{xy}}{q_{xx}-q_{yy}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The unweighted second moments above are problematic in the presence of noise, neighboring objects, or extended galaxy profiles, so it is typical to use [[apodization|apodized]] moments instead:

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xx} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{yy} = \frac{\sum (y-\bar{y})^2 w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
q_{xy} = \frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}{\sum w(x-\bar{x},y-\bar{y}) I(x,y)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;w(x,y)~&lt;/math&gt; is a weight function that typically goes to zero or quickly approaches zero at some finite radius.

Image moments cannot generally be used to measure the ellipticity of galaxies without correcting for [[Weak gravitational lensing#Methodology|observational effects]], particularly the [[point spread function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bernstein| first = G. |author2=Jarvis, M. |date=February 2002 | title=Shapes and Shears, Stars and Smears: Optimal Measurements for Weak Lensing| journal = Astronomical Journal | volume=123 | issue = 2 |pages = 583–618 | bibcode = 2002AJ....123..583B | doi = 10.1086/338085|arxiv = astro-ph/0107431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shear and reduced shear ===

Recall that the [[Gravitational Lensing Formalism#Lensing Jacobian|lensing Jacobian]] can be decomposed into shear &lt;math&gt;\gamma~&lt;/math&gt; and convergence &lt;math&gt;\kappa~&lt;/math&gt;.
Acting on a circular background source with radius &lt;math&gt;R~&lt;/math&gt;, lensing generates an ellipse with major and minor axes

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{R}{1-\kappa-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R}{1-\kappa+\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

as long as the shear and convergence do not change appreciably over the size of the source (in that case, the lensed image is not an ellipse).  Galaxies are not intrinsically circular, however, so it is necessary to quantify the effect of lensing on a non-zero ellipticity.

We can define the ''complex shear'' in analogy to the complex ellipticities defined above

&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = \left|\gamma\right| e^{2i\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

as well as the ''reduced shear''

&lt;math&gt;
g \equiv \frac{\gamma}{1-\kappa}
&lt;/math&gt;

The lensing Jacobian can now be written as

&lt;math&gt;
A=\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1 - \kappa - \mathrm{Re}[\gamma] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[\gamma] &amp; 1 -\kappa + \mathrm{Re}[\gamma]\end{array}\right]
=(1-\kappa)\left[\begin{array}{ c c } 1-\mathrm{Re}[g] &amp; -\mathrm{Im}[g] \\ -\mathrm{Im}[g] &amp; 1+ \mathrm{Re}[g]\end{array}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

For a reduced shear &lt;math&gt;g~&lt;/math&gt; and unlensed complex ellipticities &lt;math&gt;\chi_s~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_s~&lt;/math&gt;, the lensed ellipticities are

&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac{\chi_s+2g+g^2\chi_s^*}{1+|g|^2 + 2\mathrm{Re}(g\chi_s^*)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_s+g}{1+g^*\epsilon_s}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the weak lensing limit, &lt;math&gt;\gamma \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, so

&lt;math&gt;
\chi \approx \chi_s+2g \approx \chi_s+2\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon \approx \epsilon_s+g \approx \epsilon_s+\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

If we can assume that the sources are randomly oriented, their complex ellipticities average to zero, so
&lt;math&gt; \langle \chi \rangle = 2\langle \gamma \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon \rangle = \langle \gamma \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the principal equation of weak lensing: the average ellipticity of background galaxies is a direct measure of the shear induced by foreground mass.

=== Magnification ===

While gravitational lensing preserves surface brightness, as dictated by [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], lensing does change the apparent [[solid angle]] of a source. The amount of [[magnification]] is given by the ratio of the image area to the source area. For a circularly [[symmetry|symmetric]] lens, the magnification factor μ is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{\theta}{\beta} \frac{d\theta}{d\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of convergence and shear

&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \frac{1}{\det A} = \frac{1}{[(1-\kappa)^2-\gamma^2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the "inverse magnification matrix".

The reduced shear is invariant with the scaling of the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;A~&lt;/math&gt; by a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to the transformations
&lt;math&gt;
1-\kappa^{\prime} = \lambda(1-\kappa)
&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;
\gamma^{\prime} = \lambda \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; can only be determined up to a transformation &lt;math&gt;\kappa \rightarrow \lambda \kappa+(1-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, which is known as the "mass sheet degeneracy." In principle, this degeneracy can be broken if an independent measurement of the magnification is available because the magnification is not invariant under the aforementioned degeneracy transformation. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;\mu~&lt;/math&gt; scales with &lt;math&gt;\lambda~&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\mu \propto \lambda^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|'''Higher School Certificate''']]''' (HSC) Economics''' course is a 2-unit elective course undertaken by students in [[New South Wales]] across their final 2 years of schooling. The course includes a preliminary program for study across 3 terms of Year 11, and an HSC course for study over 4 terms of [[Year 12]]. In 2012, 5,262 students sat the HSC Economics external examination, with 12.5% receiving the top performance indicator of a Band 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/ebos/static/BDHSC_2012_12_15110.html&lt;/ref&gt; The course aims to take a "problems and issues approach" to the teaching and learning of economics, with a particular emphasis on the economic problems and issues experienced by individuals and society.

The key issues of the HSC Economics syllabus are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/economics-st6-syl-from2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic growth 
* Quality of life
* Unemployment
* Inflation
* External stability
* Distribution of income
* Environmental sustainability
== Preliminary course ==

The focus of the Preliminary course is on the practical problems and issues that affect individuals, firms and governments, whilst also introducing core microeconomic and macroeconomic principles to students. The content of the Preliminary Course includes the topics:
* Introduction to Economics
* Consumers and Business
* Markets
* [[Labour markets]]
* [[Financial Markets]]
* Government and the Economy

== HSC course ==

In the HSC course, the problems and issues are studied in relation to the national, regional and global economies, and are in a much higher level of depth. The HSC course consists of four topics (of greater length than in the Preliminary Course). Also included in Topic 1 is a case study of an economy other than Australia, and the impact of [[globalisation]] on that economy, along with economic policies used. The most popular topics for this case study are China, Indonesia, and Brazil.

The four topics studied in the HSC course are:
*[[World Economy|The Global Economy]]
*[[Economy of Australia|Australia's]] Role in the Global Economy
*Economic Issues
*Economic Policies and Management

The HSC examination allows 3 hours and encompasses the following items:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/economics-assessment-reporting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sect I (20 marks): Twenty objective response ([[multiple choice]]) questions mostly examining definitions, basic economic calculations, and the application of basic economic analysis and reasoning skills.

Sect 2 (40 marks): Four short answer questions (in parts, with questions ranging from 1 to 6 marks) examining all parts of the content, sometimes encompassing stimulus material.

Sect 3 (20 marks): Students choose from one of two extended response questions, based on stimulus material provided. Expected length of 800–1100 words.

Sect 4 (20 marks): Students choose from one of two extended response questions. Expected length of 800–1100 words

== Textbooks ==

Three textbooks are updated and published annually, each covering the current 2009 Economics syllabus for the HSC programme:
* Year 12 Economics, Tim Riley (Tim Riley Publications)
* Australia in the Global Economy, Tim Dixon and John Mahony (Pearson Australia)
* Updated Economics (tri-annual publication), John Bulmer (David Barlow Publishing)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7874">'''Hawaiian studies''' is an academic discipline dedicated to the study of [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]]. It evolved in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional disciplines such as [[anthropology]], history, [[English language]], [[ethnology]], [[Asian Studies]], and [[orientalism]] were imbued with an inherently [[eurocentric]] perspective. [[Ethnic Studies]] has mostly been a study of minority settler cultures although Hawaiian Studies shares with [[Ethnic Studies]] attempts to remedy problems with other academic disciplines by trying to study Hawaiian culture and people on their own terms, in their own language, acknowledging their own values.

==History==
In [[Hawaii]], the discipline of Hawaiian Studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and early 1970s, which saw growing self-awareness and radicalization of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Decolonization]] struggles around the world.{{citation needed |date= April 2014}} Hawaiian Studies courses and then departments were established on campus around Hawaii. Thinkers like [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] and [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith]] influence Hawaiian Studies.{{citation needed |date= December 2010}}

While early Hawaiian Studies scholarship focused on the previously repressed histories and identities of Hawaiian groups within the context of the U.S., over time the field of study has expanded to encompass ontological/epistemological philosophy, transnationalism, comparative race studies and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. {{citation needed |date= April 2014}} While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. {{citation needed |date= April 2014}}

[[Haunani-Kay Trask|Professor Haunani Kay Trask]] became the first tenured professor in Hawaiian Studies at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1986. She assisted [[Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa]], Jonathan Osorio and [[Terry Kainalu Young|Kainalu Young]] in obtaining their doctorates on Hawaiian Studies topics and in becoming tenured professors in Hawaiian Studies. After years of effort, [[Gladys Brandt|Gladys Kamakakuokalani Brandt]] and Trask were able to get funding to build a permanent home for the Center for Hawaiian Studies. It is now called the Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies |publisher= [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |url= http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/kamakakuokalani.htm |accessdate= December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center added two master's degree programs in Hawaiian Studies in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Two master's degrees in Hawaiian Studies approved |date= May 10, 2005 |author= Kimberly Gee |work= Ka Leo (The Voice) |url= http://www.kaleo.org/2.13219/two-master-s-degrees-in-hawaiian-studies-approved-1.1810427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The center is now part of the Hawai{{okina}}inuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hawaiʻinuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge |publisher= [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |url= http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/ |accessdate= December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawaiian Studies program at the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] is centered more closely around the instruction of the [[Hawaiian language]]. In 1997, the Ka Haka ‘Ula O Ke‘elikōlani College of Hawaiian Language was established to complement its Hale Kuamo{{okina}}o. [http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/academics/hawn/]

The Hawaiian Studies program at the [[BYUH|Brigham Young University Hawaii]] structures its instruction and research around perceived connections between Hawaiian culture and the [[Book of Mormon]] and other doctrinal beliefs of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. [http://w2.byuh.edu/academics/hwnstudies/]

==Criticism==
Hawaiian Studies has faced some opposition and rejection from critics. They have no objection about Hawaiian culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of Ethnic Studies which they see as characterised by excessive left wing political ideology or Hawaiian claims to justice which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. Hawaiian Studies has been accused of promoting "racial separatism", "racial supremacy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conklin|first1=Kenneth|title=University of Hawai'i and Hawaiian Sovereignty -- A Case Study in Political Correctness Run Amok|url=http://www.angelfire.com/hi2/hawaiiansovereignty/uhacafreeintro.html|website=Hawaiian Sovereignty|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;", linguistic isolation" and "racial preference". 

Professor Haunani-Kay Trask was criticized for contributing to a culture of systemic racism and violence against white people in Hawaii in an intelligence report published by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC). The Law Center wrote that Professor Trask's book ''From A Native Daughter'' justifies hatred against white people by Native Hawaiians. The SPLC also finds violence against white people as being justified in Trask's poem, ''Racist White Woman'', which reads in part: "I could kick/Your face, puncture/Both eyes./You deserve this kind/Of violence./No more vicious/Tongues, obscene/Lies./Just a knife/Slitting your tight/Little heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Larry|title=Hawaii Suffering From Racial Prejudice; Hawaii Has a Racism Problem|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2009/fall/prejudice-in-paradise|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a guest lecture at Stanford University, Trask embraced the label of 'racist', saying, "In Hawaii, I am probably the most famous racist." She added that it impossible for a Hawaiian to not be considered racist in Hawaii unless "you dance in a hotel". She also stated that, if she could have her way, non-Hawaiians would have no property rights in a sovereign Hawaii. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Kathleen|title=Hawaiian nationalist discusses rights Constitution doesn't recognize|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/98/980401hawaii.html|website=Stanford News service|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Hawaiian Studies feel that opposition comes from a reactionary movement from the right. They point out the rise of the conservative movement in the United States during the 1990s which saw the discipline come increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is characterised as an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this actually is a slant by the proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. 

Hawaiian Studies has suffered most criticism by attorney William Burgess and retired high school mathematics teacher [[Kenneth Conklin]]. Their criticism is political and aimed at Hawaiian claims to justice and has never really attacked the actual scholarship of Hawaiian Studies scholars. [http://www.kenconklin.com/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5691">Hertwig's rule or 'long axis rule' states that a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] divides along its long axis. It was introduced by german zoologist [[Oscar Hertwig]] in 1884. The rule emphasizes the cell shape to be a default mechanism of [[spindle apparatus]] orientation. Hertwig's rule predicts [[cell division orientation]], that is important for tissue architecture, cell fate and [[morphogenesis]].

==Discovery==

In Hertwig's experiments the orientation of divisions of the frog egg was studied. Frog egg has a round shape and the first division occur in the random orientation. Hertwig compressed the egg between two parallel plates. The compression forced egg to change its shape from round to elongated. Hertwig noticed that elongated egg divides not randomly, but orthogonal to its long axis. The new daughter cells were formed along the longest axis of the cell. That observation got name of  'Hertwig's rule' or 'long axis rule'.&lt;ref name = "Hertwig1884"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hertwig O | title=Das Problem der Befruchtung und der Isotropie des Eies. Eine Theorie der Vererbung. | journal=Jenaische Zeitschrift fur Naturwissenschaft | volume=18 | pages=274 | year=1884  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confirmation and Mechanism==
[[File:TCJ orients spindle apparatus during cell division.png|thumb|Cartoon of the dividing epithelium cell surrounded by epithelium tissue. Spindle apparatus rotates inside the cell. The rotation is a result of astral microtubules pulling towards tri-cellular-junctions (TCJ), signaling centers localized at the regions where three cells meet.]]
Recent studies in animal and plant systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo,&lt;ref name = "Grey2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gray D, Plusa B, Piotrowska K, Ha J, Glower D, Zernicka-Goetz M | title=First cleavage of the mouse embryo responds to change in egg shape at fertilization | journal=Current Biology | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=397–405 | year=2004 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.031| pmid=15028215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drosophila epithelium,&lt;ref name = "Bosveld2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bosveld F, Markova O, Guirao B, Martin C, Wang Z, Pierre A, Balakireva M, Gaugue I, Ainslie A, Christophorou N, Lubensky DK, Minc N, Bellaïche Y | title=Epithelial tricellular junctions act as interphase cell shape sensors to orient mitosis | journal=Nature | volume=530 | issue=7591 | pages=496–8 | year=2016 | pmid=26886796 | pmc=5450930 | doi=10.1038/nature16970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers &lt;ref name = "Wyatt2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wyatt T, Harris A, Lam M, Cheng Q, Bellis J, Dimitracopoulos A, Kabla A, Charras G, Baumm B| title=Emergence of homeostatic epithelial packing and stress dissipation through divisions oriented along the long cell axis | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=112 | issue=18 | pages=5726–5731  | year=2015 |  doi= 10.1073/pnas.1420585112 | pmid=25908119 | pmc=4426437}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).
The mechanism of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on the orientation of the cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates [[Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ)]] participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell.&lt;ref name="Bosveld2016"/&gt; However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.

==Mechanobiology==
It has been shown that mechanical force can cause cells to divide against their long axis and instead with the direction of mechanical stretch in MDCK monolayers. &lt;ref name = "Hart2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Kevin C.|last2=Tan|first2=Jiongyi|last3=Siemers|first3=Kathleen A.|last4=Sim|first4=Joo Yong|last5=Pruitt|first5=Beth L.|last6=Nelson|first6=W. James|last7=Gloerich|first7=Martijn|title=E-cadherin and LGN align epithelial cell divisions with tissue tension independently of cell shape|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=18 July 2017|volume=114|issue=29|pages=E5845–E5853|doi=10.1073/pnas.1701703114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

Cell divisions along 'long axis' are proposed to be implicated in the morphogenesis, tissue response to stresses and tissue architecture.
Division along the long cell axis reduces global tissue stress more rapidly than random divisions or divisions along the axis of mechanical stress. Long-axis division contributes to the formation of isotropic cell shapes within the monolayer.

The "primary" core (grey) has grooves, and the windings are laid into them on top of each other. An aluminium plate above (not shown) serves as "secondary" and will move relative to the primary if a 3 phase AC is applied.]]
[[File:Linear induction motor.gif|thumb|A transverse flux linear induction motor (here the primary is at top of picture) and has two sets of opposite poles side by side. (Picture from US Patent 3824414 by [[Eric Laithwaite]])]]

A '''linear induction motor''' ('''LIM''') is an [[alternating current]] (AC), asynchronous [[linear motor]] that works by the same general principles as other [[induction motor]]s but is typically designed to directly produce motion in a straight line. Characteristically, linear induction motors have a finite primary or secondary length, which generates end-effects, whereas a conventional induction motor is arranged in an endless loop.&lt;ref name=Liasi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghaseminejad Liasi|first1=Sahand|title=What are linear motors?|date=15 May 2015|page=1-50|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.16250.18887|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322040360_What_are_linear_motors|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their name, not all linear induction motors produce linear motion; some linear induction motors are employed for generating rotations of large diameters where the use of a continuous primary would be very expensive.

As with rotary motors, linear motors frequently run on a three-phase power supply and can support very high speeds. However, there are end-effects that reduce the motor's force, and it is often not possible to fit a gearbox to trade off force and speed. Linear induction motors are thus frequently less energy efficient than normal rotary motors for any given required force output.

LIMs, unlike their rotary counterparts, can give a levitation effect. They are therefore often used where contactless force is required, where low maintenance is desirable, or where the duty cycle is low.  Their practical uses include [[magnetic levitation]], linear propulsion, and linear actuators. They have also been used for pumping liquid metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=NfAng_7A27&amp;dq=einstein+Linear+induction+motor&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=einstein+Linear+induction+motor&amp;f=false|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|first=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science|last=Inc|date=1 September 1973|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s to the work of [[Charles Wheatstone]] at [[King's College London|King's College]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |title=Charles Wheatstone - College History - King's College London |publisher=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021162729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |archivedate=October 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Wheatstone's model was too inefficient to be practical. A feasible linear induction motor is described in US patent 782312 (1905; inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main), and is for driving trains or lifts. German engineer [[Hermann Kemper]] built a working model in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000224/http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] of [[Imperial College]] in [[London]] developed the first full-size working model.

[[File:Magnetic river 3.png|thumb|upright=1.2|FEMM simulation of a Cross-section of Magnetic River, coloured by electric current density]]
In a single-sided version, the magnetic field can create repulsion forces that push the conductor away from the stator, levitating it and carrying it along the direction of the moving magnetic field. Laithwaite called the later versions a [[magnetic river]]. These versions of the linear induction motor use a principle called ''transverse flux'' where two opposite poles are placed side by side. This permits very long poles to be used, and thus permits high speed and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Patent number 3585423, 1971 Laithwaite et al&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
A linear electric motor's primary typically consists of a flat magnetic core (generally laminated) with transverse slots that are often straight cut&lt;ref name="inexpensive"&gt;[http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/uploads/docs/380117.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with coils laid into the slots, with each phase giving an alternating polarity so that the different phases physically overlap.

The secondary is frequently a sheet of aluminium, often with an iron backing plate. Some LIMs are double sided with one primary on each side of the secondary, and, in this case, no iron backing is needed.

Two types of linear motor exist: a ''short primary'', where the coils are truncated shorter than the secondary, and a ''short secondary'', where the conductive plate is smaller. Short secondary LIMs are often wound as parallel connections between coils of the same phase, whereas short primaries are usually wound in series.&lt;ref name=personalView/&gt;

The primaries of transverse flux LIMs have a series of twin poles lying transversely side-by-side with opposite winding directions. These poles are typically made either with a suitably cut laminated backing plate or a series of transverse U-cores.

==Principles==
[[File:Linear motor field.gif|thumb|The magnetic field of a linear motor sweeping to the left, past an aluminium block. Coloured by induced electric current.]]
In this electric motor design, the force is produced by a linearly moving [[magnetic field]] acting on conductors in the field. Any conductor, be it a loop, a coil, or simply a piece of plate metal, that is placed in this field will have [[eddy current]]s [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] in it thus creating an opposing magnetic field in accordance with [[Lenz's law]]. The two opposing fields will repel each other, creating motion as the magnetic field sweeps through the metal.

where {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is supply frequency in Hz, {{math|''p''}} is the number of poles, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the synchronous speed of the magnetic field in revolutions per second.

The travelling field pattern has a velocity of:
:&lt;math&gt;v_s=2 t f_s&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=sunilsaharan/&gt;
where {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is velocity of the linear travelling field in m/s, and {{math|''t''}} is the pole pitch.

For a slip of {{math|''s''}}, the speed of the secondary in a linear motor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;v_r=(1-s)v_s&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=sunilsaharan/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Forces==

===Thrust===
[[File:Couple glissement MAs.svg|thumb|right|Thrust generated as a function of slip]]
The drive generated by linear induction motors is somewhat similar to conventional induction motors; the drive forces show a roughly similar characteristic shape relative to slip, albeit modulated by end effects.&lt;ref name=force&gt;Force Analysis of Linear Induction Motor for Magnetic Levitation System 14th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, EPE-PEMC 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Equations exist for calculating the thrust of a motor.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Modern Transportation June 2012, Volume 20, Issue 2, pp 76–81 A novel method to calculate the thrust of linear induction motor based on instantaneous current value&lt;/ref&gt;

===End effect===
Unlike a circular induction motor, a linear induction motor shows 'end effects'. These end effects include losses in performance and efficiency that are believed to be caused by magnetic energy being carried away and lost at the end of the primary by the relative movement of the primary and secondary.

With a short secondary, the behaviour is almost identical to a rotary machine, provided it is at least two poles long but with a short primary reduction in thrust that occurs at low slip (below about 0.3) until it is eight poles or longer.&lt;ref name=personalView&gt;linear Electric Machines- A Personal View ERIC R. LAITHWAITE, FELLOW, IEEE, PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 63, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because of end effects, linear motors cannot 'run light' -- normal induction motors are able to run the motor with a near synchronous field under low load conditions. In contrast, end effects create much more significant losses with linear motors.&lt;ref name=personalView/&gt;

===Levitation===
[[File:Linear motor torque curve.png|thumb|Levitation and thrust force curves of a linear motor]]
In addition, unlike a rotary motor, an [[electrodynamic levitation]] force is shown, this is zero at zero slip, and gives a roughly constant amount of force/gap as slip increases in either direction. This occurs in single sided motors, and levitation will not usually occur when an iron backing plate is used on the secondary, since this causes an attraction that overwhelms the lifting force.&lt;ref name=force/&gt;
{{clear}}

==Performance==
Linear induction motors are often less efficient than conventional rotary induction motors; the end effects and the relatively large air gap that is often present will typically reduce the forces produced for the same electrical power.&lt;ref name=Liasi/&gt; Similarly, the efficiency during generator operation (electric braking/recuperating) with a linear induction motor was reported as relatively low due to end effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flankl|first1=Michael|last2=Tuysuz|first2=Arda|last3=de Oliveira Baumann|first3=Lukas|last4=Kolar|first4=Johann W.|title=Energy Harvesting with Single-Sided Linear Induction Machines featuring Secondary Conductive Coating|url=https://www.pes-publications.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethpublications/10_Energy-Harvesting-with-Single-Sided-Linear-Induction-Machins-featuring-Secondary-Conductive-Coating_Early-Acces_Flankl.pdf|publisher=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics|accessdate=4 April 2018|ref=SLIM_Generation|archiveurl=https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2821637|archivedate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger air gap also increases the inductance of the motor which can require larger and more expensive capacitors.

However, linear induction motors can avoid the need for gearboxes and similar drivetrains, and these have their own losses; and working knowledge of the importance of the [[goodness factor]] can minimise the effects of the larger air gap. In any case power use is not always the most important consideration. For example, in many cases linear induction motors have far fewer moving parts, and have very low maintenance. Also, using linear induction motors instead of rotating motors with rotary-to-linear transmissions in [[motion control]] systems, enables higher bandwidth and accuracy of the [[control system]], because rotary-to-linear transmissions introduce backlash, static friction and/or mechanical compliance in the control system.

==Uses==
[[File:LIMTV testing at DoT Pueblo test facility.tiff|thumb|right|LIMTV Linear Induction Motor Test Vehicle in 1973]]
Because of these properties, linear motors are often used in [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] propulsion, as in the Japanese [[Linimo]] [[magnetic levitation train]] line near [[Nagoya]].

[[File:Birmingham International Maglev.jpg|thumb|The Birmingham International Maglev shuttle]]
The world's first commercial automated maglev system was a [[AirRail Link#Maglev|low-speed maglev shuttle]] that ran from the airport terminal of [[Birmingham International Airport (United Kingdom)|Birmingham International Airport]] to the nearby [[Birmingham International railway station]] between 1984–1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/488394.stm |title=The magnetic attraction of trains |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the track was {{convert|600|m|ft}}, and trains "flew" at an altitude of {{convert|15|mm|in}}, levitated by electromagnets, and propelled with linear induction motors.&lt;ref&gt;Maglev, A film for The People Mover Group&lt;/ref&gt; It was in operation for nearly eleven years, but [[obsolescence]] problems with the electronic systems made it unreliable in its later years. One of the original cars is now on display at [[Railworld]] in Peterborough, together with the [[Research Test Vehicle 31|RTV31]] hover train vehicle.

However, linear motors have been used independently of magnetic levitation, such as [[Tokyo]]'s [[Toei Ōedo Line]]. [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]'s [[Bombardier Innovia Metro|Innovia Metro]] is an example of an automated system that utilizes LIM propulsion; the longest [[rapid transit]] system employing such technology is [[Vancouver]]'s [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], with approximately {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} of track compatible with Innovia Metro trains.&lt;ref name="UrbanRail"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwandl|first1=Robert|title=UrbanRail.Net &gt; North America &gt; Canada &gt; British Columbia &gt; Vancouver Skytrain|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/am/vanc/vancouver.htm|website=UrbanRail.Net|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linear induction motor technology is also used in some [[launched roller coaster]]s. At present it is still impractical on street running [[tram]]s, although this, in theory, could be done by burying it in a slotted conduit.

[[Image:JFK AirTrain.agr.jpg|thumb|[[AirTrain JFK]] trains propel themselves using an aluminium induction strip placed between the rails.]]
Outside of public transportation, vertical linear motors have been proposed as lifting mechanisms in deep [[mining|mine]]s, and the use of linear motors is growing in [[motion control]] applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of [[low floor]] [[tram]]s such as the [[Citadis]] and the [[Eurotram]].

Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct ''X''-''Y'' motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated [[Technical drawing|drafting]], and cable forming. Also, linear induction motors with a cylindrical secondary have been used to provide simultaneous linear and rotating motion for mounting electronic devices on printed circuit boards.&lt;ref&gt;Mechatronic design of a z-φ induction actuator, P. de Wit, J. van Dijk, T. Blomer, and P. Rutgers, proc. of IEE EMD '97 Conference. Cambridge 1997. pp. 279-283, 1-3 Sept. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motors) or LSM (linear synchronous motors). Linear DC motors are not used as it includes more cost and linear [[Switched reluctance motor|SRM]] suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.

[[File:EMALS.JPG|thumb|A diagram of EMALS' induction motor]]
Linear induction motors have also been used for launching aircraft, the Westinghouse Electropult&lt;ref name=personalView/&gt; system in 1945 was an early example and the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] (EMALS) was due to be delivered in 2010.

Linear induction motors are also used in looms, magnetic levitation enable bobbins to float between the fibers without direct contact.

The first ropeless [[elevator]] invented by [[ThyssenKrupp]] uses [[stairs]], man drive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miley|first1=Jessica|title=The World's First Ropeless Multi-Directional Elevator Will Be Installed in Berlin|url=https://interestingengineering.com/worlds-first-ropeless-multi-directional-elevator-installed-in-berlin|website=Interesting Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global sustainability statistics''' are benchmarks for measuring the status of sustainability parameters. The following agencies provide baseline data for sustainability governance. They are just one form of data used for [[sustainability accounting]] and are valuable for assessing trends and measuring progress. 

'''This list provides sources of statistics at the ''global'' level of governance only.'''

Roof shapes differ greatly from region to region. The main factors which influence the shape of [[roof]]s are the climate and the materials available for roof structure and the outer covering. Roof terminology is also not rigidly defined. Usages vary slightly from region to region, or from one builder or architect to another.

Roof shapes vary from almost flat to steeply pitched. They can be arched or domed; a single flat sheet or a complex arrangement of slopes, gables and hips; or truncated (terraced, cut)&lt;ref&gt;Long, George. "Roof". ''The Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge''. London: Charles Knight, 18331843. 143. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to minimize the overall height.

==Roof shapes==
* [[Flat roof|Flat]]: These are found in traditional buildings in regions with a low precipitation. Modern materials which are highly impermeable to water make possible the very large low-pitch roofs found on large commercial buildings. Although called flat they are generally gently pitched.
** [[Roof garden|Roof terrace (including roof garden)]]: the same with protections from falling such as a balustrade, parapet walls or surrounding raised plant beds used as a living or public dining space.
* Mono-pitched roofs (''Pitched'' here means a roof [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] rather than a slope and implies it is not a flat roof)
** [[Mono-pitched roof]] (shed, skillion, lean-to roof&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Henry J., and Peter R. Smith. "Shed roof" ''Dictionary of architectural and building technology''. London: Elsevier Applied Science Publishers ;, 1986. 272. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof with one slope, historically attached to a taller wall.
** [[Saw-tooth roof|Saw-tooth]]: A roof comprising a mono-pitched roof or for larger buildings, series of, mono-pitched roofs with vertical surfaces glazed and pitched upward in general terms away from the [[equator]], though other directions suit if direct sunlight is desired and where rooftop access may otherwise be impracticable. The roof tops are opaque, shielding traditionally workers and machinery from direct [[sunlight]]. This sort of roof commonly admits natural light into a [[factory]], and is also known as [[North light (architecture)|"Northlight"]] in the northern hemisphere implying a single such plane.&lt;ref&gt;"The Machine Shop and the Works. Modern Principles of Design", ''The Times: Engineering Supplement'', London, November 13, 1912, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pent roof (pentice, skirt roof if carried around the house&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. "Pent roof". ''Harris dictionary of architecture &amp; construction''. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof appended, thus the name, to the wall of a building and by implication having further roofs or terraces above. (See gallery below)
* Multi-pitched roofs:
** [[Gable]] (ridged, dual-pitched, peaked, saddle, pack-saddle, saddleback,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Honour, &amp; Pevsner, ''A Dictionary of Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt; span roof&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "Span Roof". ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 325. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A simple roof design shaped like an inverted V.
*** Cross gabled: The result of joining two or more gabled roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
***See also [[roof pitch]], [[Crow-stepped gable|crow-stepped, corbie stepped, stepped gable]]: A gable roof with its end parapet walls below extended slightly upwards and shaped to resemble steps.
** [[A-frame house|A-frame]]
** Half-hipped (clipped gable): A combination of a gable and a hip roof (pitched roof without changes to the walls) with the hipped part at the top and the gable section lower down.
** [[Gablet roof|Dutch gable, gablet]]: A hybrid of hipped and gable with the gable (wall) at the top and hipped lower down; i.e. the opposite arrangement to the ''half-hipped'' roof. Overhanging [[eaves]] forming shelter around the building are a consequence where the gable wall is in line with the other walls of the buildings that is unless the upper gable or gables is or are recessed.
** [[Saltbox]], catslide: A gable roof with one side longer than the other, and thus closer to the ground unless the pitch on one side is altered.
** Outshot or catslide: A pitched extension of a main roof similar to a lean-to but an extension of the upper roof.
** Bonnet roof: A reversed gambrel or Mansard roof with the lower portion at a lower pitch than the upper portion.
** Monitor roof: A roof with a [[Monitor (architecture)|monitor]]; 'a raised structure running part or all of the way along the ridge of a double-pitched roof, with its own roof running parallel with the main roof.'
** [[Butterfly roof]] (V-roof,&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "V Roof" ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 362. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; London roof&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, John. ''Loft Conversions''. 2nd ed. New York: Wiley, 2012.

** Half-hipped: A hybrid of a gable and a hipped roof. (See above.)
** Dutch gable, gablet: The reverse hybrid of a hipped and a gable roof. (See above.)
** Cross hipped: The result of joining two or more ''hip'' roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
** Satari: A Swedish variant on the ''monitor roof''; a double hip roof with a short vertical wall usually with small windows, popular from the 17th century on formal buildings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (''Säteritak'' in Swedish.)
** [[Mansard roof|Mansard]] (French roof): A roof with the pitch divided into a shallow slope above a steeper slope. The steep slope may be curved. An element of the Second Empire architectural style (Mansard style) in the U.S.
** [[Gambrel|Gambrel, curb, kerb]]: A roof similar to a mansard but sloped in one direction rather than both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13936">The '''MEMO model''' (version 6.2) is a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian]] non-hydrostatic prognostic [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] model for wind-flow simulation. It was developed by the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in collaboration with the [[Universität Karlsruhe]]. The MEMO Model together with the photochemical [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|dispersion model]] MARS are the two core models of the [[Europe]]an zooming model (EZM). This model belongs to the family of models designed for describing atmospheric transport phenomena in the local-to-regional scale, frequently referred to as mesoscale [[air pollution]] models.

==History==
Initially, EZM was developed for modelling the transport and chemical transformation of pollutants in selected European regions in the frame of the EUROTRAC sub-project EUMAC and therefore it was formerly called the EUMAC Zooming Model (EUROTRAC, 1992). EZM has evolved to be one of the most frequently applied mesoscale air pollution model systems in Europe. It has already been successfully applied for various European airsheds including the [[Upper Rhine]] valley and the areas of [[Basel]], [[Graz]], [[Barcelona]], [[Lisbon]], [[Madrid]], [[Milano]], [[London]], [[Cologne]], [[Lyon]], [[The Hague]], [[Athens]] ([[Nicolas Moussiopoulos|Moussiopoulos]], 1994; Moussiopoulos, 1995) and [[Thessaloniki]]. More details are to be found elsewhere (Moussiopoulos 1989), (Flassak 1990), (Moussiopoulos et al. 1993).

== Model equations ==
The prognostic mesoscale model MEMO describes the dynamics of the [[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer]]. In the present model version, air is assumed to be unsaturated. The model solves the [[continuity equation]], the [[momentum]] equations and several [[transport equation]]s for scalars (including the thermal energy equation and, as options, transport equations for water vapour, the turbulent kinetic energy and [[pollutant]]  concentrations).

== Transformation to terrain-following coordinates ==
The lower boundary of the model domain coincides with the ground. Because of the inhomogeneity of the terrain, it is not possible to impose boundary conditions at that boundary with respect to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. Therefore, a transformation of the vertical coordinate to a terrain-following one is performed. Hence, the originally irregularly bounded physical domain is mapped onto one consisting of unit cubes.

== Numerical solution of the equation system ==
The discretized equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid, i.e. the scalar quantities &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are defined at the cell centre while the velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are defined at the centre of the appropriate interfaces. 

Temporal discretization of the prognostic equations is based on the explicit second order [[Linear multistep method#Adams.E2.80.93Bashforth methods|Adams-Bashforth scheme]]. There are two deviations from the Adams-Bashforth scheme: The first refers to the implicit treatment of the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation &lt;math&gt;p_{{nh}}&lt;/math&gt;. To ensure non-divergence of the flow field, an elliptic equation is solved. The elliptic equation is derived from the continuity equation wherein velocity components are expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;p_{{nh}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the elliptic equation is derived from the discrete form of the continuity equation and the discrete form of the pressure gradient, conservativity is guaranteed (Flassak and Moussiopoulos, 1988). The discrete pressure equation is solved numerically with a fast elliptic solver in conjunction with a generalized conjugate gradient method. The fast elliptic solver is based on fast [[Fourier analysis]] in both horizontal directions and [[Gaussian elimination]] in the vertical direction (Moussiopoulos and Flassak, 1989).

The second deviation from the explicit treatment is related to the turbulent diffusion in vertical direction. In case of an explicit treatment of this term, the stability requirement may necessitate an unacceptable abridgement of the time increment. To avoid this, vertical turbulent diffusion is treated using the second order [[Crank–Nicolson method]].

On principle, advective terms can be computed using any suitable advection scheme. In the present version of MEMO, a 3D second-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) scheme is implemented which is based on the 1D scheme proposed by Harten (1986). It achieves a fair (but not any) reduction of numerical diffusion, the solution being independent of the magnitude of the scalar (preserving transportivity).

== Parameterizations ==
Turbulence and radiative transfer are the most important physical processes that have to be parameterized in a prognostic mesoscale model. In the MEMO model, radiative transfer is calculated with an efficient scheme based on the emissivity method for longwave radiation and an implicit multilayer method for shortwave radiation (Moussiopoulos 1987).

The diffusion terms may be represented as the divergence of the corresponding fluxes. For turbulence parameterizations, K-theory is applied. In case of MEMO turbulence can be treated either with a zero-, one- or two-equation turbulence model. For most applications a one-equation model is used, where a conservation equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is solved.

== Initial and boundary conditions ==
In MEMO, initialization is performed with suitable diagnostic methods: a mass-consistent initial wind field is formulated using an objective analysis model and scalar fields are initialized using appropriate interpolating techniques (Kunz, R., 1991). Data needed to apply the diagnostic methods may be derived either from observations or from larger scale simulations.

Suitable boundary conditions have to be imposed for the wind velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, the potential temperature &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; at all boundaries. At open boundaries, wave reflection and deformation may be minimized by the use of so-called ''radiation conditions'' (Orlanski 1976). 

According to the experience gained so far with the model MEMO, neglecting large scale environmental information might result in instabilities in case of simulations over longer time periods.

For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous [[Neumann boundary condition]]s are used at lateral boundaries. With these conditions, the wind velocity component perpendicular to the boundary remains unaffected by the  pressure change.

At the upper boundary, Neumann boundary conditions are imposed for the horizontal velocity components and the potential temperature. To ensure non-reflectivity, a radiative condition is used for the hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation 
&lt;math&gt;p_h&lt;/math&gt; at that boundary. Hence, vertically propagating internal gravity waves are allowed to leave the computational domain (Klemp and Durran 1983). For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous staggered [[Dirichlet conditions]] are imposed. Being justified by the fact that nonhydrostatic effects are negligible at large heights, this condition is necessary, if singularity of the elliptic pressure equation is to be avoided in view of the Neumann boundary conditions at all other boundaries.

The lower boundary coincides with the ground (or, more precisely, a height above ground corresponding to its aerodynamic roughness). For the non-hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, inhomogeneous Neumann conditions are imposed at that boundary. All other conditions at the lower boundary follow from the assumption that the [[Monin–Obukhov length|–Obukhov]] similarity theory is valid.

The one way interactive nesting facility is possible within MEMO. Thus, successive simulations on grids of increasing resolution are possible. During these simulations, the results of the application to a coarse grid are used as boundary conditions for the application to the finer grid (Kunz and Moussiopoulos, 1995).

== Grid definition ==
The governing equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid. Scalar quantities as the temperature, pressure, density and also the cell volume are defined at the centre of a grid cell and the velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; at the centre of the appropriate interface. Turbulent fluxes are defined at different locations: Shear fluxes are defined at the centre of the appropriate edges of a grid cell and normal stress fluxes at scalar points. With this definition, the outgoing fluxes of momentum, mass, heat and also turbulent fluxes of a grid cell are identical to incoming flux of the adjacent grid cell. So the numerical method is conservative.

== Topography and surface type ==
For calculations with MEMO, a file must be provided which contains orography height and surface type for each grid location The following surface types are distinguished and must be stored as percentage:

* water (type: 1)
* arid land (type: 2)
* few vegetation (type: 3)
* farmland (type: 4)
* forest (type: 5)
* suburban area (type: 6)
* urban area (type: 7)

Only surface types 1–6 have to be stored. Type 7 is the difference between 100% and the sum of types 1–6. If the percentage of a surface type is 100%, then write the number 10 and for all other surface types the number 99.

The [[orography]] height is the mean height for each grid location above sea level in meter. 

== Meteorological data ==
The prognostic model MEMO is a set of partial differential equations in three spatial directions and in time. To solve these equations,  information about the initial state in the whole domain and about the development of all relevant quantities at the lateral boundaries is required.

===Initial state===
To generate an initial state for the prognostic model, a diagnostic model (Kunz, R., 1991) is applied using measured temperature and wind data. Both data can be provided as:
* surface measurements i.e. single measurements directly above the surface (not necessary)
* upper air soundings (i.e., soundings that consist of two or more  measurements at different heights) at a constant geographical location is required (with at least one sounding for temperature and wind velocity).

===Time-dependent boundary conditions===
Information about quantities at the lateral boundaries can be taken into account as surface measurements and upper air soundings. Therefore, a key word and the time when boundary data is given must occur in front of a set of boundary information.

== Nesting facility ==
In MEMO, a one-way interactive nesting scheme is implemented. With this nesting scheme a coarse grid and a fine grid simulation can be nested. During the coarse grid simulation, data is interpolated and written to a file. A consecutive fine grid simulation uses this data as lateral boundary values.

'''Mathematical psychology''' is an approach to [[psychology|psychological]] research that is based on [[mathematical modeling]] of perceptual, thought, cognitive and motor processes, and on the establishment of law-like rules that relate quantifiable stimulus characteristics with quantifiable behavior. The mathematical approach is used with the goal of deriving hypotheses that are more exact and thus yield stricter empirical validations. Quantifiable behavior is in practice often constituted by task performance.

As quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor, the [[measurement|theory of measurement]] is a central topic in mathematical psychology.
Mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to [[psychometrics]]. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to [[experimental psychology]]/[[cognitive psychology]]/[[psychonomics]]. &lt;!--The models used are mostly probabilistic but there are also discrete ones.--&gt; Like [[computational neuroscience]] and [[econometrics]], mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way. Central themes from cognitive psychology; limited vs. unlimited processing capacity, serial vs. parallel processing, etc., and their implications, are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology. &lt;!--There are many subfields including [[measurement|theory of measurement]].--&gt;

Mathematical psychologists are active in many fields of psychology, especially in [[psychophysics]], [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensation]] and [[perception]], [[problem solving]], [[decision theory|decision-making]], [[learning]], [[memory]], and [[psycholinguistics|language]], collectively known as [[cognitive psychology]], and the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|quantitative analysis of behavior]] but also, e.g., in [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[music psychology|psychology of music]].
&lt;!--Some mathematical models include but are not limited to the [[matching law]], [[detection_theory|signal detection theory]], [[game theory]], [[behavioral economics]]]], etc.--&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ernst Heinrich Weber.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Ernst Heinrich Weber]].]]
[[Image:Gustav Fechner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Gustav Fechner]].]]

Mathematical modeling has a long history in psychology starting in the 19th century with [[Ernst Heinrich Weber|Ernst Weber]] (1795–1878) and [[Gustav Fechner]] (1801–1887) being among the first to apply successful mathematical technique of [[functional equations]] from physics to psychological processes. They thereby established the fields of [[experimental psychology]] in general, and that of [[psychophysics]] in particular.

Researchers in [[astronomy]] in the 19th century were mapping distances between stars by denoting the exact time of a star's passing of a cross-hair on a telescope. For lack of the automatic registration instruments of the modern era, these time measurements relied entirely on human response speed. It had been noted that there were small systematic differences in the times measured by different astronomers, and these were first systematically studied by German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]] (1782–1846). Bessel constructed ''personal equations'' from measurements of basic response speed that would cancel out individual differences from the astronomical calculations. Independently, physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] measured reaction times to determine nerve conduction speed.

These two lines of work came together in the research of Dutch physiologist [[Franciscus Donders|F. C. Donders]] and his student [[Johan Jacob de Jaager|J. J. de Jaager]], who recognized the potential of reaction times for more or less objectively quantifying the amount of time elementary mental operations required. Donders envisioned the employment of his ''[[mental chronometry]]'' to scientifically infer the elements of complex cognitive activity by measurement of ''simple reaction time''&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leahey |first=T. H. |year=1987 |title=A History of Psychology |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=Second |isbn=0-13-391764-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following is a set of loose points not well integrated with the main text. It interrupts the flow of the article and doesn't seem to serve a point -----------
In the United States, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] conducted experiments on reaction times, weight discrimination, and color perception. In the famous experiment on weight discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Peirce (with the assistance of [[Robert Jastrow]]) introduced important statistical methods, including
*[[Randomized controlled trial|the randomized assignment of treatments to subjects]], [[blind experiment]]s, and [[logistic regression]].

Peirce's experiment on reaction times invented a [[repeated measures design]] and used [[smoothing]]. Peirce's psycho-physical experiments are discussed in the statistical histories by [[Stephen Stigler#Books|Stephen Stigler]].
----------------------------------------------&gt;
The first psychological laboratory was established in Germany by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who amply used Donders' ideas. However, findings that came from the laboratory were hard to replicate and this was soon attributed to the method of [[introspection]] that Wundt introduced. Some of the problems resulted from individual differences in response speed found by astronomers. Although Wundt did not seem to take interest in these individual variations and kept his focus on the study of the ''general human mind'', Wundt's U.S. student [[James McKeen Cattell]] was fascinated by these differences and started to work on them during his stay in England.

The failure of Wundt's method of introspection led to the rise of different schools of thought. Wundt's laboratory was directed towards conscious human experience, in line with the work of Fechner and Weber on the intensity of stimuli. In the United Kingdom, under the influence of the anthropometric developments led by [[Francis Galton]], interest focussed on individual differences between humans on psychological variables, in line with the work of Bessel. Cattell soon adopted the methods of Galton and helped laying the foundation of [[psychometrics]].

===20th century===

In the United States, [[behaviorism]] arose in opposition to [[introspectionism]] and associated reaction-time research, and turned the focus of psychological research entirely to learning theory.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt; In Europe introspection survived in [[Gestalt psychology]]. Behaviorism dominated American psychology until the end of the [[Second World War]], and largely refrained from inference on mental processes. Formal theories were mostly absent (except for [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]).

During the war, developments in [[engineering]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[computability theory]], [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], and the military need to understand [[human factors|human performance and limitations]], brought together experimental psychologists, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and economists. Out of this mix of different disciplines mathematical psychology arose. Especially the developments in [[signal processing]], [[information theory]], [[linear systems]] and [[filter theory]], [[game theory]], [[stochastic processes]] and [[mathematical logic]] gained a large influence on psychological thinking.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002" /&gt;

Two seminal papers on learning theory in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' helped to establish the field in a world that was still dominated by behaviorists: A paper by Bush and Mosteller instigated the linear operator approach to learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The 1950s saw a surge in mathematical theories of psychological processes, including [[Luce's choice axiom|Luce's theory of choice]], Tanner and Swets' introduction of [[signal detection theory]] for human stimulus detection, and Miller's approach to information processing.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Batchelder |first=W. H. |year=2002 |chapter=Mathematical Psychology |editor-first=A. E. |editor-last=Kazdin |title=Encyclopedia of Psychology |location=Washington/NY |publisher=APA/Oxford University Press |isbn=1-55798-654-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1950s, the number of mathematical psychologists had increased from a handful by more than a tenfold, not counting psychometricians. Most of these were concentrated at the Indiana University, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Stanford.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2002"&gt;[http://www.mathpsych.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27 Estes, W. K. (2002). History of the Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were regularly invited by the U.S. Social Science Research Counsel to teach in summer workshops in mathematics for social scientists at Stanford University, promoting collaboration.

To better define the field of mathematical psychology, the mathematical models of the 1950s were brought together in sequence of volumes edited by Luce, Bush, and Galanter: Two readings&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). ''Readings in mathematical psychology. Volumes I &amp; II.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and three handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). Handbook of mathematical psychology. Volumes I-III''. New York: Wiley. [https://www.archive.org/download/handbookofmathem017893mbp/handbookofmathem017893mbp.pdf  Volume II from Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of volumes turned out to be helpful in the development of the field. In the summer of 1963 the need was felt for a journal for theoretical and mathematical studies in all areas in psychology, excluding work that was mainly factor analytical. An initiative led by [[Richard C. Atkinson|R. C. Atkinson]], [[R. R. Bush]], [[W. K. Estes]], [[R. Duncan Luce|R. D. Luce]], and [[P. Suppes]] resulted in the appearance of the first issue of the [[Journal of Mathematical Psychology]] in January, 1964.&lt;ref name="Estes2002"/&gt;

Under the influence of developments in computer science, logic, and language theory, in the 1960s modeling gravitated towards computational mechanisms and devices. Examples of the latter constitute so called [[cognitive architectures]] (e.g., [[Production system (computer science)|production rule system]]s, [[ACT-R]]) as well as [[connectionist]] systems or [[neural networks]].

Important mathematical expressions for relations between physical characteristics of stimuli and subjective perception are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] (which is now sometimes called Weber-Fechner Law), [[Ekman's Law]], [[Stevens' Power Law]], Thurstone's [[Law of Comparative Judgment]], the [[Signal detection theory|Theory of Signal Detection]] (borrowed from radar engineering), the [[Matching Law]], and [[Rescorla-Wagner model|Rescorla-Wagner rule]] for classical conditioning. While the first three laws are all [[deterministic]] in nature, later established relations are more fundamentally [[stochastic]]. This has been a general theme in the evolution in mathematical modeling of psychological processes: from deterministic relations as found in classical physics to inherently stochastic models.

''' National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering''' ('''NCREE'''; {{zh|c=國家地震工程研究中心}}) is an organisation found in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. Since Taiwan is located on the ridge of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[Philippine Plate|Philippine]] tectonic plates, it is highly [[seismic]]. The biggest earthquake in Taiwan in more than a century was 21 September 1999, also known as the [[Chi-Chi earthquake]] which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale. 
[[File:國家地震工程研究中心.JPG|right|thumb|National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering]]

NCREE was established in 1980 by the [[National Science Council]] (NSC), and they are working together with the [[National Taiwan University]] (NTU), as well as being part of the [[National Applied Research Laboratories]] ([http://www.narlabs.org.tw/tw/ NARL], a non-profit organisation established in June 2003), whose purpose to improve efficiency between research institutions, and they are trying to decrease the impact of earthquakes on various structures.

They have published books and printed reports with all their findings. This is to try raise public awareness. They also hold international seminars, make videos, and hold a design construction competition every year.

== Aims ==
NCREE is aiming to improve seismic resistant designs for all constructions and to provide feedback to the engineering community through research and development. The Center was built for researchers to collaborate and check their theories by doing various experiments.
Their goals are:

- Establish and provide research facilities.

- Develop and improve the seismic engineering database.

- Create and carry out regulations relating to seismic [[design code]]s.

- Co-ordinate and Integrate academic institutes and related industries.

- Introduce, Develop and Educate on seismic-resisting technology.

== Facilities ==
NCREE's seismic simulation laboratory has international standard facilities, such as eighteen sets of static hydraulic actuators and six sets of dynamic hydraulic actuators.

=== Seismic Simulation Shaking Table ===

[[Image:Shaking table.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shaking Table]]

The Tri-Axial Seismic Simulator, or [[Earthquake shaking table|Shaking Table]], can produce earthquake ground motions in six degrees of freedom, with motion in 3 axes.

The shaking table is 5m x 5m and has a mass of 27 tons. It can take models of large scale buildings weighing up to 50 tons, and the square shape of the table provides large bending and [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional stiffness]].

Small-scale or full-scale models are placed on the shaking table. To prevent the instrument vibration on surrounding areas during experiments, the shaking table has a [[base isolation|vibration isolation]] system, including 80 dampers, 96 airbags and air springs, and a reaction mass (16m x 16m x 7.6m, weighing about four thousand tons.)

Under the table are twelve actuators, which produce the shaking movement in six degrees of freedom. There are four actuators for each axis, and the hydraulic power is provided by two electrical pumps and three diesel pumps. The weight of the shaky table and the model is balanced by four static supports.

By doing these experiments, engineers can understand a structure's response to an earthquake. The results will show how stable the building is during earthquakes, and it will also accelerate the development of seismic isolation and minimize the damage caused by an earthquake.

=== Reaction Wall and Strong Floor ===

[[Image:Reaction wall.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Reaction Wall]]

The Reaction Wall and Strong floor make it possible to test multiple full-scale structural experiments. The wall can be used to perform seismic tests by using experimental methods, such as traditional quasi-static tests, cyclic loading tests and pseudo-dynamic tests.

The wall is L-shaped and has 4 sections: 15m x 15.5m, 12m x 15.5m, 9m x 12m and 6m x 12m.
The strong floor is a reinforced block of concrete 60m x 29m x 1.2m. The compressive strength of the concrete for both the reaction wall and the strong floor is 350&amp;nbsp;kg/cm2

During experiments, full-scale and large-scale constructions are mounted onto the strong floor. Hydraulic actuators then exert forces on the test objects, making it possible to see the resistance of various structures and performances of seismic isolators and energy dissipaters. The experimental data has helped proved that seismic theories can be applied, and are a reference to earthquake resistant building designs.

== Educating ==

[[Image:IDEERS 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|IDEERS 2007]]

To educate people about earthquakes, there are published books, printed reports, international seminars and videos.
NCREE also holds IDEERS and ITP to raise public awareness.

=== IDEERS ===
IDEERS stands for "Introducing and Demonstrating [[Earthquake engineering research|Earthquake Engineering Research]] in Schools" and is held every year by the British council in Taipei, NCREE and the Bristol University. It is a science-based project with a competition developed by the Earthquake Engineering Research Centre of the Bristol University. The students participating are undergraduate students majoring in civil engineering related subjects and high school students. Students entering the competition will make their models using cheap materials which then will be put on the tri-axial seismic simulator (shaking-table). Models will be shaken to destruction, and the best-designed models will win prizes.

=== ITP ===
ITP stands for The International Training Program (for Seismic Design of Structures and Hazard Mitigation) and is held by The National Science Council (NSC) and the Democratic Pacific Union. It is a short-term workshop to train government officials and engineers from different countries (In 2006, thirty-three people attended from fourteen different countries). The Program will try to improve the disaster-preventing technology and the earthquake-resisting ability of those countries and try reduce the impacts and losses caused by major earthquakes.

[[File:Sepia officinalis (aquarium).jpg|thumbnail|right|''Sepia officinalis'' (cuttlefish)]]
'''''Officinalis''''', or '''''officinale''''', is a [[Medieval Latin]] [[epithet]] denoting substances or [[organism]]s &amp;ndash; mainly [[plant]]s &amp;ndash; with uses in [[medicine]] and [[herbalism]]. It commonly occurs as a [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]] - the second term of a two-part botanical name. '''''Officinalis''''' is used to modify masculine and feminine nouns, while '''''officinale''''' is used for neuter nouns.

==Etymology==
The word ''officinalis'' literally means "of or belonging to an ''officina''", the storeroom of a monastery, where medicines and other necessaries were kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stearn, William T. |title=Botanical Latin |publisher=Timber Press (OR) |location= |year=2004 |page=456 |isbn=0-88192-627-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0hZvTFJUioC&amp;pg=PA456}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Officina'' was a contraction of ''opificina'', from ''opifex'' (gen. ''opificis'') "worker, maker, doer" (from ''opus'' "work") + -''fex'', -''ficis'', "one who does," from ''facere'' "do, perform".&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, entry  [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=officinalis&amp;searchmode=none "officinalis"], accessed May 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Linnaeus]] invented the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system of nomenclature]], he gave the specific name "officinalis", in the 1735 (1st Edition) of his [[Systema Naturae]], to plants (and  sometimes animals) with an established medicinal, culinary, or other use.&lt;ref&gt;Pearn J.,"On 'officinalis' the names of plants as one enduring history of therapeutic medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7888">A '''paraprosdokian''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ær|ə|p|r|ɒ|s|ˈ|d|oʊ|k|i|ə|n}}) is a [[figure of speech]] in which the latter part of a sentence, phrase, or larger discourse is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. It is frequently used for humorous or dramatic effect, sometimes producing an [[Climax (rhetoric)#Anticlimax|anticlimax]]. For this reason, it is extremely popular among comedians and satirists.&lt;ref name="glossary" /&gt; Some paraprosdokians not only change the meaning of an early phrase, but they also play on the [[double meaning]] of a particular word, creating a form of [[syllepsis]].

==Etymology==
"Paraprosdokian" comes from the Greek "[[wikt:παρά|παρά]]", meaning "against" and "[[wikt:προσδοκία|προσδοκία]]", meaning "expectation". The term "prosdokia" ("expectation") occurs with the preposition "para" in Greek rhetorical writers of the 1st century BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, with the meaning "contrary to expectation" or "unexpectedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Demetrius On Style, The Greek text of Demetrius De Elocutione |authorlink=Demetrius of Phalerum |author=Demetrius |editor=Roberts, W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11255">'''Predicted outcome value theory''' introduced in 1986 by Michael Sunnafrank, posits that people seek information in initial [[interactions]] and relationships to determine the benefits of [[interpersonal relationships]] by predicting the [[Value (economics)|value]] of future outcomes whether negative or positive.  If a person predicts a positive outcome in the relationship this can lead to increased [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], however if a person predicts a negative outcome then he or she would pursue limited interaction or possibly relationship termination.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn2&gt;Littlejohn, S. (2002). Theories of human communication. (7th Edition). China: Wadsworth Group.&lt;/ref&gt;  The processes of predicted outcome value directly link to continued relationship development and communication as well as stronger attraction and intimacy within the relationship.

Predicted outcome value theory proposes that initial interaction behaviors serve two related functions in individuals' attempts to maximize future relational outcomes. First, communication is directed at reducing uncertainty (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975) about new acquaintances to determine likely outcome-values for the relational future. Second, communication proceeds in a manner predicted to result in the most positive outcomes. In a broad sense, these outcome value predictions would lead to communicative attempts to terminate or curtail the conversation, to continue the entry-level conversation, or to escalate the conversation and relationship beyond this level. Attempts to continue or escalate would result from positive predicted outcome values, while attempts to terminate or curtail would result from negative predictions. Given this, predicted outcome value theory proposes that several specific behaviors associated with conversational termination-escalation should be related to predicted outcome value levels.
Among these, Sunnafrank (1986) posits that predicted outcome value is positively related to amount of verbal communication, intimacy level of communication content, nonverbal affiliative expressiveness, and liking.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (1988). "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations." Communication Research Reports, Vol 5. No 2, 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key propositions of predicted outcome value theory==

1. Attraction increases as the predicted outcome value increases&lt;br /&gt;
2. Prediction of positive future outcomes leads to future [[interactions]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Prediction of negative future outcomes ends future interactions&lt;br /&gt;
4. People focus and discuss topics in conversations that facilitate positive predicted outcomes&lt;ref name=Berger1&gt;Berger, C., Roloff, M., &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, D. (2010). The handbook of communication science. (2nd Edition). London: Sage Publication, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related==
Predicted outcome value theory is an alternative to [[uncertainty reduction theory]], which [[Charles Berger (academic)|Charles R. Berger]] and Richard J. Calabrese introduced in 1975. Uncertainty reduction theory states that the driving force in initial interactions is to collect information to predict [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behaviors]] for future relationship development.

Sunnafrank challenges [[uncertainty]] reduction theory with his predicted outcome value theory in that initial interactions are not solely about reducing uncertainty within the relationship but motivated by the predicted outcome value. Sunnafrank ascertains that initial interactions only lead to continued relationship development after the person has determined future rewards and costs of that relationship.

==Theory developer==
Michael Sunnafrank is a Professor in the Department of Communication, College of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Minnesota, Duluth]]. He joined the faculty at UMD in 1990 after fourteen years of teaching and research at [[Michigan State University]], [[University of California Davis]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. He was awarded his PhD and master's degrees by Michigan State University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d.umn.edu/comm/facultystaff/msunnafrank.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Sunnafrank continues to work on research testing predicted outcome value theory.

==Empirical support for predicted outcome value theory==
Sunnafrank's (1986) study examined a potential initial acquaintance association between perceived similarity and attraction may be present, though undetected, in previous interpersonal goals research and finds support for interpersonal goals claims regarding the perceived similarity/attraction relationship.
The findings extended Sunnafrank (1983, 1984, 1985) and Sunnafrank and Miller's (1981) claim that attitude similarity and attraction are unassociated in beginning communicative relationships. While their research supports this claim for attitude similarity revealed in pre-acquaintance, it also shows that this claim generalizes to more normally occurring perceptions of attitude similarity produced during initial relational stages. The results strongly suggested that traditional beliefs about, and theoretical interpretations of, the attitude similarity/attraction association are incorrect, at least regarding the initial acquaintance period.&lt;ref&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (Spring 1986). "Communicative Influences on Perceived Similarity and Attraction: An Expansion of the Interpersonal
Goals Perspective." ''The Western Journal of Speech Communication,'' 50, 158-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations", provided the initial test of several predicted outcome value theory (Sunnafrank, 1986) propositions. Findings supported all hypotheses tested, and demonstrated that during initial conversations predicted outcome value is strongly and positively related to the amount of verbal communication, intimacy of communication content, nonverbal affiliation, liking and perceived similarity.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"/&gt;

More recent research was designed to investigate positive and negative predictors of possible relationships by focusing on decisions to engage in future dates. [[Interpersonal attraction]], [[homophily]], and nonverbal immediacy have been linked to the predicted outcome value of relationships during initial encounters. This study investigates how these variables influence date decisions in a six-minute speed-dating experience. Results indicated [[interpersonal attraction]] and nonverbal immediacy significantly predict predicted outcome value, but not future date decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Marian L. Horan, Sean M. Furler, Lisa A. (2008). "Dating in the fast lane: How communication predicts speed-dating success." ''[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]'', Vol. 25, No. 5, 749-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featured research and theory development==

Michael Sunnafrank and Artemio Ramirez Jr., assistant professor of communication at [[Ohio State University]], conducted research which was published in the ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' in 2004 and also featured on [[ABC news]]. Sunnafrank and Ramirez studied 164 college freshmen over a nine-week period to determine the predicted outcome value of relationship development between strangers.&lt;ref name =Sunnafrank&gt;Sunnafrank, M. &amp; Ramirez, A., (2004). "At First Sight: Persistent Relational Effects of Get-Acquainted Conversations.” ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', Vol. 21. pp. 361-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study involved pairing two students of the same [[sex]] together the first day of class and introducing one another and then engaging in [[conversation]] for either three, six, or 10 minutes.  Afterwards, researchers asked each student to predict the outcome of the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] by describing it as a nodding [[acquaintance]], casual acquaintance, acquaintance, close acquaintance, friend, and close friend.   The students also completed extensive questionnaires about the other person to determine how much they liked one another (Sunnafrank &amp; Ramirez, 2004).

Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) facilitated a classroom environment that allowed the students to continue to get to know one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their [[behavior]] indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome.  If students decided after the initial [[interaction]] that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding [[eye contact]], and avoiding each other period.
 
Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. “People want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they are going to want to hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don’t want to waste our time.”&lt;ref name =Grabmeier&gt;Grabmeier, J. (2004). "First 10 minutes after meeting may guide future of relationship". Research Communications. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/1stimpre.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One important point to consider about this study is that Sunnafrank says that college freshmen can be “aggressive” in pursuing new friendships and relationships within social circles and that behavior tends to change over time. “In most situations in life, our time is pretty much claimed by work and family matters, so even when you meet people you really like, chances are not much is going to happen.  As life goes on and social networks become solidified, acting on that first impression becomes less likely.”&lt;ref name =Dye&gt;Dye, L. (2004). "First impressions really matter". ABCNEWS.COM. http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=69942&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnafrank concluded that other events throughout the course of relationships can change the predicted outcome value, which he calls “surprising events,” such as betraying one another’s trust by “back stabbing” and that not all relationships turn out as originally predicted. However, in this study, it is apparent that initial impressions and interactions can determine the outcome of the relationship, which is the predicted outcome value theory. While the college freshmen had numerous opportunities to develop their relationships over the nine-week period, the first impressions made lasting impacts.

The '''S-procedure''' or '''S-lemma''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] result that gives conditions under which a particular quadratic inequality is a consequence of another quadratic inequality. The S-procedure was developed independently in a number of different contexts&lt;ref&gt;Frank Uhlig, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0024-3795(79)90020-X A recurring theorem about pairs of quadratic forms and extensions: a survey]'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 25, 1979, pages 219–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imre Pólik and Tamás Terlaky, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S003614450444614X A Survey of the S-Lemma]'', SIAM Review, Volume 49, 2007, Pages 371–418.&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in [[control theory]], [[linear algebra]] and [[mathematical optimization]].

== Statement of the S-procedure == 
Let F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be symmetric matrices, g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be vectors and h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be real numbers. Assume that there is some x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that the strict inequality &lt;math&gt;x_0^T F_1 x_0 + 2g_1^T x_0 + h_1 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; holds. Then the implication 
::&lt;math&gt;x^T F_1 x + 2g_1^T x + h_1 \le 0 \Longrightarrow x^T F_2 x + 2g_2^T x + h_2 \le 0&lt;/math&gt;
holds if and only if there exists some nonnegative number λ such that 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda \begin{bmatrix} F_1 &amp; g_1 \\ g_1^T &amp; h_1 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} F_2 &amp; g_2 \\ g_2^T &amp; h_2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
is [[positive semidefinite matrix|positive semidefinite]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe ''[http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf Convex Optimization]'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.655.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science Media Centre of Canada''' (SMCC) was formally opened on September 27, 2010. It is located in [[Ottawa]].

The purpose of the centre is to serve [[journalist]]s with accurate information on [[science|scientific]] matters. The centre has a ''Research Advisory Panel'' of 20 [[Canadians|Canadian]] scientists who will make their expertise available in a simple and understandable manner. In order to secure objectivity, the centre has an ''Editorial Advisory Committee'' of eight journalists.
The centre is bilingual.

== Goal ==
The ultimate goal of SMCC is an "increased public engagement with science issues through media coverage of science that is more informed, more accurate and more incisive."

== Other SMCs ==
Science Media Centres exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre|UK]], [[Australian Science Media Centre|Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]]. The Science Media Centre of Canada is independent with respect to the other centres.

The '''septum transversum''' is a thick mass of cranial [[mesenchyme]], formed in the [[embryo]], that gives rise to parts of the [[thoracic diaphragm]] and the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut in the developed human being.

== Origins ==
The septum transversum originally arises as the most cranial part of the [[mesenchyme]] on day 22. During craniocaudal folding it assumes a position caudal to the developing heart at the level of the cervical vertebrae. During subsequent weeks the dorsal end of the embryo grows much faster than its ventral counterpart resulting in an ''apparent descent'' of the ventrally located septum transversum. At week 8 it can be found at the level of the thoracic vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;Persaud, T.V.N; Moore, K.L.: ''The Developing Human: Clinically oriented embryology''; Saunders, 7th ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nerve supply==
After successful craniocaudal folding the septum transversum picks up innervation from the adjacent [[ventral rami]] of spinal nerves C3, C4 and C5, thus forming the precursor of the [[phrenic nerve]]. During the descent of the septum, the [[phrenic nerve]] is carried along and assumes its descending pathway.

During embryonic development of the [[thoracic diaphragm]], [[myoblast]] cells from the septum invade the other components of the diaphragm. They thus give rise to the motor and sensory innervation of the muscular diaphragm by the [[phrenic nerve]].

== Derivatives ==
The [[cranium|cranial]] part of the septum transversum gives rise to the [[central tendon of diaphragm|central tendon]] of the diaphragm and is the origin of the [[myoblasts]] that invade the [[pleuroperitoneal]] folds resulting in the formation of the muscular diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N.A.; Roy, W.A.: ''Rapid Review Gross and Developmental Anatomy''; Mosby, 2nd ed., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the septum transversum is invaded by the [[hepatic diverticulum]] which divides within it to form the liver and thus gives rise to the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut, which in turn is the precursor of the [[lesser omentum]], the [[visceral peritoneum]] of the [[liver]] and the [[falciform ligament]].

Though not derived from the septum transversum, development of the liver is highly dependent upon signals originating here.  [[Bone morphogenetic protein 2]] (BMP-2), [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP-4]] and [[Bone morphogenetic protein 7|BMP-7]] produced from the septum transversum join [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) signals from the cardiac mesoderm induce part of the foregut to differentiate towards a hepatic fate.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, B: ''Human Embryology and Developmental Biology''.  Mosby, 3rd ed., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28915">'''Sex work''' is "the exchange of [[sexual services]], performances, or products for material compensation. It includes activities of direct physical contact between buyers and sellers as well as indirect sexual stimulation".&lt;ref name="Weitzer"&gt;''Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry'', edited by Ronald Weitzer, Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The term emphasizes the labor and economic implications of this type of work. Furthermore, some prefer the use of the term because it seemingly grants more agency to the sellers of these services. 
[[File:Red Light District.jpg|thumb|The Red Light district in Amsterdam]]

Because of the agency associated with the term, "sex work" generally refers to voluntary sexual transactions; thus the term does not refer to [[human trafficking]] and other coerced or nonconsensual sexual transactions.&lt;ref name="Trafficking"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alternet.org/story/84987/sex_work_vs._trafficking%3A_understanding_the_difference|title=Sex Work vs. Trafficking: Understanding the Difference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the legal status of some forms of sex work and the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with sex work, the population is difficult to access; thus there has been relatively little academic research done on the topic. Furthermore, the vast majority of academic literature on sex work focuses on [[prostitution]], and to a lesser extent, [[stripper|exotic dancing]]; there is little research on other forms of sex work. These findings cannot necessarily be generalized to other forms of sex work. Nonetheless, there is a long documented history of sex work and its personal and economic nature.

==Types==
Types of sex work include, but are not limited to, street prostitution, indoor prostitution (escort services, [[brothel]] work, massage parlor-related prostitution, bar or casino prostitution), [[phone sex]] operation, exotic dancing, [[lap dancing]], webcam nude modeling, [[pornographic film]] performing, and nude [[peepshow]] performing. The list is sometimes expanded to include jobs in the [[sex industry]] that less directly involve the sexuality of the worker in the exchange of sexual performances, services, and products, such as the producers and directors of adult films, manufacturers and sellers of [[sex toy]]s, managers in exotic dance clubs, escort agents, bouncers, etc.
[[File:Porn Set 5.jpg|thumb|On the set of a pornographic film]]

In 2004, a Medline search and review of 681 "prostitution" articles was conducted in order to create a global typology of types of sex work using arbitrary categories. 25 types of sex work were identified in order to create a more systematic understanding of sex work as a whole. Prostitution varies by forms and social contexts including different types of direct and indirect prostitution. This study as conducted in order to work towards improving the health and safety of [[sex worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, B. &amp; Harcourt, C. 2005. "The Many Faces of Sex Work." Sexually Transmitted Infections 81(3):201-206.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sex work, in many different forms, has been practiced since ancient times. It is reported that even in the most primitive societies, there was transactional sex. Prostitution was widespread in ancient Egypt and Greece, where it was practiced at various socioeconomic levels. [[Hetaera]] in Greece and [[geisha]] in Japan were seen as prestigious members of society for their high level of training in companionship. Attitudes towards prostitution have shifted through history. 
[[File:NAMA Courtisane &amp; client.jpg|thumb|An Ancient Greek urn depicts a prostitute and her client]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was tolerated but not celebrated. It wasn't until the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century that attitudes turned against prostitution on a large scale and bodies began to be regulated more heavily. These moral reforms were to a large extent directed towards the restriction of women's autonomy. Furthermore, enforcement of regulations regarding prostitution disproportionately impacted the poor.&lt;ref name="Ditmore"&gt;Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volumes 1 &amp; 2, edited by Melissa Hope Ditmore, Greenwood Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work has a long history in the United States, yet laws regulating the sale of sex are relatively new. In the 18th century, prostitution was deeply rooted from Louisiana to San Francisco. Despite its prevalence, attitudes towards prostitutes were negative and many times hostile. Although the law did not directly address prostitution at this time, law enforcement often targeted prostitutes. Laws against lewdness and [[sodomy]] were used in an attempt to regulate sex work. [[Red-light district]]s formed in the 19th century in major cities across the country in an attempt by sex workers to find spaces where they could work, isolated from outside society and corresponding stigma.

Ambiguity in the law allowed for prostitutes to challenge imprisonment in the courts. Through these cases prostitutes forced a popular recognition of their profession and defended their rights and property. Despite sex workers efforts, social reformers looking to abolish prostitution outright began to gain traction in the early 20th century. New laws focused on the third-party businesses where prostitution took place, such as saloons and brothels, holding the owners culpable for the activities that happened within their premises. Red-light districts began to close. Finally, in 1910 the [[Mann Act]], or "White Slave Traffic Act" made illegal the act of coercing a person into prostitution or other immoral activity, the first federal law addressing prostitution. This act was created to address the trafficking of young, European girls who were thought to have been kidnapped and transported to the United States to work in brothels, but criminalized those participating in consensual sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of American History: With the Complete Text of the Constitution of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqG-B4jsMIAC|first1=Michael Rheta|last1=Martin|first2=Leonard|last2=Gelber|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1978|isbn=9780822601241|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the start of the First World War, a Navy decree forced the closure of sex-related businesses in close proximity to military bases. Restrictions and outright violence led to the loss of the little control workers had over their work. In addition to this, in 1918, the Chamberlain-Kahn Act made it so that any woman found to have a [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) would be quarantined by the government. The original purpose of this act was to stop the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann|first1=Moseley|title=Cather Studies, Volume 11|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803296992|pages=384|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 under this act, prostitutes, or those perceived to be prostitutes could be stopped, inspected, and detained or sent to a rehabilitation facility if they were found to test positive for any venereal disease. During the [[World War I]], an estimate 30,00 women were detained and examined. The state had made sex workers into legal outcasts.&lt;ref name="Crime"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=Melissa Gira |title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America |url=https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america |website=[[AlterNet]] |accessdate=31 May 2018 |date=18 February 2013| author-link=Melissa Gira Grant }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], black women in New York City accounted for more than 50 percent of arrests for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanshard|first1=Paul|title=Negro Deliquency in New York|journal=The Journal of Educational Sociology|date=October 1942|volume=16|page=115-123|doi=10.237/2262442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of sex work expanded in the 21st century. Film and later the internet provided new opportunities for sex work. In 1978, [[Carol Leigh]], a prostitute and activist, coined the term "sex work" as it is now used. She looked to combat the anti-porn movement by coining a term that reflected the labor and economic implications of the work. The term came into popular use in the 1980s. (bayswan). [[COYOTE]] (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) and other similar groups formed in the 1970s and 80s to push for women's sexual freedom and [[sex workers' rights]]. A rift formed within feminism that continues today, with some arguing for the abolishment of sex work and others working for acceptance and rights for sex works.

The [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic presented a new challenge to sex workers. The criminalization of exposing others to AIDS significantly impacted sex workers. Harm reduction strategies were organized providing testing, counseling, and supplies to stop the spread of the disease. This experience organizing helped facilitate future action for social justice. The threat of violence persists in many types of sex work. Unionization of legal types of sex work such as exotic dancers, lobbying of public health officials and labor officials, and human rights agencies has improved conditions for many sex workers. Nonetheless, the political ramifications of supporting a stigmatized population make organizing around sex work difficult. Despite these difficulties, actions against violence and for increased visibility and rights persist drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.&lt;ref name="swaay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|title=Sex Work Activists, Allies, and You History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal status of sex work is reliant on the type of sex work and the location in question. In the United States sex work is largely regulated at the state level. Prostitution is illegal in almost every state, with Nevada being the only exception (see [[Prostitution law]]). Most other forms of sex work&amp;nbsp;– those which do not involve engagement in sex acts via bodily contact&amp;nbsp;– are legal if the sex worker is 18 or older and consenting.

==Emotional labor==
[[Emotional labor]] is an essential part of many service jobs, including many types of sex work. Through emotional labor sex workers engage in different levels of acting known as surface acting and deep acting. These levels reflect a sex worker's engagement with the emotional labor. Surface acting occurs when the sex worker is aware of the dissonance between their authentic experience of emotion and their managed emotional display. In contrast deep acting occurs when the sex worker can no longer differentiate between what is authentic and what is acting; acting becomes authentic.&lt;ref name="Hochschild"&gt;Hochschild, A. ''The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling'', University of California Press, LTD, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Woman lying on bed, looking at mirror, Berlin 2001.jpg|thumb|A prostitute in Berlin in 2001]]

Sex workers engage in emotional labor for many different reasons. First, sex workers often engage in emotional labor to construct performances of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, K. ''G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire'', Duke University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders |first=T. |year=2005 |title='It's Just Acting': Sex Workers' Strategies for Capitalizing of Sexuality |journal=Gender, Work, and Organization |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=319–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trautner |first=M. |year=2005 |title=Doing Gender, Doing Class: the Performance of Sexuality in Exotic Dance Clubs |journal=Gender and Society |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=771–788 |doi=10.1177/0891243205277253}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances frequently reflect the desires of a clientele which is mostly composed of heterosexual men. In the majority of cases, clients value women who they perceive as normatively feminine. For women sex workers, achieving this perception necessitates a performance of gender and (hetero)sexuality that involves deference to clients and affirmation of their [[masculinity]], as well as physical embodiment of traditional femininity.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis"&gt;Brewis, J., &amp; Linstead, S. ''Sex, Work and Sex Work'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional labor involved in sex work may be of a greater significance when race differences are involved. For instance Mistress Velvet, a black, femme [[dominatrix]] advertises herself using her most fetishized attributes. She makes her clients, who are mostly white cis males, read Black feminist theory before their sessions. This allows the clients to see why their participation, as white cis males, contributes to the fetishization of black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duberman|first1=Amanda|title=Meet The Dominatrix Who Requires The Men Who Hire Her To Read Black Feminist Theory|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mistress-velvet_us_5a822b50e4b00ecc923d4eba|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both within sex work and in other types of work, emotional labor is gendered in that women are expected to use it to construct performances of normative [[femininity]], whereas men are expected to use it to construct performances of normative masculinity.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt; In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. It fosters a better experience for the client and protects the worker thus enabling the worker to make the most profit.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sijuwade |first=P. |year=1996 |title=Counterfeit Intimacy: Dramaturgical Analysis of an Erotic Performance |journal=International Journal of Sociology of the Family |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=29–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sex workers often engage in emotional labor as a self-protection strategy, distancing themselves from the sometimes emotionally volatile work.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt; Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade" /&gt;

== Intimate relationships ==
A study in Melbourne, Australia found that sex workers typically experience relationship difficulties as a result of their line of work. This primarily stems from the issue of disclosure of their work in personal relationships. Some sex workers noted that dating ex-clients is helpful as they have had contact with sex workers and they are aware of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellhouse |first1=Clare |last2=Crebbin |first2=Susan |last3=Fairley |first3=Christopher K. |last4=Bilardi |first4=Jade E. |title=The Impact of Sex Work on Women’s Personal Romantic Relationships and the Mental Separation of Their Work and Personal Lives: A Mixed-Methods Study |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |website=PLOS ONE |accessdate=31 May 2018 |pages=e0141575 |language=en |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little empirical evidence characterizing clients of sex workers, but they may share an analogues problem. A Scientific American article on sex buyers summarises a limited field of research which indicates that Johns have a normal psychological profile matching the makeup of the wider male population, but view themselves as mentally unwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-buy-sex-2012-10-23|title=Why Do Men Buy Sex?|first=Nikolas|last=Westerhoff|date=1 October 2012|journal=Scientific American|volume=21|issue=2s|pages=60–65|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanbrain0512-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative studies indicate that repeat buyers become romantically attached and idealise sex workers of choice as their perfect partners.

=== Commodified intimacy ===
In clients' encounters with prostitutes or exotic dancers (and potentially other sex workers as well), many seek more than sexual satisfaction. They often seek, via their interactions with sex workers, an affirmation of their masculinity, which they may feel is lacking in other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; This affirmation comes in the form of (a simulation of) affection and sexual desire, and "smooth, intimate, affective space, wherein the way that time is managed is governed only by mutual desire and enjoyment."&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; Partly because they are engaged in work during these interactions, prostitutes' experience and interpretation of time tends to be structured instead by desires to maximize income, avoid boredom, and/or avoid detriment to self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt;

For sex workers, commodified intimacy provides different benefits. In Brazil, sex workers prioritize foreign men over local men in terms of forming intimate relationships with sex workers. This is a result of local men regarding sex workers as having no worth beyond their occupation. In contrast, foreign men are often accompanied by wealth and status, which are factors that can help a sex worker become independent. Hence sex workers in Brazil are more likely to seek out "ambiguous entanglements" with the foreign men they provide services for, rather than the local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Erica|title=Sex Tourism in Bahia: Ambiguous Entanglements|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252079443|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
Interviews with men and women escorts illuminate gender differences in these escorts' experiences.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; On average, women escorts charged much more than men.&lt;ref name="Fogg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://andrewfogg.com/2014/10/14/gender-differences-amongst-sex-workers-online/ | title=Gender differences amongst sex workers online | last=Fogg | first=A. | date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}} Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this disparity in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely than women to disclose their occupation.{{cn|date=September 2018}} This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients out of necessity, because the vast majority of clients are men.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt;

==Risks==
The potential risks sex work poses to the worker vary greatly depending on the specific job they occupy. Compared to outdoor or street-based sex workers, indoor workers are less likely to face violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krusi|first1=A|title=Negotiating safety and sexual risk reduction with clients in unsanctioned safer indoor sex work environments: a qualitative study|journal=Am J Public Health|date=Jun 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1154–9|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300638|pmid=22571708|pmc=3484819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street sex workers may also more likely to use addictive drugs, to have unprotected sex, and to be the victim of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; HIV affects large numbers of sex workers who engage in prostitution, of all genders, globally. Rape and violence, poverty, stigma, and social exclusion are all common risks faced by sex workers in many different occupations.&lt;ref name="Ditmore" /&gt; A study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04|title=Prostitution|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|pages=29|year=2008|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are also in a high risk of murder. According to Salfati's study, sex workers are 60 to 120 times more likely to be murdered than nonprostitute females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0886260507312946|pmid=18319375|title=Prostitute Homicides: A Descriptive Study|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=23|issue=4|pages=505|year=2008|last1=Salfati|first1=C.

==Feminist/liberalist debate==
{{POV-section|date=January 2017}}
Feminist debates on sex work (see [[Feminist views of pornography]] and [[Feminist views on prostitution|prostitution]]) focus primarily on pornography and prostitution. Feminist arguments against these occupations tend to be founded in the notion that these types of work are inherently degrading to women, perpetuate the sexual objectification of women, and/or perpetuate male supremacy.&lt;ref name="Dworkin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/aclu/dworkin/michlawjouri.html | title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy | last=Dworkin | first=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response, proponents of sex work argue that these claims deny women sex workers' agency, and that choosing to engage in this work can be empowering. They contend that the perspectives of anti-sex work feminists are based on notions of sexuality constructed by the patriarchy to regulate women's expressions sexuality.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell Davidson, J. ''Prostitution, Power, and Freedom.'' Polity Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many feminists who support the sex industry claim that criminalizing sex work causes more harm to women and their sexual autonomy. An article in the Touro Law Review 2014, focuses on the challenges faced by prostitutes in the U.S and the need for prostitution reform. "[By criminalizing prostitution] women lose the choice to get paid for having consensual sex. A woman may have sex for free, but once she receives something of value for her services, the act becomes illegal".&lt;ref&gt;Carrasquillo, Tesla. "Understanding Prostitution and the Need for Reform." Touro Law Review 30.3 (2014): 697-721. Ebscohost&lt;/ref&gt; Those who see this as an attack on a women's sexual autonomy also worry about the recent attacks on liberal social policy, such as same sex marriage and abortion on demand, in the U.S.  Paradoxically, liberals argue that since a disproportionate share of those who choose sex work as a means of income are the poor and disadvantaged, public officials should focus on social policies improving the lives of those choosing to do so rather than condemnation of the "private" means which those victims of society employ.&lt;ref name="Feministe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/29/7-key-american-sex-worker-activist-projects/ | title=Audacia Ray in Feministe "7 Key American Sex Worker Activist Projects"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debates on sex worker agency ===
The topic of sexual labor is often contextualized within opposing abolitionist and sex-positive perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|year=2015|title=Economies of Desire: Sexuality and the Sex Industry in the 21st Century|url=http://www.catherinehakim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EconomicAffairs-2015-Economies-of-Desire.pdf|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=35|pages=329–348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex|last=Bernstein|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionist perspective typically defines sex work as an oppressive form of labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comte|first=Jacqueline|year=2013|title=Decriminalization of Sex Work: Feminist Discourses in Light of Research|url=|journal=Sexuality and Culture|volume=|pages=196–217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to opponents of prostitution, it is not only the literal purchase of a person's body for sexual exploitation, it also constitutes exertion of power over women both symbolically and materially. This perspective views prostitution and trafficking as directly and intimately connected and therefore calls for the abolition of prostitution in efforts to eliminate the overall sexual exploitation of women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Opponents also refute the idea of consent among sex workers by claiming that such consent is merely a submissive acceptance of the traditional exploitation of women. For these reasons, opponents believe that the [[Decriminalizing sex work|decriminalization of sex work]] would utterly harm women as a class by maintaining their sexual and economic exploitation while "serving the interests of pimps, procurers and prostitutors".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sex-positive feminism|Sex positive feminists]] recognize sex workers as situated within a modern Western sexual hierarchy where a married man and woman are respected while transsexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, fetishists, and sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models are viewed as sexual deviants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|year=1984|title=Thinking Sex: Notes toward a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|url=|journal=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|volume=|pages=275–284|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sex positive feminists, sex law incorporates a prohibition against mixing sex and money in order to sustain this hierarchy. Therefore, the individuals who practice these "deviant" sexual acts are deemed as criminals and have limited institutional support and are subjected to economic sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sex-positive perspectives challenge this hierarchy by appreciating [[sexual diversity]] and rejecting any notion of "normal" sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Matters: Future Visions for a Sex-Positive Society|last=Windsor|first=Elroi|publisher=Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-93586-8|location=New York|pages=691–699|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this understanding, people who choose to engage in criminalized sex acts are seen as autonomous sexual beings rather than victims of the sex industry. For black women, agency is viewed as contextual due to historical considerations, and can be regarded as one facet of a complex system of ideals that encompass black women's sexuality over time. One result of this is the way that race relations impact the mobility of black people in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller-Young|first1=Mireille|title=A Taste for Brown Sugar, Black Women in Pornography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4_uBQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Duke University Press Book|isbn=978-0822358282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal feminists believe that a "democratic morality" should judge sexual activity (as if the proclivities of the majority, as well as their proficiency in providing sexual pleaure(s), should determine the direction of a society's moral compass) "by the way partners treat one another, the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They propound that it should not be an ethical concern whether sex acts are coupled or in groups, same or mixed sex, with or without consensual acts of violence or video, commercial or free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Soil conservation''' is the preventing of soil loss from [[erosion]] or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other unsustainable methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Borrelli|first2=Pasquale|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Alewell|first4=Christine|last5=Lugato|first5=Emanuele|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715001611|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=48|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Imeson|first2=Anton|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Borrelli|first4=Pasquale|last5=Poesen|first5=Jean|last6=Alewell|first6=Christine|date=2016-08-01|title=Soil Conservation in Europe: Wish or Reality?|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1547–1551|doi=10.1002/ldr.2538|issn=1099-145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Predicting soil erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed waterways|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Terrace Farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.

Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
It protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.&lt;ref&gt;''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, “Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion”, International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|right|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]

{{Main article|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981)   {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]]. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

Pagal Organisms In Soil
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]

When worms excrete [[faeces|egesta]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrizha]] and [[bacteria]].

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold '''20,000''' gallons more water per acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.

'''Sonari''' is the archaeological site of an ancient monastic complex of [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s. The site, positioned on a hill, is located about 10km southwest of [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name = "ASI"&gt; [http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/raisen_Sonari_buddhistacentland.html ASI Sonari page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The stupas were excavated around 1850 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], who discovered two boxes containing relics.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000546u00003a00.html British Library Online] &lt;/ref&gt; One of the reliquaries, which is very ornate, is visible nowadays at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

The reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in [[Brahmi]] mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] and [[Andher Stupas]]: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.&lt;ref name = "BA"&gt; Huu Phuoc's Buddhist Architecture The [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA148 p.148] &lt;/ref&gt; It would seem, then, that the ashes of these monks were divided between these three stupas.

The date of construction of Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 must therefore be equivalent to those of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]], i.e. 125-100 BCE.&lt;Ref name = "BA"/&gt;

There are in all four groups of stupas surrounding Sanchi within a radius of twenty kilometers: Bhojpur and Andher to the southeast, Sonari to the southwest, and Satdhara in the west. &lt;ref name ="BC"&gt; Buddhist Circuit in Central India: Sanchi, Satdhara, Sonari, Andher, Travel ... [https://books.google.fr/books?id=TOrKExVXXpkC&amp;pg=PT3&amp; p31 &lt;/ref&gt; Further south, about 100 km away, is [[Saru Maru]].

[[File:Sonari Stupa 2 reliquary.jpg|thumb|The main reliquary of Stupa No.2 at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/].]]
Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa No.2 in 1851. The stupa contained three miniature reliquaries, two in soapstone and one in rock crystal, as well as a certain amount of bone ash and a piece of wood. The main reliquary is shaped to resemble a [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] bud, with incised petals decorating the lower half of the reliquary. It was turned on a [[lathe]] and then carved in [[bas-relief]] with lotus petal strips on the shoulder and lower body, while on the upper body is a large area divided into eight rectangular compartments in each of which are an elephant, horse, deer or winged lion, patterns typical of the period of the [[Maurya Empire]]. These discoveries were published by A Cunningham in ''The Bhilsa Topes'' in 1854.&lt;ref name = "VA"&gt; Notice from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/] &lt;/ref&gt;

It had been customary since the death of the Buddha to preserve and venerate his relics. Under emperor [[Ashoka]] (around 268-233 BCE), converted to Buddhism and energetic protector of the faith, a series of stupas, mounds of relics, were erected throughout the empire, marking sites important in the life of the Buddha. This practice continued, and this container of relics was buried around 200 BCE. Relic deposits of this period usually represented original deposits of the relics of the Buddha.&lt;ref name = "VA"/&gt;

'''Taxonomy''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wiktionary:τάξις|τάξις]]'' ([[taxis]])|arrangement||''[[wiktionary:νόμος|-νομία]]'' ([[:wikt:-nomy|-nomia]])|[[Scientific method|method]]}}) is the [[science]] of defining and naming groups of biological [[organism]]s on the basis of shared characteristics. Organisms are grouped together into [[taxon|taxa]] (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a [[taxonomic rank]]; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy. The principal ranks in modern use are [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]] (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum), [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] and [[species]]. The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as [[Linnaean taxonomy]] for categorization of organisms and [[binomial nomenclature]] for naming organisms.

With the advent of such fields of study as [[phylogenetics]], [[cladistics]], and [[systematics]], the Linnaean system has progressed to a system of modern biological classification based on the [[evolution]]ary relationships between organisms, both living and extinct.

==Definition==
The exact definition of taxonomy varies from source to source, but the core of the discipline remains: the conception, naming, and classification of groups of organisms.&lt;ref name=Wilkins2011&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=J. S. |url=http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |title=What is systematics and what is taxonomy? |date=5 February 2011 |access-date=21 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827124330/http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/02/what-is-systematics-and-what-is-taxonomy/ |archivedate=27 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As points of reference, recent definitions of taxonomy are presented below:

#Theory and practice of grouping individuals into species, arranging species into larger groups, and giving those groups names, thus producing a classification.&lt;ref name="Judd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Judd |first1=W.

B.|date=1988|title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Science and Technology|publisher=W. R. Chambers Ltd. and Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"The analysis of an organism's characteristics for the purpose of classification"&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence |first=E.|date=2005|title=Henderson's Dictionary Of Biology|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131273849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PLgy6DWe0wC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"[[Systematics]] studies phylogeny to provide a pattern that can be translated into the classification and names of the more inclusive field of taxonomy" (listed as a desirable but unusual definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Quentin D. Wheeler |last=Wheeler |first=Quentin D. |date=2004 |chapter=Taxonomic triage and the poverty of phylogeny |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |title=Taxonomy for the twenty–first century |editor=H. C. J. Godfray &amp; S. Knapp |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=571–583 |pmid=15253345 |pmc=1693342 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The varied definitions either place taxonomy as a sub-area of systematics (definition 2), invert that relationship (definition 6), or appear to consider the two terms synonymous. There is some disagreement as to whether [[biological nomenclature]] is considered a part of taxonomy (definitions 1 and 2), or a part of systematics outside taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Herbarium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://herbarium.usu.edu:80/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123030604/http://herbarium.usu.edu/teaching/4420/botnom.htm |archive-date=23 November 2016 |date=2005 |title=Nomenclature, Names, and Taxonomy |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, definition 6 is paired with the following definition of systematics that places nomenclature outside taxonomy:&lt;ref name=Henderson/&gt;

*''Systematics'': "The study of the identification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa".

A whole set of terms including taxonomy, [[systematic biology]], systematics, [[biosystematics]], scientific classification, biological classification, and [[phylogenetics]] have at times had overlapping meanings – sometimes the same, sometimes slightly different, but always related and intersecting.&lt;ref name=Wilkins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Small1989&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Small |first=Ernest |date=1989 |title=Systematics of Biological Systematics (Or, Taxonomy of Taxonomy) |jstor=1222265 |journal=Taxon|volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=335–356 |doi=10.2307/1222265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadest meaning of "taxonomy" is used here. The term itself was introduced in 1813 by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|de Candolle]], in his ''Théorie élémentaire de la botanique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Gurcharan |date=2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=PA20 |via=Google Books |title=Plant systematics: An integrated approach |publisher=Science Publishers |isbn=978-1578083510 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monograph and taxonomic revision ===
A '''taxonomic revision''' or '''taxonomic review''' is a novel analysis of the variation patterns in a particular [[taxon]]. This analysis may be executed on the basis of any combination of the various available kinds of characters, such as morphological, anatomical, palynological, biochemical and genetic. A [[Monograph#In biology|monograph]] or complete revision is a revision that is comprehensive for a taxon for the information given at a particular time, and for the entire world. Other (partial) revisions may be restricted in the sense that they may only use some of the available character sets or have a limited spatial scope. A revision results in a conformation of or new insights in the relationships between the subtaxa within the taxon under study, which may result in a change in the classification of these subtaxa, the identification of new subtaxa, or the merger of previous subtaxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Nigel|last= Maxted|year= 1992|title= Towards Defining a Taxonomic Revision Methodology|journal= Taxon|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 653–660|jstor= 1222391|doi= 10.2307/1222391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpha and beta taxonomy ===
{{distinguish|Alpha diversity}}
The term "'''alpha taxonomy'''" is primarily used today to refer to the discipline of finding, describing, and naming [[taxon|taxa]], particularly species.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; In earlier literature, the term had a different meaning, referring to morphological taxonomy, and the products of research through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosselló-Mora|first=Ramon|last2=Amann|first2=Rudolf|date=1 January 2001|title=The species concept for prokaryotes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00571.x/abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=25|issue=1|pages=39–67|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00571.x|pmid=11152940|issn=1574-6976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Bertram Turrill]] introduced the term "alpha taxonomy" in a series of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Turrill&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turrill |first=W. B. |date=1938 |title=The Expansion Of Taxonomy With Special Reference To Spermatophyta|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=13|issue=4|pages=342–373|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1938.tb00522.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; … there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable … Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an "omega" taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a "beta" taxonomy.&lt;ref name=Turrill/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turrill thus explicitly excludes from alpha taxonomy various areas of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp.&amp;nbsp;365–366).

Later authors have used the term in a different sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steyskal |first=G. C. |date=1965 |title=Trend curves of the rate of species description in zoology |journal=Science |volume=149 |issue=3686 |pages=880–882 |pmid=17737388 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3686.880|bibcode=1965Sci...149..880S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; Thus, [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1968 defined '''beta taxonomy''' as the classification of ranks higher than species.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Role of Systematics in Biology: The study of all aspects of the diversity of life is one of the most important concerns in biology |author-link=Ernst Mayr |first=Ernst |last=Mayr |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3815/595.short |date=9 February 1968 |volume=159 |issue=3815 |pages=595–599 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3815.595 |pmid=4886900 |bibcode=1968Sci...159..595M |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142036/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3815/595.short |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species is even more important for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as '''beta taxonomy'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Microtaxonomy and macrotaxonomy===
{{main|Species problem}}
How species should be defined in a particular group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that are referred to as the [[species problem]]. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674364462 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC |chapter=Chapter 6: Microtaxonomy, the science of species}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508|title=Result of Your Query|date=|website=www.biological-concepts.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170414/http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1508|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373|title=Taxonomy: Meaning, Levels, Periods and Role|date=27 May 2016|work=Biology Discussion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073645/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/animals-2/taxonomy/taxonomy-meaning-levels-periods-and-role/32373|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher [[taxonomic rank]]s, from subgenus and above only, than species.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt;

==History==
While some descriptions of taxonomic history attempt to date taxonomy to ancient civilizations, a truly scientific attempt to classify organisms did not occur until the 18th century. Earlier works were primarily descriptive and focused on plants that were useful in agriculture or medicine. There are a number of stages in this scientific thinking. Early taxonomy was based on arbitrary criteria, the so-called "artificial systems", including Linnaeus's system of sexual classification. Later came systems based on a more complete consideration of the characteristics of taxa, referred to as "natural systems", such as those of [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), de Candolle (1813) and [[Bentham and Hooker]] (1862–1863). These were pre-[[evolution]]ary in thinking. The publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) led to new ways of thinking about classification based on evolutionary relationships. This was the concept of [[phyletic]] systems, from 1883 onwards. This approach was typified by those of [[August Eichler|Eichler]] (1883) and [[Adolf Engler|Engler]] (1886–1892). The advent of [[molecular genetics]] and statistical methodology allowed the creation of the modern era of "phylogenetic systems" based on [[cladistics]], rather than [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] alone.{{sfn|Datta|1988}}{{sfn|Stace|1989}}{{sfn|Stuessy|2009}}

===Pre-Linnaean===

====Early taxonomists====
Naming and classifying our surroundings has probably been taking place as long as mankind has been able to communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.&lt;ref name=Manktelow&gt;Manktelow, M.

Organisms were first classified by [[Aristotle]] ([[Greece]], 384–322 BC) during his stay on the [[Lesbos|Island of Lesbos]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. (1982) ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Belknap P. of Harvard U.P., Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palaeos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html|title=Palaeos : Taxonomy|date=|website=palaeos.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331022648/http://palaeos.com/taxonomy/history.html|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms ''attributes'', such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied.&lt;ref name="Roanoke"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm|title=Biology 101, Ch 20|date=23 March 1998|website=www.cbs.dtu.dk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628023508/http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/genomics_course/roanoke/bio101ch20.htm|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Some of his groups of animals, such as ''Anhaima'' (animals without blood, translated as [[invertebrate]]s) and ''Enhaima'' (animals with blood, roughly the [[vertebrate]]s), as well as groups like the [[shark]]s and [[cetacean]]s, are still commonly used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=384–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student [[Theophrastus]] (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]''. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized can be traced back to Theophrastus, such as ''[[Cornus (genus)|Cornus]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

====Medieval====
Taxonomy in the [[Middle Ages]] was largely based on the [[Aristotelian system]],&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; with additions concerning the philosophical and existential order of creatures. This included concepts such as the [[Great chain of being]] in the Western [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition,&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; again deriving ultimately from Aristotle. Aristotelian system did not classify plants or fungi, due to the lack of microscope at the time,&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; as his ideas were based on arranging the complete world in a single continuum, as per the ''scala naturae'' (the Natural Ladder).&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; This, as well, was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt; Advances were made by scholars such as [[Procopius]], [[Timotheos of Gaza]], [[Demetrios Pepagomenos]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Medieval thinkers used abstract philosophical and logical categorizations more suited to abstract philosophy than to pragmatic taxonomy.&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;

====Renaissance and Early Modern====

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], and the Enlightenment, categorizing organisms became more prevalent,&lt;ref name="Palaeos" /&gt;
and taxonomic works became ambitious enough to replace the ancient texts. This is sometimes credited to the development of sophisticated optical lenses, which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. One of the earliest authors to take advantage of this leap in technology was the Italian physician [[Andrea Cesalpino]] (1519–1603), who has been called "the first taxonomist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino|title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''De Plantis'' came out in 1583, and described more than 1500 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/deplantislibrixv00cesa |title=De plantis libri XVI |last1=Cesalpino |first1=Andrea |last2=Marescotti |first2=Giorgio |date=1583 |location=Florence |publisher=Apud Georgium Marescottum |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098|title=Andrea Cesalpino {{!}} Italian physician, philosopher, and botanist|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075220/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-Cesalpino#ref130098|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large plant families that he first recognized are still in use today: the [[Asteraceae]] and [[Brassicaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=International Edition Vegetables I: Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae (Handbook of Plant Breeding) |last=Jaime |first=Prohens |isbn=978-1441924742|date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the 17th century [[John Ray]] ([[England]], 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy|title=taxonomy {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075451/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably his greatest accomplishment was ''Methodus Plantarum Nova'' (1682),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ray|date=1682|title=Methodus plantarum nova|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/84226#page/7/mode/1up|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929060003/http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/84226#page/7/mode/1up|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. The next major taxonomic works were produced by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] (France, 1656–1708).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |title=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort {{!}} French botanist and physician |date= |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075951/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Pitton-de-Tournefort |archivedate=5 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work from 1700, ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'', included more than 9000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.&lt;ref name=Manktelow /&gt;

===The Linnaean era===
{{main|Linnaean taxonomy}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', Leiden, 1735]]
The Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778)&lt;ref name="Roanoke" /&gt; ushered in a new era of taxonomy. With his major works ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' 1st Edition in 1735,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1735) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species''. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753,&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1753) ''Species Plantarum''. Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|''Systema Naturae'' 10th Edition]],&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1758) ''Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species'', 10th Edition. Haak, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; he revolutionized modern taxonomy. His works implemented a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species,&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system|title=taxonomy - The Linnaean system {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405074215/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/The-Linnaean-system|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proved to be an elegant solution to a chaotic and disorganized taxonomic literature. He not only introduced the standard of class, order, genus, and&amp;nbsp;species, but also made it possible to identify plants and animals from his book, by using the smaller parts of the flower.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean" /&gt; Thus the [[Linnaean system]] was born, and is still used in essentially the same way today as it was in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Linnaean" /&gt; Currently, plant and animal taxonomists regard Linnaeus' work as the "starting point" for valid names (at 1753 and 1758 respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donk|first=M. A.|date=December 1957|title=Typification and later starting-points|journal=Taxon|volume=6|issue=9|pages=245–256|jstor=1217493|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf|doi=10.2307/1217493|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091529/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop018-019.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names published before these dates are referred to as "pre-Linnaean", and not considered valid (with the exception of spiders published in ''[[Svenska Spindlar]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Carl |first=Clerck |last2=Carl |first2=Bergquist |last3=Eric |first3=Borg |last4=L. |first4=Gottman |last5=Lars |first5=Salvius |date=1757 |title=Svenska spindlar |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209583#page/7/mode/1up |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201181959/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209583#page/7/mode/1up |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even taxonomic names published by Linnaeus himself before these dates are considered pre-Linnaean.&lt;ref name=Manktelow/&gt;

==Modern system of classification==
{{Main|Evolutionary taxonomy|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}

[[File:Cladogram vertebrata.jpg|thumb|right|The same relationship, expressed as a [[cladogram]] typical for [[cladistics]]]]

Whereas Linnaeus aimed simply to create readily identifiable taxa, the idea of the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] as translating into a sort of [[dendrogram]] of the animal and plant [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before ''On the Origin of Species'' was published.&lt;ref name="Britannica - Taxonomy" /&gt; Among early works exploring the idea of a [[transmutation of species]] were [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s 1796 ''[[Zoonomia|Zoönomia]]'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' of 1809.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; The idea was popularized in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', published anonymously by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Secord |first=James A. |date=2000 |title=Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14098.ctl |isbn=978-0-226-74410-0 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224806/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14098.ctl |archive-date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus|title=taxonomy - Classification since Linnaeus {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075916/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Classification-since-Linnaeus|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tree of life (science)|Tree of life]] representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was [[birds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-05-fossil-world-earliest-modern-bird.html|title=Fossil of world's earliest modern bird could help us understand the extinction of dinosaurs|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170159/https://phys.org/news/2015-05-fossil-world-earliest-modern-bird.html|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{better source|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the then newly discovered fossils of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and ''[[Hesperornis]]'', [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by [[Richard Owen]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T.

The [[cladistic]] method has emerged since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus" /&gt; In 1958, [[Julian Huxley]] used the term clade.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical [[evolutionary tree]], ignoring ranks.&lt;ref name="Britannica - since Linnaeus" /&gt; A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form.&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-class/phyletic/|title=What do terms like monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic mean?|last=Taylor|first=Mike|date=|website=www.miketaylor.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801072310/http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-class/phyletic/|archivedate=1 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncse.com/book/export/html/2206|title=Polyphyletic vs. Monophyletic|date=|website=ncse.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170039/https://ncse.com/book/export/html/2206|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. [[dinosaurs]], with birds as offspring group) are termed [[paraphyletic]],&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor" /&gt; while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called [[polyphyletic]].&lt;ref name="Mike Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE" /&gt; The ''[[PhyloCode|International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature]]'' or ''PhyloCode'' is intended to regulate the formal naming of [[clade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/|title=The PhyloCode|last=Queiroz|first=Philip D.

===Kingdoms and domains===
[[File:Biological classification L Pengo vflip.svg|thumb|right|The basic scheme of modern classification. Many other levels can be used; domain, the highest level within life, is both new and disputed.]]
{{Main|Kingdom (biology)}}
Well before Linnaeus, plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542|title=Kingdom Classification of Living Organism|date=2 December 2014|work=Biology Discussion|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405073641/http://www.biologydiscussion.com/biology/kingdom-classification-of-living-organism/5542|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five and six-kingdom systems being the most common.

[[Domain (biology)|Domains]] are a relatively new grouping. First proposed in 1977, [[Carl Woese]]'s [[three-domain system]] was not generally accepted until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea|title=Carl Woese {{!}} Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology|date=|website=www.igb.illinois.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428163950/http://www.igb.illinois.edu/about/archaea|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called [[Monera]]),&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt; with the [[Eukaryota]] for all organisms whose cells contain [[Nucleus (biology)|a nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cracraft, Joel and Donaghue, Michael J. (eds.) (2004). ''Assembling the Tree of Life''. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195172345}}. pp. 45, 78, 555&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.&lt;ref name="Kingdom classification" /&gt;

[[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], who has published extensively on the classification of [[protist]]s, has recently proposed that the [[Neomura]], the clade that groups together the Archaea and [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]]&lt;!--yeah, Woese used a 'c' here--&gt;, would have evolved from Bacteria, more precisely from [[Actinobacteria]]. His 2004 classification treated the [[archaeobacteria]] as part of a subkingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, i.e. he rejected the three-domain system entirely.&lt;ref name="CavalierSmith2004"/&gt; Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five "dominion" system, adding [[Prion]]obiota (acellular and without nucleic acid) and [[Virus]]obiota (acellular but with nucleic acid) to the traditional three domains.&lt;ref name=Luketa2012&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luketa |first=S. |title=New views on the megaclassification of life |journal=Protistology |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=218–237 |url=http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150257/http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num7_4/luketa_protistology_7-4.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent comprehensive classifications===
Partial classifications exist for many individual groups of organisms and are revised and replaced as new information becomes available; however, comprehensive treatments of most or all life are rarer; two recent examples are that of Adl et al., 2012,&lt;ref name="Adl-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adl |first1=S.

==Application==
Biological taxonomy is a sub-discipline of [[biology]], and is generally practiced by biologists known as "taxonomists", though enthusiastic [[Natural history|naturalists]] are also frequently involved in the publication of new taxa.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Because taxonomy aims to describe and organize [[life]], the work conducted by taxonomists is essential for the study of [[biodiversity]] and the resulting field of [[conservation biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Natural History Museum|title=What is taxonomy?|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152618/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/taxonomy-systematics/what-is-taxonomy/index.html|archive-date=1 October 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McNeely |first=Jeffrey A. |date=2002 |title=The role of taxonomy in conserving biodiversity |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b06/e3d09692ef9f2b464fbfb7807ff32a35ce47.pdf |journal=J.

Biological classification is a critical component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): [[Domain (biology)|Domain]], [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]], [[Phylum]], [[Class (biology)|Class]], [[Order (biology)|Order]], [[Family (biology)|Family]], [[Genus]], [[Species]], and [[Strain (biology)|Strain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/|title=Mnemonic taxonomy / biology: Kingdom Phylum Class Order...|date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606171902/https://www.mnemonic-device.com/biology/taxonomy/domain-kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species/|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This ranking system can be remembered by the mnemonic "Do Kings Play Chess On Fine Glass Sets?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomic descriptions===
{{see also|Species description}}
[[File:Nepenthes smilesii type specimen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Type specimen for ''[[Nepenthes smilesii]]'', a tropical [[pitcher plant]].]]
The "definition" of a taxon is encapsulated by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set rules governing the definition of taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules.&lt;ref name="Herbarium" /&gt; In [[zoology]], the [[nomenclature]] for the more commonly used ranks ([[Superfamily (taxonomy)|superfamily]] to [[subspecies]]), is regulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN Code'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/loadcachedpage?url=animalbase-code.html|title=ICZN Code|date=|website=www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[botany]], [[phycology]], and [[mycology]], the naming of taxa is governed by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICN'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|date=|website=www.iapt-taxon.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111104255/http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php|archivedate=11 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial description of a taxon involves five main requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |title=How can I describe new species? |url=http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133052/http://iczn.org/content/how-can-i-describe-new-species |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The taxon must be given a name based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet (a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] for new species, or uninomial for other ranks).
#The name must be unique (i.e. not a [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]).
#The description must be based on at least one name-bearing [[Type (biology)|type]] specimen.
#It should include statements about appropriate attributes either to describe (define) the taxon or to differentiate it from other taxa (the diagnosis, ''ICZN Code'', Article 13.1.1, ''ICN'', Article 38). Both codes deliberately separate defining the content of a taxon (its [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]) from defining its name.
#These first four requirements must be published in a work that is obtainable in numerous identical copies, as a permanent scientific record.

However, often much more information is included, like the geographic range of the taxon, ecological notes, chemistry, behavior, etc. How researchers arrive at their taxa varies: depending on the available data, and resources, methods vary from simple [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] comparisons of striking features, to elaborate computer analyses of large amounts of [[DNA sequence]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|title=taxonomy – Evaluating taxonomic characters {{!}} biology|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405080431/https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy/Evaluating-taxonomic-characters|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author citation===
{{main|Author citation (botany)|Author citation (zoology)}}
An "authority" may be placed after a scientific name.&lt;ref name="AJE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/|title=Editing Tip: Scientific Names of Species {{!}} AJE {{!}} American Journal Experts|date=|website=www.aje.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021714/http://www.aje.com/en/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority is the name of the scientist or scientists who first validly published the name.&lt;ref name="AJE" /&gt; For example, in 1758 Linnaeus gave the [[Asian elephant]] the scientific name ''Elephas maximus'', so the name is sometimes written as "''Elephas maximus'' Linnaeus, 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html|title=Carolus Linnaeus: Classification, Taxonomy &amp; Contributions to Biology – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|date=|website=Study.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021600/http://study.com/academy/lesson/carolus-linnaeus-classification-taxonomy-contributions-to-biology.html|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of authors are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation ''L., for Linnaeus,'' is commonly used.

==Phenetics==
{{Main|Phenetics}}
In phenetics, also known as taximetrics, or numerical taxonomy, organisms are classified based on overall similarity, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="BiologyDiscussion" /&gt; It results in a measure of evolutionary "distance" between taxa. Phenetic methods have become relatively rare in modern times, largely superseded by cladistic analyses, as phenetic methods do not distinguish common ancestral (or [[plesiomorph]]ic) traits from new common (or apomorphic) traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|title=Classification|last=|first=|date=|publisher=North Carolina State University|access-date=27 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414163250/https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/classification/classification16.htm|archivedate=14 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain phenetic methods, such as [[neighbor joining]], have found their way into cladistics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as [[Bayesian inference]]) are too computationally expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/mcdgloss.html|title=Molecular Marker Glossary|date=|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610123503/http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/McDGloss.html|archivedate=10 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases==
{{main|Taxonomic database}}
Modern taxonomy uses [[database]] technologies to search and catalogue classifications and their documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Dylan|last2=King|first2=Margaret|last3=Landis|first3=Drew|last4=Courtney|first4=William|last5=Wang|first5=Runtang|last6=Kelly|first6=Ross|last7=Turner|first7=Jessica A.|last8=Calhoun|first8=Vince D.|date=26 August 2014|title=Harnessing modern web application technology to create intuitive and efficient data visualization and sharing tools|journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics|volume=8|pages=71|doi=10.3389/fninf.2014.00071|issn=1662-5196|pmc=4144441|pmid=25206330}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no commonly used database, there are comprehensive databases such as the ''[[Catalogue of Life]]'', which attempts to list every documented species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/about/|title=About – The Plant List|date=|website=www.theplantlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue listed 1.64 million species for all kingdoms as of April 2016, claiming coverage of more than three quarters of the estimated species known to modern science.&lt;ref name="About the Catalogue of Life"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Catalogue of Life: 2016 Annual Checklist |url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/about |work=Catalogue of Life |publisher=[[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] (ITIS) |access-date=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515032942/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/about |archivedate=15 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35143">'''Terrestrial analogue sites''' (also called "'''space analogues'''") are places on Earth with assumed past or present geological, environmental or biological conditions of a celestial body such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. Analogue sites are used in the frame of space exploration to either study geological or biological processes observed on other planets, or to prepare astronauts for surface [[extra-vehicular activity]].

==Definition==

[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] analogue site that gained recent scientific interest due to the presence of [[extremophile]] [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] that dwell in the water&lt;ref&gt;Similar extremophile archaea are [[Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Analogue sites are places '''on Earth''' with assumed, past or present, geological, environmental or biological conditions of a celestial body. Analogue site studies are necessary because they help to understand geological processes (on Earth) which can be extrapolated to other [[solar system]] bodies in order to interpret and validate the data received from [[orbiter]]s or planetary [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]]. Analogue sites are also important for optimizing scientific and technological needs and exploration strategies in robotic or manned missions to the Moon or Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Léveillé Richard, ''Validation d'instrumentation spatiale dans les sites analogues'', Canadian Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of space analogues is therefore rather vast, reaching from places on Earth that exhibit geologic or atmospheric characteristics which are close to those observed on other celestial bodies, to sites that are used for space mission simulations to test sampling or drilling equipment, [[space suit]]s, or the performance of [[astronaut]]s in reduced gravity.

Some sites are therefore suited to test instruments for exobiological research or to train sampling procedures for field explorations. Other sites offer an extreme environment that can be used by astronauts to prepare for the difficulties in future space missions.

===Fidelity===
An important notion in the evaluation of analogue sites is that of "fidelity", which describes the resemblance of the analogue to its extraterrestrial correspondent. Fidelity is used in comparative [[planetary science]] to express the analogy of a terrestrial site to a target extraterrestrial surface. This classification is possible based on various criteria such as [[geomorphology]], [[geochemistry]], [[exobiology]] or exploration conditions.

====Geomorphology====
Geomorphology is the scientific study of [[landform]]s and the processes that shape them. In terms of analogue sites, scientists search for locations on Earth that exhibit similar landforms such as can be found on exploration targets like the [[Moon]], [[Mars]] or even [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s. The idea is to confront astronauts, robots or scientific equipment with sites that resemble in their geologic appearance those extraterrestrial surfaces. Examples are volcanic sites which resemble lunar terrain ([[regolith]]), polar locations and [[glacier]]s that can be compared to the poles of Mars or of [[Jupiter]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], or terrestrial [[lava tube]]s which can also be found on the Moon or Mars.

====Geochemistry====
Geochemistry is the science that uses the principles of [[chemistry]] to explain the mechanisms behind major geological systems. The aspect of geochemistry is of importance for analogue sites when locations offer the possibility to test analysis instruments for future space missions (manned or robotic). Geochemical fidelity is also of importance for the development and test of equipment used for [[in-situ resource utilization]]. Examples for such analogue sites are terrestrial volcanoes that offer rocks similar to those found on the Moon or [[hematite]] concretions which can be found in Earth deserts and also on Mars (so-called "Blueberries").

====Exobiology====
Exobiology or astrobiology is the study of the origin and evolution of [[extraterrestrial life]]. In terrestrial analogues efforts are put on the identification of so-called [[extremophile]] organisms, which are life forms that live and survive in extreme conditions such as can be found on other planets or moons. The objective of this research is to understand how such organisms survive and how they can be identified (or their remnants).

Examples of exobiology analogue sites are the [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]], which hosts [[bacteria]] that can survive high temperatures and harsh chemical conditions, or [[hydrothermal vent|black smokers]] in the deep sea that host colonies of life forms in high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The [[Present day Mars habitability analogue environments on Earth#Atacama desert arid core|cold dry hyperarid core of the Atacama desert]] is one of our closest analogues for Martian surface conditions and is often used for testing rovers and life detection equipment that one day may be sent to Mars.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3242637|last1=Parro|first1=Victor|last2=de Diego-Castilla|first2=Graciela|last3=Moreno-Paz|first3=Mercedes|last4=Blanco|first4=Yolanda|last5=Cruz-Gil|first5=Patricia|last6=Rodríguez-Manfredi|first6=José A.|last7=Fernández-Remolar|first7=David|last8=Gómez|first8=Felipe|last9=Gómez|first9=Manuel J.|last10=Rivas|first10=Luis A.|last11=Demergasso|first11=Cecilia|last12=Echeverría|first12=Alex|last13=Urtuvia|first13=Viviana N.|last14=Ruiz-Bermejo|first14=Marta|last15=García-Villadangos|first15=Miriam|last16=Postigo|first16=Marina|last17=Sánchez-Román|first17=Mónica|last18=Chong-Díaz|first18=Guillermo|last19=Gómez-Elvira|first19=Javier|title=A Microbial Oasis in the Hypersaline Atacama Subsurface Discovered by a Life Detector Chip: Implications for the Search for Life on Mars|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=10|year=2011|pages=969–996|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0654|bibcode=2011AsBio..11..969P|pmid=22149750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues2&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University|title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 2.6.1|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf|publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AtacamaMicrobialOasis&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-02/f-sf-mod021612.php Microbial oasis discovered beneath the Atacama Desert], PUBLIC RELEASE: 16 FEB 2012, [[FECYT]] - SPANISH FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars rover tests driving, drilling and detecting life in Chile's high desert|url=http://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/mars-rover-tests-driving-drilling-detecting-life-chiles-high-desert/|website=Nasa Astrobiology Magazine|date=Mar 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Tests Life-Detection Drill in Earth’s Driest Place|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasa-tests-life-detection-drill-in-earth-s-driest-place|website=NASA Press Release|date=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists can test at such analogue sites sampling equipment designed to search and identify lifeforms.

====Exploration conditions====
Another criterion to search for analogue sites are locations where the exploration conditions of future astronauts can be simulated. Future explorers of the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]] will have to handle various conditions, such as reduced [[gravity]], [[radiation]], work in pressurized [[space suit]]s and extreme temperatures. Preparing astronauts for these conditions calls for training on sites that exhibit some of those conditions. The operations that can be simulated reach from living in isolation, to [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) in reduced gravity to the construction of habitats. Examples for analogue sites that offer such exploration conditions are research stations at the poles or underwater EVA training as it is done at [[NEEMO]] by [[NASA]], or at the Marseilles subsea analogue by [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|COMEX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012| title = Simulation and preparation of surface EVA in reduced gravity at the Marseilles Bay subsea analogue sites | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2012.06.022 | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume =  74| issue = | pages =  121–134| bibcode=2012P&amp;SS...74..121W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underwater analogue sites allow for the training of astronauts in neutral buoyancy conditions (such as is done in test pools at NASA, ESA or Star City in Russia) while operating on a natural terrain. Potential targets for such training are missions to the Moon and Mars, to test sampling, drilling and field explorations in 1/6th or 1/3rd of Earth's gravity, or asteroids, and to test anchoring systems in microgravity.

==History of the space analogues==
The notion of space analogues is not new. [[NASA]] has used such sites for a long time to train its astronauts for space missions. The following data are taken from the official website of NASA.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;''NASA's analog missions'', http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/563511main_NASA-Analog-Missions-06-2011_508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first analog mission was undertaken in 1997 in [[Arizona]]. Since then, NASA leads annual missions there to evaluate and test EVAs and outpost systems and operations. This site was chosen to test the materials in a desolate environment with rugged terrain, dust storms, extreme temperatures...

In the same year, the Haughton-Mars Project (HMP) was started on [[Devon Island]] in the Arctic. Since then, 14 missions have been conducted there to test technology and operations in a remote, extreme environment and conduct science research on the Mars-like terrain.

In 2001, NASA conducted the mission named [[NEEMO]] near [[Florida]], {{convert|62|ft}} underwater, that was supposed to be a simulation for six aquanauts living in a confined space. It was also the way to test the exploration equipment in an extreme and isolated environment. Since 2001, 14 missions have been undertaken there in a multi-organizational environment.

Since 2004, two-week missions are conducted every summer in [[Pavilion Lake]] in [[Canada]]. This analogue site allows astronauts to train in searching for evidence of life in an extreme environment with reduced-gravity conditions. This is an international and multi-organizational project conducted underwater.

The last analogue site used by NASA is at [[Mauna Kea]] on the Big Island of Hawaii. Two missions have already been undertaken, and another one was expected in 2012. This project was led to test technologies for sustaining human exploration on desolate planetary surfaces like the Moon or Mars.

Keen interest for space analogues has emerged through the student community, the 2017 [[NASA Ames]] Grand Prize Winning entry [https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Contest/Results/2017/Anastasi.pdf Anastasi], explores the possibility of an underwater settlement as a preliminary to space settlement infrastructure.

==Objectives==
The history of the use of terrestrial analogues shows the importance attached to using analogue sites in validating spatial technologies and scientific instruments. But analogue sites also have other uses:

=== Training===
Space analogues can help to train personnel in using technologies and instruments, and in knowing how to behave with a spacesuit. Thus two types of analogue sites exist: underwater sites and surface sites.

* Underwater sites simulate a reduced-gravity environment by compensating [[weight]] by the [[Archimedes' principle]], thus simulating zero gravity or reduced gravity (lunar gravity, for example).
* Surface sites serve to train astronauts to walk and move within a spacesuit, and to test the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (for example). Expeditions to surface sites also help teach geology to astronauts, who mostly trained as pilots.

===Exobiology===

Space analogues may have potential similarities to environments for exobiology. In some places on Earth the conditions allow only certain types of organisms - [[extremophile]] organisms - to live.

The '''E and B Experiment''' ('''EBEX''') will measure the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] of a part of the sky during two sub-orbital [[high-altitude balloon|(high-altitude) balloon]] flights. It is an experiment to make large, high-fidelity images of the CMB polarization anisotropies. By using a telescope which flies at over 42,000 metres high, it is possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allows massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a small part of the sky can be scanned and for shorter duration than a typical satellite mission such as [[WMAP]].

The first flight was an engineering flight over [[North America]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="spie2010"&gt;{{cite conference

==Instrumentation==
EBEX consists of a 1.5 m Dragone-type telescope that provides a resolution of 8 arcminutes in frequency bands centered on 150, 250, and 410&amp;nbsp;GHz.  Polarimetry is achieved with a continuously-rotating achromatic half-wave plate supported by a superconducting [[magnetic bearing]] and a fixed wire grid polarizer.  The wire grid is mounted at 45 degrees to the incoming light beam and transmits one polarization state while reflecting the other.  Each polarization state is subsequently detected by its own focal plane with a 6 degree instantaneous field-of-view on the sky.  Each of the focal planes contains up to 960 [[transition-edge sensor]]s read out with frequency-domain [[SQUID]] multiplexing.

==Temporary disappearance==
The EBEX telescope was reported missing in May, 2012, while in transit from the [[University of Minnesota]] to the NASA
[[Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility]] in [[Palestine, Texas]]. The driver of the truck said that the trailer had been stolen while parked at a motel in [[Dallas]]. Scientists and employees of the trucking company searched the area and found the missing trailer parked at a truck wash near [[Hutchins, Texas]]. The trailer had been opened, but no scientific equipment had been stolen and the telescope was undamaged.&lt;ref name="missing_universetoday"&gt;{{cite news

"'''The Triple Revolution'''" was an [[Open letter|open memorandum]] sent to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and other government figures on March 22, 1964. Drafted under the auspices of the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], it was signed by an array of noted [[social activist]]s, professors, and technologists who identified themselves as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution. The chief initiator of the proposal was [[Wilbur H. Ferry|W. H. "Ping" Ferry]], at that time a vice-president of CSDI, basing it in large part on the ideas of the futurist [[Robert Theobald]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' (Basic Books, 2008), p.462n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The statement identified three [[revolution]]s underway in the world: the ''cybernation revolution'' of increasing [[automation]]; the ''weaponry revolution'' of [[mutually assured destruction]]; and the ''[[human rights]] revolution''. It discussed primarily the cybernation revolution. The committee claimed that machines would usher in "a system of almost unlimited productive capacity" while continually reducing the number of [[manual labor]]ers needed, and increasing the skill needed to work, thereby producing increasing levels of [[unemployment]]. It proposed that the government should ease this transformation through large-scale [[public works]], [[affordable housing|low-cost housing]], [[public transit]], [[electric power|electrical power]] development, [[income redistribution]], union representation for the unemployed, and government restraint on technology deployment.

==Legacy==

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s final Sunday sermon, "Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution," delivered days before [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|his assassination]], explicitly references the thesis of "The Triple Revolution":&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of the Robots |last=Ford |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Ford (author) |isbn=0465059996 |pages=29–30 |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sermon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/remaining_awake_through_a_great_revolution/ |title=Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |date=March 31, 1968 |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There can be no gainsaying of the fact that a great revolution is taking place in the world today. In a sense it is a triple revolution: that is, a technological revolution, with the impact of automation and cybernation; then there is a revolution in weaponry, with the emergence of atomic and nuclear weapons of warfare; then there is a human rights revolution, with the freedom explosion that is taking place all over the world. Yes, we do live in a period where changes are taking place. And there is still the voice crying through the vista of time saying, "Behold, I make all things new; former things are passed away."|Martin Luther King, Jr.|Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution}}

In [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1967 anthology ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'', [[Philip José Farmer]]'s story "[[Riders of the Purple Wage]]" uses the Triple Revolution document as the premise of a future society, in which the "purple wage" of the title is a [[guaranteed income]] dole on which most of the population lives. At the 1968 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in San Francisco, Farmer delivered a lengthy Guest of Honor speech in which he called for the founding of a grassroots activist organization called REAP which would work for implementation of the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendations.

Looking back on the proposal in his 2008 book,&lt;ref name="Bell_2008"/&gt; [[Daniel Bell]] wrote: {{quote|"the cybernetic revolution quickly proved to be illusory.  There were no spectacular jumps in productivity. &lt;...&gt;  Cybernation had proved to be one more instance of the penchant for overdramatizing a momentary innovation and blowing it up far out of proportion to its actuality. &lt;...&gt; The image of a completely automated production economy—with an endless capacity to turn out goods—was simply a social-science fiction of the early 1960s. Paradoxically, the vision of Utopia was suddenly replaced by the spectre of Doomsday. In place of the early-sixties theme of endless plenty, the picture by the end of the decade was one of a fragile planet of limited resources whose finite stocks were being rapidly depleted, and whose wastes from soaring industrial production were polluting the air and waters."&lt;ref name="Bell_2008"&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' (Basic Books, 2008), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 2015 book ''Rise of the Robots'',&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] claims The Triple Revolution's predictions of steady decline in future employment were not wrong, but rather premature. He cites "Seven Deadly Trends" that began in the 1970s-1980s and by the mid 2010s appeared set to continue:
# Stagnation in [[real wages]] [[File:US productivity and real wages.jpg|thumb|U.S. productivity and average real earnings, 1947–2008]]
# Decline in labor's share of national income in many countries (breakdown of [[Bowley's law]]), while corporate profits increased
# Declining [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation]]
# Diminishing job creation, lengthening [[Jobless recovery|jobless recoveries]], and soaring [[Unemployment#Long-term unemployment|long-term unemployment]]
# [[Economic inequality|Rising inequality]]
# Declining incomes, and [[underemployment]] for recent college graduates
# [[Polarization_(economics)|Polarization]] and part-time jobs (middle-class jobs are disappearing, to be replaced by a small number of high-paying jobs and large number of low-paying jobs)
According to Ford, the 1960s were part of what in retrospect seems like a golden age for labor in the United States, when productivity and wages rose together in near lockstep, and unemployment was low. But after about 1980, wages began stagnating while productivity continued to rise. Labor's share of the economic output began to decline. Ford describes the role that automation and information technology play in these trends, and how new technologies including [[Weak AI|narrow AI]] threaten to destroy jobs faster than displaced workers can be retrained for new jobs, before automation takes the new jobs as well. This includes many job categories, such as in [[Autonomous car|transportation]], that were never threatened by automation before. According to a 2013 study, about 47% of US jobs are susceptible to automation.&lt;ref name="MyUser_FreyOsborneOxford"&gt;{{cite web

'''Yabla Inc.''' is an online [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) company featuring interactive videos of various difficulty levels and genres (including television dramas, music videos, animation, interviews, and grammar/vocabulary lessons). Yabla is currently available in Spanish, French, Italian, German, Mandarin Chinese, and English. Based in New York, NY, Yabla was incorporated in 2001 and began accepting subscribers to its French and Spanish sites in 2005.&lt;ref name=fltmag&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knowles|first1=Mark|title=Interview: John Duquette, CEO of Yabla|url=http://theforeignlanguagetechnologymagazine.com/yabla/|website=The Foreign Language Technology Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its customer base is mainly composed of native English speakers from the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.&lt;ref name=nytech&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keyson|first1=Lauren|title=Yabla|url=https://www.nytech.org/member-spotlight-details.php?mid=11|website=nytech.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yabla player ==
The interactive Yabla video player includes dual-language captions that can be independently displayed or hidden according to the user’s preference. Users can also click on a word in the captions to view its definition in an integrated dictionary tool and add it to a list of flashcards.&lt;ref name=languagemag&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guiney|first1=Pat|title=Keeping It Real|url=http://languagemagazine.com/internetedition/langmag_pages/june2009/KeepItReal_LM_June09.pdf|website=languagemagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yabla player also includes pitch-corrected slow play, which allows users to slow down the speech in each caption.&lt;ref name=nytech /&gt; A vocabulary review exercise and a [[Cloze test|cloze-based]] listening game provide further opportunities for user interaction.&lt;ref name=languagemag /&gt;

== Video content and sources ==
Yabla videos feature native speakers and the majority are licensed from third parties, such as [[Telefe]] in Argentina, [[RAI]] in Italy,&lt;ref name=fltmag /&gt; and RheinmainzTV in Germany,&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauer|first1=Ingrid|title=Yabla German Review|url=http://german.about.com/od/onlinelessons/fr/Yabla-German-Review.htm|website=german.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional videos produced by the company. All licensed material features authentic content, or content that is produced specifically for native speakers.&lt;ref name=iteslj&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilickaya|first1=Ferit|title=Authentic Materials and Cultural Content in EFL Classrooms|url=http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Kilickaya-AutenticMaterial|website=iteslj.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yabla’s interactive, multimodal features act as “mediators”&lt;ref name=languagemag /&gt; between the user and the native speakers in the videos, thus offering an [[Language immersion|immersive]] approach to language learning. The Yabla player was the first of its kind in the CALL field to offer mediated, user-controlled access to authentic content.&lt;ref name=fltmag /&gt;
