The '''adsorption/bio-oxidation process''' is a two-stage modification of the [[activated sludge]] process used for [[wastewater treatment]]. It consists of a high-loaded A-stage and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary [[clarifier]], with the A-stage being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.

==History==
[[Adsorption]]/bio-oxidation process was invented in the mid-1970s by the professor of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] Botho Böhnke. It was based on the finding, made by the German engineer [[Karl Imhoff]] in the 50th.{{Explain|date=March 2017}} Imhoff stated that the treatment efficiency of 60-80 percent could be achieved in highly loaded activated sludge basins.

In 1977 Böhnke published his first article on adsorption/bio-oxidation process.&lt;ref&gt;Böhnke B. (1977). Das Adsorptions-Belebungsverfahren. Korrespondenz Abwasser, 24. Jahrg., 2/77&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the patent was issued. Extensive research of the following years, conducted by prof. Böhnke together with Bernd and Andreas Diering, ended up in 1985 with the establishment of the company Dr.-Ing. Bernd Diering GmbH. The same year AB-process was for the first time applied in a full-scale at the [[Krefeld]], Germany [[sewage treatment]] plant (800 000 P.E.). In 1990, 19 full scale installations existed in Western Germany alone. Further application of the process in Europe was hindered by the tightening of the effluent discharge requirements with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. The process came into notice in 2000th again due to the increased interest in [[energy recovery]] from [[wastewater]].

==Principle of operation==
The A-stage, or [[adsorption]] stage is the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by [[primary treatment]]. [[File:AB process scheme.png|thumb|Simple schematic description of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process]] Influent organic matter is removed in the A-stage mainly by [[flocculation]] and [[sorption]] to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g [[Volatile suspended solids|VSS]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). [[Hydrolysis]] of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic [[biocoenosis]] with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the A-stage and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional [[activated sludge]] process.

The B-stage, or bio-oxidation stage, is a typical low-loaded activated sludge process, where [[biodegradation]] of the remaining organic material occurs. The B-stage can be designed for nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal by alternating aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones in the reactor.

===Typical operational conditions of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process===

===Advantages of the process===
* Lower aeration requirements decrease energy consumption and aeration costs for 20 percent if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c09/E4-11-06-03.pdf Technologies that Transform. Pollutants into Innocuous Components]. www.eolss.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* The volumes of [[Activated sludge#Process description|aeration tanks]] are 40% lower if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss/&gt;
* Increased sludge production in the A-stage results in increased [[biogas]] production in the [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] (for plants with [[anaerobic digestion]] of excess sludge).&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44&gt;[http://waterenenergie.stowa.nl/upload/publicaties/STOWA%202010-44%20European%20report%20100208%20-%20update.pdf Energy efficiency in the European water industry]. Stowa report #2010-44&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stability towards the shock loads (pH, [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), toxic substances) explained by the wide-ranging biochemical potential, high mutation capacity and adaptability of sludge in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2&gt;Boehnke, B., Diering, B., &amp; Zuckut, S. W. (1997). AB process removes organics and nutrients. Water Environment and Technology, 9(3), 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A-stage can receive higher organic loads than conventional activated sludge systems.
* Effluent concentrations are more stable because of the two-stage process configuration employed.
* Heavy metals are mainly removed with the A-stage sludge. Therefore, B-stage sludge has lower concentrations of heavy metals than sludge from conventional activated sludge process and may comply with the agricultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J.-L., Zhang, J.-T., Chen, X.,`Yi, H.-X. (2011). Characteristics of heavy-metal translating in adsorption and biodegradation activated sludge process. International Conference on Electric Technology and Civil Engineering, ICETCE 2011 - Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks of the process===
* Incomplete denitrification is often observed in the B-stage if the influent C/N ratio is low. Direct by-pass of a part of A-stage influent with high organic matter content to the B-stage is used to increase the C/N ratio.
* High sludge production in the A-stage is a drawback for WWTPs that are not equipped with anaerobic digestion of sludge, because it increases sludge treatment costs.
* Sludge from A-stage has poor settling properties.&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44/&gt;

==Nutrient removal==
Nitrogen removal in the A-stage can reach 30-40%, as nitrogen of organic compounds is incorporated in [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactor sludge.

The sludge age of the B-stage is typically between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of [[Nitrification|nitrifiers]]. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.&lt;ref name=wenyi&gt;Wenyi, D., Hong, D., Li-an, Z., Jia, M., Baozhen, W. (2006). Operational retrofits of AB process for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water Practice &amp; Technology, 1 (4) doi: 10.2166/WPT.2006078&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage.

Phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of the B-stage can be achieved by coagulation with ferric and aluminium salts, e.g. FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, J.-L., Shen, X., Peng, Z., Wang, Q. (2011). Study on the phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of AB process by ferric chloride. 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, ICBBE 2011 - Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Y.-Y., Luo, X.-X., Cheng, J.-H., Luo, G. (2008). Experimental investigation of chemically-enhanced phosphorus removal with adsorption-biodegradation process. Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for municipal wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process was applied at the Krefeld plant (800 000 P.E.) in 1985 for the first time. The plant was expanded and modified and currently treats municipal and industrial wastewater of 1 200 000 P.E.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt;

Currently adsorption/bio-oxidation process is applied at the municipal treatment plants in [[Germany]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] (WWTP Dokhaven (Rotterdam), WWTP Utrecht, WWTP Garmerwolde (Groningen) etc.), [[Austria]] (WWTP Salzburg, WWTP Strass etc.), [[Spain]], [[United States|USA]], [[China]] etc.&lt;ref name=stowa2&gt;[http://www.stowa.nl/Upload/Presentatie%20Marthe%20de%20Graaff%20%28Inventarisatie%20van%20AB-systemen%20in%20NL%29%20%282%29.pdf Inventarisatie van AB-systemen in NL]. www.stowa.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is a part of innovative wastewater treatment concept WaterSchoon, realized in the Netherlands. 250 apartments in the new district Noorderhoek ([[Sneek]], the Netherlands) are equipped with separate collection systems for toilet wastewater and the rest of the household wastewater (or so-called [[greywater]]). Both streams are treated separately in order to maximize recovery of resources from wastewater. Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for grey water treatment to increase sludge production. Sludge, produced in both stages of the process, is digested together with toilet wastewater in the UASB reactor to maximize energy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterschoon.nl/index.htm]. www.waterschoon.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for industrial wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for treatment of [[industrial wastewater]] with high COD, including wastewater from:
* [[Environmental impact of paper#Water pollution|Pulp and paper industry]]&lt;ref name=knudsen&gt;Knudsen, L., Pedersen, J. A., &amp; Munck, J. (1994). Advanced treatment of paper mill effluents by a two-stage activated sludge process. Water Science and Technology, 30 (3), 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Textile industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer&gt;Schulze-Rettmer, R., Kim, S. S., &amp; Son, S. S. (1992). Experience with two-stage activated sludge plants for industrial wastewaters in Korea. Water Science and Technology, 25 (4-5), 427-428.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|Food industry]], including dairy industry &lt;ref name=100years&gt;Jenkins, D. &amp; Wanner, J, (Eds.) (2014). Activated Sludge - 100 Years and Counting. IWA publishing {{ISBN|9781780404943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical industry]]&lt;ref name=100years/&gt;
* [[Tanning (leather)#Health and environmental impact|Leather tanning industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer/&gt;

The C/N and C/P ratios of industrial wastewater is often too high for complete aerobic [[biodegradation]] of the influent organic matter, even after the adsorption stage. Addition of nutrients prior to bio-oxidation stage is required in these cases.&lt;ref name=knudsen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9451">'''Agriculturalism''', also known as the '''School of Agrarianism''', the '''School of Agronomists''', the '''School of Tillers''', and in Chinese as the ''Nongjia'' (農家/农家), was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Chinese philosophy]] that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]], and was arguably the world's first [[Communist]] and [[Socialist]] movement that believed in a [[Classless society]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king [[Shennong]], a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as "working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached."&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society.

Agriculturalism was suppressed during the [[Qin Dynasty]] and most original texts are now lost.
However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; Agriculturalism has significantly influenced Chinese thought, and has been viewed as an essence of the Chinese identity.&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gladney |first=Dru|year=2004 | page= 300|title=Dislocating China|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
[[Image:Shennong3.jpg|thumb|To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler [[Shennong]] served as a model of the ideal government.]]
Agriculturalism dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]], during a period known as the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread.&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], all originated from this period.

Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister [[Hou Ji]], a figure known for his innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of [[Shennong]], the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

[[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A. C. Graham|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=42|number=1|year=1979|pages=66–100|jstor=614828|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00108468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] in 221 BC saw the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought]], including Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ong |first= Siew Chey|year=2005 | page= 16|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture |publisher=Marshall Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

The bibliography of the [[Book of Han]] (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural prospensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where "the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs.. the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

===Political===
To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of [[Shennong]]'s, is [[communalism|communal]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Said [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a prominent Agriculturalist:
{{quote|The ruler of Teng is an upright and worthy ruler. However, he has yet to hear the Way. A wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living. He governs while cooking his own meals. Now, that Teng has granaries and treasuries means that [the ruler] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself. How can he be a worthy ruler?|Xu Xing&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;}}

===Economic===
Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which "destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

==Reception==
Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the [[Mohist]] [[Mo Zi]], the Confucian [[Mencius]], and [[Yang Zhu]].&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; [[Mencius]] criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the [[division of labour]] central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a "Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue."&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
{{see also|Agrarianism}}
The Legalist [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purged rival philosophical schools]], including Agriculturalism, burning many Agriculturalist texts. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of [[Confucianism]], Legalism, and other philosophical schools,&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; so many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of [[Agrarianism]] in [[Europe]]. The French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, of [[François Quesnay]] and the [[Physiocrats]], are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="lam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maverick|first1= Lewis A.|year=1938|title= Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats|journal=Economic History|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agrostology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἄγρωστις|ἄγρωστις]]}}, ''agrōstis'', "type of grass"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''), sometimes '''graminology''', is the scientific study of the [[grass]]es (the family [[Poaceae]], or Gramineae). The grasslike species of the sedge family ([[Cyperaceae]]), the rush family ([[Juncaceae]]), and the bulrush or cattail family ([[Typha]]ceae) are often included with the true grasses in the category of [[graminoid]], although strictly speaking these are not included within the study of agrostology. In contrast to the word graminoid, the words '''gramineous''' and '''[[graminaceous]]''' are normally used to mean "of, or relating to, the true grasses ([[Poaceae]])".

Agrostology has importance in the maintenance of wild and grazed [[grassland]]s, [[agriculture]] (crop plants such as [[rice]], [[maize]], [[sugarcane]], and [[wheat]] are grasses, and many types of animal [[fodder]] are grasses), urban and environmental [[horticulture]], turfgrass management and [[sod]] production, [[ecology]], and [[conservation biology|conservation]].

Botanists that made important contributions to agrostology include:
* [[Jean Bosser]]
* [[Aimée Antoinette Camus]]
* [[Mary Agnes Chase]]
* [[Eduard Hackel]]
* [[Charles Edward Hubbard]]
* [[A. S. Hitchcock]]
* [[Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel]]

==History==

===German East Africa===
Also known as Amani Institute, the research institute was founded in 1902 by German colonists in [[German East Africa]] (''Deutsch-Ostafrika''). It was established under the leadership of Dr Frantz Stuhlmann, who was in charge of the Department of Surveying and Agriculture (est. 1893) of German East Africa.

The Amani Institute started out as a biological-agricultural research centre, and came to be known as the Amani Biological-Agricultural Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, W.O.; "German East Africa 1884 – 1918," in Vincent Harlow, E.M. Chilver, Alison Smith, eds., ''History of East Africa, II'', London: Oxford University Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #1: Henderson, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt; But it quickly expanded into other areas of research in the following years. "The Amani Institute soon became a 'tropical scientific institute superior to anything in the British colonies and protectorates and comparable with Pusa in India or the Dutch establishment at Buitenzorg in Java." &lt;ref&gt;Report of the East Africa Commission'', Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #2: Henderson, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their reign, the Germans had other research centres in the colony, especially in the northern region. "Although Amani was the most famous of Germany's colonial research stations, representing a 2-million-mark investment, it was only one of several German agricultural stations in the northern region. Another, named Kwai farm and located in the nearby West Usambaras, preceded Amani as the colony's chief center for agricultural and livestock experiments. Kwai lacked Amani's international reputation, but it nonetheless held a prominent place in the minds of the Africans who lived in its shadow." &lt;ref&gt;Conte, Christopher-Allan; "Imperial Science, Tropical Ecology, and Indigenous History: Tropical Research Stations in Northeastern German East Africa, 1896 to Present," in Gregory Blue, Martin Bunton and Ralph Croizier, eds., ''Colonialism and the Modern World: Selected Studies'', New York: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conte, Christopher-Allan; ''Highland Sanctuary: Environmental History in Tanzania's Usambara Mountains'', Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #3: Conte, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;246 – 247; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans built other facilities, including schools and hospitals, in different parts of the country while ruling the colony (1891–1918). One of their biggest colonial achievements was in scientific research at the institutes they established in German East Africa, especially at Amani.

===British Tanganyika===
The German East Africa colony was renamed [[Tanganyika Territory]] in 1920 when the British took over, by a [[League of Nations]] Mandate, after the [[German Empire]] lost World War I. Other areas of research were added to the institute in 1960.

Although the Amani Research Institute became world-famous during German colonial rule as a scientific research centre,&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;246; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; it retained its international reputation after the British received control of the colony they renamed [[Tanganyika]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]] ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'';  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;164: "The Amani Research Institute....was established by the German colonial rulers and became world-famous as a tropical research institute."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
In 1964, liberated [[Tanganyika]] united with [[Zanzibar]] to form the independent nation of [[Tanzania]]. After British colonial rule ended, the institute continued to play an important role as a research centre in Tanzania.

In 1977, it was renamed Amani Medical Research Centre of the National Institute for Medical Research, covering a wide range of areas in medical research.

==Achievements==
During [[World War I]], the Amani Research Institute reinforced its international reputation in research when scientists at the centre developed various products. They included medicine and chemical products, from local material to meet war needs and those of the German settlers at a time when the colony was cut off from the rest of the world and could not import anything:

"Considerable ingenuity was shown in producing in the colony manufactured goods and medical supplies normally imported from Europe. Quinine was made at the Amani Institute and at [[Mpwapwa]]....Dye-stuffs were made from native barks. In the first eighteen months of the war the Amani Agricultural Research Institute 'prepared for use from its own products 16 varieties of foodstuffs and liquors, 11 varieties of spices, 12 varieties of medicines and medicaments, 5 varieties of rubber products, 2 of soap, oils and candles, 3 of materials used in making boats, and 10 miscellaneous substances. Many of these were prepared in comparatively large quantities, e.g.15,200 bottles of whisky and other alcoholic liquors, 10,252 lb. of chocolate and cocoa, 2,652 parcels of toothpowder, 10,000 pieces of soap, 300 bottles of castor oil etc.' &lt;ref&gt;''Report of the East Africa Commission'', Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86....Owing to the blockade, overseas trade came to an end....The long drawn-out conflict inflicted serious damage on the colony."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.O. Henderson, "The war economy of German East Africa, 1914 - 1917," ''Economic History Review'', xiii, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #5: Henderson, 1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;160 – 161; Henderson, 1943, pp.&amp;nbsp;104 – 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British took over, they were "impressed both with Amani's international reputation and the quality of research conducted there...and continued operating it as a research institute under the British postwar government. Amani therefore continued to function as an important center of botanical research and became a flash point for arguments over the value of pure versus applied research in Britain's East African colonies." &lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;246; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also became famous for its research in malaria during British colonial rule and was transformed in 1949 into the East African Malaria Unit. The research centre served not only Tanganyika but also [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[British Somaliland]] in the prevention and control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. It became the East African Malaria Institute in 1951 and was renamed the East African Institute of Malaria and Vector Borne Diseases in 1954.

In the present day it maintains a high reputation in research, as the Amani Medical Research Centre, in the [[Tanga Region]] of Tanzania.

{{Ancient Egyptian culture}}
'''Ancient Egyptian architecture''' is the architecture of one of the most influential civilizations throughout history, which developed a vast array of diverse structures and great architectural monuments along the [[Nile]], including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] and [[Egyptian temple|temples]].

==Characteristics==
Due to the scarcity of wood,&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Blakemore, ''History of Interior Design and Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe'', John Wiley and Sons 1996, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked [[mud brick]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Old Kingdom]] onward, stone was generally reserved for [[tomb]]s and [[Egyptian temple|temples]], while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the [[pyramid]]s consisted of locally quarried stone, mudbricks, sand or gravel. For the casing stones were used that had to be transported from farther away, predominantly white limestone from Tura and red granite from upper Egypt.

[[File:Lepsius-Projekt tw 1-2-108.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Drawings of the types of the architectural [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] specific for the Ancient Egyptian civilization.]]

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the damp banks of the Nile river. It was placed in moulds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction. If the bricks were intended to be used in a royal tomb like a  pyramid, the exterior bricks would also be finely chiselled and polished.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. However, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village [[Deir al-Madinah]], the Middle Kingdom town at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]],&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara'', Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, and Co., London 1890&lt;/ref&gt; and the fortresses at [[Buhen]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gates, ''Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome'', Routledge 2003, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirgissa]]. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Byron Esely Shafer ''Temples of Ancient Egypt'', I.B.Tauris, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the [[arch]] was developed during the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]], all monumental buildings are [[post and lintel]] constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the [[column]]s and [[pier (architecture)|piers]], were covered with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, pp.107ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are [[symbol]]ic, such as the [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab]], or sacred beetle, the [[solar disk]], and the [[vulture]]. Other common motifs include [[palm tree|palm]] leaves, the [[papyrus]] plant, and the buds and flowers of the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2005, pp.204ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphs]] were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years.

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the [[Pharaoh]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Temples aligned with the stars", ''New Scientist'' 2724 (5 Sep. 2009), p. 7; see also J. Belmonte &amp; M. Shaltout, "Keeping Ma’at: an astronomical approach to the orientation of the temples in ancient Egypt", ''Advances in Space Research'' (August 2009) {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2009.03.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giza pyramid complex==
{{Main|Giza pyramid complex}}
The Giza Necropolis stands on the [[Giza Plateau]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. This complex of ancient monuments is located some 8 kilometers (5&amp;nbsp;mi) inland into the desert from the old town of [[Giza]] on the Nile, some 20 kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Cairo city center. This [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] consists of the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] (also known as the ''[[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]'' and the ''Pyramid of Cheops''), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Kephren/Chefren), and the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or Mykerinus/Mycerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, the [[Great Sphinx]] as well as a few hundred mastabas, and chapels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winston|first=Alan|title=An overview of the Giza Plateau in Egypt|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/giza.htm|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pyramids of Giza]]
The pyramids, which were built in the Fourth Dynasty, testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. They were built to serve both as grave sites and also as a way to make their names last forever.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S.

It is not as tall as his father's pyramid but he was able to give it the impression of appearing taller by building it on a site with a foundation 33 feet (10 m) higher than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehner|first=Mark|title=The Pyramid of Khafre|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm|work=The Complete Pyramids|accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728213057/http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm| archivedate= 28 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with building his pyramid, Chefren commissioned the building of the giant Sphinx as guardian over his tomb. The face of a human, possibly a depiction of the pharaoh, on a lion's body was seen as a symbol of [[divinity]] among the Greeks fifteen hundred years later.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; The Great Sphinx is carved out of the limestone bedrock and stands about 65 feet (20 m) tall.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; Menkaure's pyramid dates to circa 2490 BC and stands 213 feet (65 m) high making it the smallest of the Great Pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyramid of Mankaure|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/menkaure.html|work=National Geographic: Egypt|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=26 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002191314/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/menkaure.html|archive-date=2 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular culture leads people to believe that Pyramids are highly confusing, with many tunnels within the pyramid to create confusion for grave robbers. This is not true. The shafts of pyramids are quite simple, mostly leading directly to the tomb. The immense size of the pyramids attracted robbers to the wealth that lay inside which caused the tombs to be robbed relatively soon after the tomb was sealed in some cases.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; There are sometimes additional tunnels, but these were used for the builders to understand how far they could dig the tomb into the crust of the Earth. Also, it is popularly thought that due to grave robbers, future Kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings to help keep them hidden. This is also false, as the Pyramid construction continued for many Dynasties, just on a smaller scale. Finally, the pyramid construction was stopped due to economic factors, not theft.

Evidence suggests that they were built by paid laborers and craftsmen that were well cared for and not by slaves.

==New Kingdom Temples==

=== Luxor Temple ===
{{Main|Luxor Temple}}
The Luxor Temple is a huge ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the [[Nile|River Nile]] in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]). Construction work on the temple began during the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] in the 14th century BC. [[Horemheb]] and [[Tutankhamun]] added columns, statues, and friezes&amp;nbsp;– and [[Akhenaten]] had earlier obliterated his father's [[cartouche]]s and installed a shrine to the [[Aten]]&amp;nbsp;– but the only major expansion effort took place under [[Ramesses II]] some 100 years after the first stones were put in place. Luxor is thus unique among the main Egyptian temple complexes in having only two pharaohs leave their mark on its architectural structure.

[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.06.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Luxor Temple, from the east bank of the Nile]]
The temple proper begins with the {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} high First [[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]], built by Ramesses II. The pylon was decorated with scenes of Ramesses's military triumphs (particularly the [[Battle of Qadesh]]); later pharaohs, particularly those of the [[Nubia]]n and [[Ethiopia]]n dynasties, also recorded their victories there. This main entrance to the temple complex was originally flanked by six colossal statues of Ramesses&amp;nbsp;– four seated, and two standing&amp;nbsp;– but only two (both seated) have survived. Modern visitors can also see a {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} tall pink granite [[obelisk]]: this one of a matching pair until 1835, when the other one was taken to [[Paris]] where it now stands in the centre of the [[Place de la Concorde]].

Through the pylon gateway leads into a [[peristyle]] courtyard, also built by Ramesses II. This area, and the pylon, were built at an oblique angle to the rest of the temple, presumably to accommodate the three pre-existing barque shrines located in the northwest corner. After the peristyle courtyard comes the processional colonnade built by Amenhotep III&amp;nbsp;– a {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} corridor lined by 14 [[papyrus]]-[[capital (architecture)|capital]] columns. Friezes on the wall describe the stages in the Opet Festival, from sacrifices at Karnak at the top left, through [[Amun]]'s arrival at Luxor at the end of that wall, and concluding with his return on the opposite side. The decorations were put in place by Tutankhamun: the boy pharaoh is depicted, but his names have been replaced with those of Horemheb.

Beyond the colonnade is a peristyle courtyard, which also dates back to Amenhotep's original construction. The best preserved columns are on the eastern side, where some traces of original color can be seen. The southern side of this courtyard is made up of a 36-column [[hypostyle]] court (i.e., a roofed space supported by columns) that leads into the dark inner rooms of the temple.

=== Temple of Karnak ===
{{Main|Karnak}}
[[File:KarnakVisitorCenterModel.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the temple complex at Karnak visiting center.]]
The temple complex of Karnak is located on the banks of the Nile River some 2.5 kilometers (1.5&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Luxor]]. It consists of four main parts, the [[Precinct of Amon-Re]], the [[Precinct of Montu]], the [[Precinct of Mut]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] (dismantled), as well as a few smaller temples and sanctuaries located outside the enclosing walls of the four main parts, and several avenues of ram-headed sphinxes connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amon-Re and Luxor Temple. This temple complex is particularly significant, for many rulers have added to it. However, notably every ruler of the New Kingdom added to it. The site covers over 200 acres and consists of a series of pylons, leading into courtyards, halls, chapels, obelisks, and smaller temples. The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction work began in the 16th century BC, and was originally quite modest in size. But eventually, in the main precinct alone, as many as twenty temples and chapels would be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=R.|publisher=New York, Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of those features is overwhelming.[[File:Luxor Karnak-Tempel 2016-03-21 Große Säulenhalle 04.jpg|thumb|Example of the inscriptions present throughout the complex. As visible from this image, the upper regions are painted, suggesting (in cannon with other such temples) that the remain  columns and ceilings would have been brightly painted. The temple roof representing the heavens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture, Astronomy and Sacred Landscape in Ancient Egypt|last=Gulio|first=Magli|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; would often display images of stars and birds, whereas the columns often boast images of palm plants, lotus and people.]]One of the greatest temples in Egyptian history is that of Amun-Ra at Karnak. As with many other temples in Egypt, this one details the feats of the past (including thousands of years of history detailed via inscriptions on many of the walls and columns found on site, often modified or completely erased and redone by following rulers), and honors the gods. The temple of Amun-Re was constructed in three sections, the third being constructed by the later New Kingdom pharaohs. In cannon with the traditional style of Egyptian architecture, many of the architectural features, such as the inner sanctum of the complex, were aligned with the sunset of the summer solstice.

One of the architectural features present at the site is the 5,000 sq m (50,000 sq ft) hypostyle hall built during the Ramesside period. The hall is supported by approximately 139 sandstone and mud brick columns, with 12 central columns (~69 feet tall) that would have all been brightly painted.

=== Temple Ramesseum ===
[[File:Egypt.Ramesseum.02.jpg|thumb|The design of Ramesses's mortuary temple adheres to the standard style of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple entrance consists of a number of stone figures, one located horizontally to the next. In the center area of the complex was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary.]]
Ramses II, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh ruled Egypt from around 1279 to 1213 BCE. Among Ramses II many accomplishments, such as the expanding of the Egyptian borders, he constructed a massive temple called the Ramesseum. The temple is located near the city of Thebes, which at the time was the capital for the New kingdom pharaoh. The Ramesseum was a magnificent temple, completed with monument status to guard its entrance; the most impressive of which was a 62 foot tall statue of Ramses himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The encyclopaedia of ancient Egyptian architecture|last=Dieter|first=Arnold|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-465-1|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments of this structure remain, particularly its base and torso are all that remain of the this impressive statue of the enthroned pharaoh, and thus the dimensions and weight (approximately 1000 pounds) are based on estimates. The temple was also accompanied with impressive reliefs many of which detail a number of Rames' military victories, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]] (ca. 1274 BC) and the pillaging of the city "Shalem".

=== Temple of Malkata ===
Under the tenure of Amenhotep III workers constructed over 250 buildings and monuments. One of the most impressive building projects was the temple complex of Malkata, known among the ancient Egyptians as the “house of rejoicing”, was constructed to serve his royal residence on the west bank of Thebes, just south of the Theban necropolis. The site is approximately 226,000 square meters (or 2,432,643 square feet).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koltsida|first=Aikaterini|date=2007|title=A Dark Spot in Ancient Egyptian Architecture: The Temple of Malkata|url=|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|volume=43|pages=43–57|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the immense size of the site, along with its many buildings, courts, parade grounds, and housing, it is considered to have served not just as a temple and dwelling of the Pharaoh but a town.

The central area of the complex consisted in the Pharaoh's apartments that were made up of a number of rooms and courts, all of which were oriented around a columned banquet hall. Accompanying the apartments, that presumably housed the royal cohort and foreign guests, was a large throne room connected to smaller chambers, for storage, waiting, and smaller audiences. The greater elements of this area of the complex are what have been come to be called the West Villas (just west of the King's Palace), the North Palace and Village, and Temple.
[[File:Reconstruction of Wall Decoration from the Temple of Amun at Malqata MET 17.10.1a.jpg|thumb|The faience (glazed ceramic earthenware) tile (above) is a reconstruction of wall decoration fragments found at the Temple of Malkata in stacks at the southwest corner.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551605|title=Reconstruction of Geometric Decoration|last=|first=|date=|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold spirals here were painted with gold paint, whereas the originals would have probably been covered by gold foil. Notably, similar patterns are found in the Pharaoh's Palace.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;]]
The temple's external dimensions are approximately 183.5 by 110.5 m, and consists of two parts: the large forecourt and the temple proper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The large front court is 131.5 by 105.5 m, oriented on the east-west axis, and occupies the east part of the temple complex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western part of the court is on a higher level and is divided from the rest of the court by a low retaining wall. The lower court is almost square, whereas the upper terrace was rectangular in shape. The upper section of the court was paved with mud bricks and has a 4 m wide entrance to it from the lower part of the fore-court, connecting the base to the upper landing was a ramp enclosed by walls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This ramp and entrance were both at the center of the temple, with the same orientation as the front court entrance and the temple proper.

The temple proper might be seen as divided in to three distinct parts: central, north, and south. The central part is indicated by a small rectangular anteroom (6.5 by 3.5 m), many of the door jambs including those of the antechamber include inscriptions, such as 'given life like Ra forever'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 12.5 by 14.5 m hall follows the anteroom from which is entered via a 3.5 m wide door in the center of the front wall of the hall. There is evidence the ceiling of this chamber was decorated with yellow stars on blue background, whereas the walls today show only the appearance of a white stucco over mud plaster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notwithstanding, we might speculate given the numerous decorative plaster fragments found within the room's deposit that these too were ornately decorated with various images and patterns. Supporting the ceiling are six columns arranged in two rows with east-west axis. Only small fragments of the column bases have survived, though they suggest the diameter of these columns to have been about 2.25 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The columns are placed 2.5 m away from the walls and in each row the columns are approximately 1.4 m away from the next, while the space between the two rows is 3 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second hall (12.5 by 10 m&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) is accessed by a 3 m door at the center of the back wall of the first. The second hall is similar to the first, first its ceiling seems to have been decorated with similar if not identical patterns and images as the first. Second, in the same way the ceiling is supported by columns, four to be precise, ordered in two rows on the same axis as those of the first hall, with a 3 m wide space between them. In hall two, at-least one of the rooms appears to have been dedicated to the cult of Maat, which suggests the other three in this area might have likewise served such a religious purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The southern part of the temple may be divided into two sections: western and southern. The western section consists of 6 rooms, whereas the southern area given its size (19.5 by 17.2 m) suggests it might have served as another open court. In many of these rooms were found blue ceramic tiles inlaid with gold around their edge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Northern part of the temple proper consists of ten rooms, similar in style to those of the southern.

The temple itself seems to have been dedicated to the Egyptian deity Amun, given the number of bricks stamped with various inscriptions, such as "the temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing" or "Nebmaarta in the Temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing". Overall the temple of Malakata shares many with other cult temples of the New Kingdom, with magnificent halls and religiously oriented rooms with many others more closely resemble store rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansing|first=Ambrose|date=1918|title=Excavations at the Palace of Amenhotep III at Thebes|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=13|pages=|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Egyptian Fortresses ==
Fortifications within Ancient Egypt were built in times of conflict between rival principalities.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;Lawrence, A. (1965). Ancient Egyptian Fortifications. ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,51''(1), 69-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all fortresses analyzed within this time frame, most (if not all) were built of the same materials. The only exception to the rule were some fortresses from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] as fortresses such as the fort of [[Buhen]] utilized stone with the creation of its walls. The main walls were mainly built with mud brick but were reinforced with other materials such as timber. Rocks were also utilized to not only preserve them from erosion as well as paving.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;  Secondary walls would be built outside of fortresses main walls and were relatively close to one another. As a result, this would prove to be a challenge to invaders were as they forced to destroy this fortification before they could reach the main walls of the fort.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Clarke, S. (1916). ANCIENT EGYPTIAN FRONTIER FORTRESSES. ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,'' ''3'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Another strategy was utilized if the enemy managed to break through the first barrier. Upon making it to the main wall, a ditch would be constructed that would be positioned between the secondary and first walls. The purpose of this was to place the enemy in a position that would leave them exposed to the enemy, making the invaders susceptible to arrow fire.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The position of this ditch Walls within the interior of fortresses would become demilitarized during times of unity; leading to them being demolished. The parts that were used to construct said walls could then be reused, making the overall design extremely beneficial.

Fortresses within Ancient Egypt held multiple functions. During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] Period, the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] would establish means of control throughout the Nubian Riverside by creating fortified stations.  The location of Egyptian fortresses were not exclusive to just the riverside. Sites within both Egypt and Nubia would be placed on terrain that was either rocky or sandy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The purpose behind this method was to spread its influence throughout the region as well as discourage rival groups from raiding the sites.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Inspections of these forts in Nubia have led to the discovery of copper smelting materials which suggest a relationship between miners in the region &lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; The occupation of these Nubian forts suggests a trade relationship between the two parties. Miners would collect the materials and would transfer them to these forts in exchange for food and water. Up until the Thirteenth dynasty, Egypt would hold control of Nubia through the use of these fortresses.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

=== Pelusium Fortress ===

The Pelusium fortress served as means of protection from invaders coming towards the Nile Delta.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Stanley, Jean-Daniel, et al. “Pelusium, an Ancient Port Fortress on Egypt's Nile Delta Coast: Its Evolving Environmental Setting from Foundation to Demise.” ''Journal of Coastal Research'', vol. 24, no. 2, 2008, pp. 451–462. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30137849.&lt;/ref&gt; While the site served this role for more than a millennium, Pelusium was also known for being a center of trade (both land and Maritime). Trade was primarily conducted between Egypt and the Levant.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While information is not concrete in terms of the fortresses establishment, it is suggested that Pelusium was erected during either the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period or during the Saite and Persian periods from the 16th and 18th century.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Pelusium is also seen as an integral part of the Nile as other ruins were found outside its borders, indicating that the area was large in occupation. Architecturally, structures of Pelusium (such as it's gates and towers) appear to be built from limestone. A metallurgy industry is also indicated to have taken place at this site due to the discovery of copper-ore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Excavations of the site have also discovered older materials that date back some of the early dynasties. The found materials include Basalt, Granite, Diorite, Marble, and Quartzite.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; How these materials were utilized during the operation of is unclear as they may have been placed at the location more recently.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Seeing as the fortress was placed in close proximity to the [[Nile|Nile River]], the fort was largely surrounded by both dunes and coastal lines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

There are multiple reasons that caused the decline of the Pelusium fortress. During its existence, events such as the Bubonic Plague appeared in the Mediterranean for the first time and multiple fires within the fortress occurred&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  Conquest from the Persians as well as a decrease in trade could also be attributed to the increase also may have lead to an increase in abandonment. Officially, natural reasons are what led to Pelusium falling apart such as tectonic motions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  The official desertion of the site is attributed to the time of the crusades.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Fortress of Jaffa ===
Jaffa Fortress was prominent during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period of Egypt. It served as both a fortress and a port on the Mediterranean coast. To this day, Jaffa serves as a primary Egyptian port.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Aaron A. Burke, et al. “Excavations of the New Kingdom Fortress in Jaffa, 2011–2014: Traces of Resistance to Egyptian Rule in Canaan.” ''American Journal of Archaeology'', vol. 121, no. 1, 2017, pp. 85–133. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.121.1.0085.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally under the control of the Canaanites, the site fell under the control of the Egyptian Empire. Because of a lack of evidence, it is unclear as to what exactly caused the succession from Canaanite to Egyptian occupation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; During the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], the site was successfully in holding campaigns from Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In terms of its functions, the site held multiple roles. It is suggested that Jaffa's primary function was to serve as a granary for the Egyptian Army.

Rameses gate, which is dated to the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], serves as a connection to the fortress. Ramparts were also discovered with the fortress Upon excavation, the site hosted multiple items such as bowls, imported jars, pot stands, and beer and bread which further emphasizes the importance of these items to the area.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The discovery of these objects show a close connection between the storing of food and the creation of ceramic items.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Mastaba ==
Mastabas are burial tombs that hold royal significance. As chosen by Egyptian rulers, many of the tombs found throughout time were located along the Nile river.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;L. E. R. “Two Mastaba Chambers.” ''Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin'', vol. 8, no. 45, 1910, pp. 19–20. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4423469.&lt;/ref&gt; The structural exterior regarding Mastabas varies throughout history but there is a noticeable evolution of the course of Egyptian dynasties. The Mastabas of the First Egyptian Dynasty would be created through the use of stepped bricks.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;Badawy, Alexander. “The Ideology of the Superstructure of the Mastaba-Tomb in Egypt.” ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', vol. 15, no. 3, 1956, pp. 180–183. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/542310.&lt;/ref&gt; The design would then evolve by the time of the Fourth Dynasty as the structural exterior change from brick to stone.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The reasoning behind the stepped designs of Mastabas is connected to the idea of "accession".&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Lateral penetration was a concern in when constructing tombs. In order to prevent damage to the structure, brickwork layers were placed around the base of structure.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Mastabas from the old empire, took upon a pyramid design structure.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This design was largely reserved for rulers, such as the king, and his family as a means for burial.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Other design characteristics regarding Mastabas from the old empire include having rectangular outlines, walls that were slanted which were made of stone and brick materials, and having the axis of a building run both North and South.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Multiple elements make up the interior of Mastabas such as an offering chamber, statues for the dead, and a vault beneath which held sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By the end of the old Empire, the usage of these tombs were abandoned.[[File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|thumb|The Pyramid of Ahmose illustrates the decrease in structural design quality of New Kingdom Egypt.]]

'''Campanology''' (from [[Late Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:campana|campana]]'', "bell"; and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the study of [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. It encompasses the technology of bells – how they are [[casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[musical tuning|tuned]], rung, and sounded – as well as the history, methods, and traditions of bell-ringing as an art.&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; "Campanology - Study of the history, art and science of making and ringing bells.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to collect together a set of tuned bells and treat the whole as one [[musical instrument]]. Such collections – such as a Flemish carillon, a Russian ''zvon'', or an English "[[ring of bells]]" used for [[change ringing]] – have their own practices and challenges; and campanology is likewise the study of perfecting such instruments and  composing and performing music for them.

In this sense, however, the word ''campanology'' is most often used in reference to relatively large bells, often hung in a tower. It is not usually applied to assemblages of smaller bells, such as a [[glockenspiel]], a collection of [[tubular bell]]s, or an Indonesian [[gamelan]].

A campanologist is one who studies campanology, though it is popularly mis-used to refer to a [[bell ringer]].&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; " Campanologist - One who studies campanology, (popularly mis-used to refer to a ringer).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carillons==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Carillon]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Carillon}}

[[File:Carillon of PeterAndPaulCathedral 1.JPG|thumb|Carillon - showing the large number of tuned bells normally used]]

The carillon is a collection of tuned bells for playing conventional melodic music. The bells are stationary and struck by hammers linked to a clavier keyboard.
[[File:JeffDaehn.jpg|thumb|Carillonneur in action]]
The instrument is played sitting on a bench by hitting the top keyboard that allows expression through variation of touch, with the underside of the half-clenched fists, and the bottom keyboard with the feet, since the lower notes in particular require more physical strength than an organ, the latter not attaining the tonal range of the better carillons: for some of these, their bell producing the lowest tone, the 'bourdon', may weigh well over 8 [[tonne]]s; other fine bells settle for 5 to 6 tonnes. A carillon renders at least two octaves for which it needs 23 bells, though the finest have 47 to 56 bells or extravagantly even more, arranged in [[chromatic]] sequence, so tuned as to produce concordant harmony when many bells are sounded together.

Professional Carillonneurs like Belgian [[Jef Denyn]] have widespread fame&lt;ref name="Discography of Jef Denyn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jef Denyn Discography at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jef+Denyn|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest are found in church towers in continental northern Europe, especially in cathedral towers in Belgium and present-day northern France, where some (like the [[St. Rumbolds Cathedral]] in [[Mechelen]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp]]) became [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] &amp;ndash; classified with the Belfry of Bruges and its municipal Carillon under '[[Belfries of Belgium and France]]'.&lt;br&gt;The carillon of [[Kirk in the Hills]], [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], [[United States]], along with the one at Hyechon College in [[Daejeon|Daejoen, South Korea]], have the highest number of bells in the world: 77.&lt;br&gt;Modern large carillon edifices have been erected as stand-alone instruments across the world, for instance the [[Netherlands Carillon]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].
The carillon in the Church of St Peter, [[Aberdyfi]], Gwynedd, Wales is often used to play the famous '[[The Bells of Aberdovey (song)|Bells of Aberdovey]]' tune.

==Chimes==
{{Main article|Chime (bell instrument)}}
A carillon-like instrument with fewer than 23 bells is called a ''chime''. American chimes usually have one to one and a half [[diatonic]] octaves. Many chimes play an automated piece of music, such as [[clock chimes]]. Chime bells generally used to lack dynamic variation and [[inner tuning]], or the mathematical balance of a bell's complex sound, to permit use of harmony. Since the 20th century, in Belgium and The Netherlands, clock chime bells have inner tuning and produce complex fully harmonized music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html Bell Facts &amp;ndash; Bell Chimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813004017/http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html |date=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These chimes should not be confused with another musical instrument also called ''chimes'' (or ''[[tubular bell]]s'') nor with a ''[[wind chime]]''.

==Russian Orthodox bells==
{{Main article|Russian Orthodox bell ringing}}
[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian chiming on a portable belfry]]
The bells in Russian tradition are sounded by their clappers, attached to ropes; a special system of ropes is developed individually for every belltower. All the ropes are gathered in one place, where the bell-ringer stands. The ropes (usually all ropes) are not pulled, but rather pressed with hands or legs. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper move.

The Russian [[Tsar Bell]] is the largest extant bell in the world.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Full circle change ringing==
{{Main article|Change ringing}}
[[File:Bells.devon.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Change ringing in a church in [[Devon]], England]]
[[File:St Bees bells in up position.jpg|thumb|The bells of [[St Bees Priory]], England shown in the "up" position. When being rung they swing through a full circle from mouth upwards round to mouth upwards, and then back again.]]

In English style (see below) [[full circle ringing]] the bells in a church tower are hung so that on each stroke the bell swings through a complete circle; actually a little more than 360 degrees. Between strokes, it briefly sits poised 'upside-down', with the mouth pointed upwards; pulling on a rope connected to a large diameter wheel attached to the bell swings it down and the assembly's own momentum propels the bell back up again on the other side of the swing. Each alternate pull or stroke is identified as either ''handstroke'' or ''backstroke'' - handstroke where the "sally" (the fluffy area covered with wool) is pulled followed by a pull on the plain "tail". At [[East Bergholt]] in the English county of [[Suffolk]], there is a unique set of bells that are not in a tower and are rung full circle by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = East Bergholt and Constable Country: The Bell Cage | url = http://www.eastbergholt-bells.org.uk/ | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the heaviest ring of five bells listed in [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a tenor of {{long ton||26|0|8}} and a combined weight of {{long ton|4|5|2|24}}

These [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] have relatively few bells, compared with a carillon; six or eight-bell towers are common, with the largest rings in numbering up to sixteen bells. The bells are usually tuned to fall in a [[diatonic scale]] without [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] notes; they are traditionally numbered from the top downwards so that the highest bell (called the ''treble'') is numbered 1 and the lowest bell (the ''tenor'') has the highest number; it is usually the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] note of the bells' scale.

To swing the heavy bells requires a ringer for each bell. Furthermore, the great [[inertia]]s involved mean that a ringer has only a limited ability to retard or accelerate his/her bell's cycle. Along with the relatively limited palette of notes available, the upshot is that such rings of bells do not easily lend themselves to ringing [[melody|melodies]].

[[File:Plain-bob-minor 2.png|180px|right|thumb|This is a diagram of one type of method ringing. Each bell strikes once in every sequence, or change, and repetition is avoided. Here 1 is the highest-pitched, and 6 is the lowest]] 
Instead, a system of ''change ringing'' evolved, probably early in the seventeenth century, which centres on [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[permutations]]. The ringers begin with ''rounds'', which is simply ringing down the scale in numerical order. (On six bells this would be ''123456''.) The ringing then proceeds in a series of ''rows'' or ''changes'', each of which is some permutation of rounds  (for example ''214365'') where no bell changes by more than one position from the preceding row (this is also known as the [[Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm]]).

In ''call change ringing'', one of the ringers (known as the ''Conductor'') calls out to tell the other ringers how to vary their order. The timing of the calls and changes of pattern accompanying them are made at the discretion of the Conductor and so do not necessarily involve a change of ringing sequence at each successive stroke as is characteristic of ''method ringing''. Some ringers, notably in the West of England where there is a strong call-change tradition, ring call changes exclusively but for others, the essence of change ringing is the substantially different method ringing. As of 2015 there are 7,140 English style rings.  The Netherlands, Pakistan, India, and Spain have one each.  The Windward Isles and the Isle of Man have 2 each.  Canada and New Zealand 8 each.  The Channel Isles 10.  Africa as a continent has 13.  Scotland 24, Ireland 37, USA 48, Australia 59 and Wales 227.  The remaining 6,798 (95.2%) are in England (including three mobile rings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = County Lists from Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | accessdate = 12 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''method'' or ''scientific ringing'' each ringer has memorized a pattern describing his or her bell's course from row to row; taken together, these patterns (along with only occasional ''calls'' made by a conductor) form an [[algorithm]] which cycles through the various available permutations dictated by the number of bells available. There are hundreds of these methods which have been composed over the centuries and all have names, some being very fanciful. Better-known examples such as Plain Bob, Reverse Canterbury, Grandsire and Double Oxford are familiar to most ringers.

Serious ringing always starts and ends with rounds; and it must always be ''true'' — each row must be unique, never repeated. A performance of a few hundred rows or so is called a ''touch''.  A performance of all the possible permutations possible on a set of bells is called an ''extent'', with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bells there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;[[factorial|!]] possible permutations.  With five bells 5! = 120 which takes about 5 minutes.  With seven bells 7! = 5,040 which takes about three hours to ring.  This is the definition of a full peal on 7 (5,000 or more for other numbers of bells.)  Less demanding is the quarter peal of 1,260 changes.  When ringing peals and quarter peals on fewer bells several complete extents are rung consecutively.  When ringing on higher numbers of bells less than a complete extent is rung.  On eight bells the extent is 8!=40,320 which has only been accomplished once, taking nearly nineteen hours.

Ringing in English belltowers became a popular hobby in the late 17th century, in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era; the scientific approach which led to modern method ringing can be traced to two books of that era, ''Tintinnalogia or the Art of Ringing'' (published in 1668 by Richard Duckworth and [[Fabian Stedman]]) and ''Campanalogia'' (also by Stedman; first released 1677; see [[Campanology#Bibliography|Bibliography]]). Today change ringing remains most popular in England but is practiced worldwide; over four thousand peals are rung each year.

[[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s mystery story, ''[[The Nine Tailors]]'' (1934) centres around change ringing of bells in a [[The Fens|Fenland]] church; her father was a clergyman.

==Ellacombe apparatus==
{{Main article|Ellacombe apparatus}}
[[File:Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells.jpg|right|thumb|Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells]]
The '''Ellacombe apparatus''' is an English mechanism devised for chiming by striking stationary bells with external hammers. However it does not have the same sound as [[full circle ringing]] due to the absence of the doppler effect derived from bell rotation and the lack of a damping effect of the clapper after each strike.

It requires only one person to operate. Each hammer is connected by a rope to a fixed frame in the bell-ringing room. When in use the ropes are taut, and pulling one of the ropes towards the player will strike the hammer against the bell. To enable normal full circle ringing on the same bells, the ropes are slackened to allow the hammers to drop away from the moving bells.

The system was devised by Reverend [[Henry Thomas Ellacombe]] of Gloucestershire, who first had such a system installed in [[Bitton]] in 1821. He created the system to make conventional bell-ringers redundant, so churches did not have to tolerate the behaviour of what he thought were unruly bell-ringers.

However, in reality, it required very rare expertise for one person to ring changes. The sound of a chime was a poor substitute for the rich sound of swinging bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently, the Ellacombe apparatus has been disconnected or removed from many towers in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In towers where the apparatus remains intact, it is generally used like a [[Carillon]], but to play  simple tunes, or if expertise exists, to play changes.

==Gamelan==
{{Main article|Gamelan}}
Perhaps the best-known example from outside Europe of an organized system of bells is the [[gamelan]], an [[Indonesia]]n orchestra-like ensemble in which a prominent part is played by a variety of tuned bells, gongs, and metallophones.

(1992). Harvey Jonathan. "Moruos Plango, Vivos Voco: A Realization at IRCAM", ''The Music Machine'', p.92. {{ISBN|978-0-262-68078-3}}. Harvey added, "a clearly audible, slow-decaying partial at 347 Hz with a beating component in it. It is a resultant of the various F harmonic series partials that can be clearly seen in the spectrum (5, [6], 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, etc.) beside the C-related partials."&lt;/ref&gt; "The bell produces a secondary pitch (f') which lies outside that 'inharmonic series though it is clearly audible when the bell is struck, 'to curiously thrilling and disturbing effect.'"&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Michael (2009). ''Jonathan Harvey: Song offerings and White as jasmine'', p.22. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6022-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Jonathan Harvey - Winchester Cathedral bell spectrum.mid|Play approximation}} The strike tone is [[middle C]], the hum tone an octave below.]]

The tuning of a bell is completely dependent on its shape. When first cast it is approximately correct, but it is then machined on a tuning lathe to remove metal until it is in tune. This is a very complex exercise which took centuries of empirical practice, and latterly modern acoustic science, to understand.

If a bell is part of a set to be rung or played together, then the initial dominant perceived sound, called the strike note, must be tuned to a designated note of a common scale. In addition each bell will emit harmonics, or partials, which must also be tuned so that these are not discordant with the bell's strike note. This is what Fuller-Maitland writing in ''Grove's dictionary of music and musicians'' meant when he said : "Good tone means that a bell must be in tune with itself."&lt;ref name="Groves"/&gt;

The principal partials are;
* hum note -an octave below the strike note,  
* strike note
* tierce - minor third above the strike note 
* quint - perfect fifth above the strike note
* nominal - octave above the strike note

Further, less dominant, partials include the major, third and perfect fifth in the octave above these.

"Whether a founder tunes the nominal or the strike note makes little difference, however, because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tuning of the strike note."&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;Neville Horner Fletcher, Thomas D. Rossing (1998). ''The Physics of Musical Instruments'', p.685. {{ISBN|978-0-387-98374-5}}. Cites Schoofs et al., 1987 for major-third bell.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy clapper brings out lower partials (clappers often being about 3% of a bell's mass), while a higher clapper velocity strengthens higher partials (0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s being moderate).  The relative depth of the "bowl" or "cup" part of the bell also determines the number and strength of the partials in order to achieve a desired timbre.

Bells are generally around 80% copper and 20% tin ([[bell metal]]), with the tone varying according to material.

Tone and pitch is also affected by the method in which a bell is struck. Asian large bells are often bowl shaped but lack the lip and are often not free-swinging. Also note the special shape of [[Bianzhong]] bells, allowing two tones. The scaling or size of most bells to each other may be approximated by the equation for circular cylinders:

''f=Ch/D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'',

where ''h'' is thickness, ''D'' is diameter, and ''C'' is a constant determined by the material and the profile.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"&gt;Rossing, Thomas D. (2000). ''Science of Percussion Instruments'', p.139. {{ISBN|978-981-02-4158-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The major third bell===
On the theory that pieces in major keys may better be accommodated, after many unsatisfactory attempts, in the 1980s, using computer modeling for assistance in design by scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, bells with a major-third profile were created by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name="Physics"/&gt; being described as resembling old Coke bottles&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.yale.edu/~douglas-craig/bells/Basic/what-is-a-carillon.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that they have a bulge around the middle;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm Major third bell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230102/http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm |date=2007-10-18 }}", ''Andrelehr.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"/&gt;

'''Carl Frederick Kraenzel''' (November 1, 1906 – July 26, 1980) was an American [[sociologist]].  Most of Kraenzel’s work focuses on the people of the [[Great Plains]], covering a range of topics including quality of life, power relations, resource use, and mental health. Kraenzel has been widely published in  a variety of professional journals, monographs, research bulletins, special reports and books in the fields of [[rural sociology]], [[Great Plains]] sociology, and natural resource sociology.  His most known work, ''The Great Plains in Transition'' describes the challenges of social life and connections to the natural environments in the North American semiarid region located between the [[98th meridian west|98th meridian]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Born in [[Hebron, North Dakota]], Kraenzel grew up on a farm in the countryside of the Northern Great Plains and witnessed first-hand the challenges of rural life and living in the region.    Kraenzel attended the University of North Dakota for his undergraduate degree, and continued on to do graduate work at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he received his Ph.D in 1935. Kraenzel served as a professor of sociology at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] for many years, and later at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]].

The '''Centre for Quantum Computation''' ('''CQC''') is an alliance of [[quantum information]] research groups at the [[University of Oxford]]. It was founded by [[Artur Ekert]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istl.org/09-spring/internet.html/ Quantum Computing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207074006/http://www.istl.org/09-spring/internet.html/ |date=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998.

Until recently, the CQC also included research groups at the [[University of Cambridge]], but now the Cambridge groups operate as an independent entity called the '''Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations''' ('''CQIF''').

==Research==
The CQC conducts theoretical and experimental research into [[quantum computing]], [[quantum cryptography]] and other forms of [[quantum information processing]], into the implications of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of information for [[physics]] itself, and into foundational and conceptual questions in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[quantum information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordquantum.org/ |title=Oxford Quantum |publisher=Oxford Quantum |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Centre has its origins in the early 80's when the computer industry began to worry about the limits of computing. In 1981, Oxford physicist [[David Deutsch]] attended a party in Texas given by the famous American physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] who had invited a number of scientists interested in the foundations of computing. It was at this party that Deutsch gained the crucial insight that would lead to an entirely new branch of physics. At the time, computer scientists were turning to [[Newtonian physics]] to try to resolve certain fundamental puzzles in the field. But during a conversation at Wheeler’s party, Deutsch realised that this was the wrong approach. Physics is fundamentally governed by quantum theory, and Deutsch could see immediately that using quantum theory instead of Newtonian physics would give a different result. As a consequence of this insight, Deutsch published the paper in 1985 that is now generally regarded as a classic in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030915061044/http://www.qubit.org/oldsite/resource/deutsch85.pdf  Deutsch, David (July 1985). "Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer". Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences 400 (1818): pp. 97–117. ] {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1985.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper describes how a computer might run using quantum mechanics and why such a computer is fundamentally different from ordinary computers.

In 1987, Artur Ekert arrived at Oxford to work on a PhD at the Department of Physics, where he met Deutsch. Whilst working at Oxford, Ekert developed a theory of cryptography based on quantum entanglement. A chance meeting on the ski slopes of the Alps with [[John Rarity]], a scientist at [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]] (the UK’s military research organisation), led to a collaboration in which Ekert’s scheme was tested experimentally in the early 90's. After finishing his phd, Ekert gained a junior research fellowship from [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] and took on his first PhD student. With Deutsch, this created a small team that within a year had acquired the title of the Quantum Computation and Cryptography Group.

A breakthrough in 1994 by [[Peter Shor]], a researcher at the labs of the American telecommunications giant [[AT&amp;T]], boosted the entire field of quantum information. Shor showed that Deutch’s quantum computer could actually solve an important problem that an ordinary computer would find impossible. For the first time, it became clear that quantum computers were far from unimportant curiosities. After Shor’s announcement, quantum information became increasingly popular with Oxford. In 1995, [[Andrew Steane]] began an experimental effort to study how quantum computers might be built from ionised atoms trapped by laser beams. In 1996, [[Jonathan A. Jones|Jonathan Jones]] started a group working on a quantum computer based on the same techniques used in magnetic resonance imaging in medicine.  And two years later, [[Dirk Bouwmeester]] arrived from [[Geneva]] to begin an experimental group working out how the quantum world could also revolutionise communication. The group changed its name to the Centre from Quantum Computation.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Today, feature on Quantum Computing, 27 Oct 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

When Artur Ekert moved to Cambridge to become the first Leigh Trapnell Professor of Quantum Physics in 2002, the '''Cambridge Centre for Quantum Computation''' was created. It continued under this name until 2010, when the existing research group was joined by [[Richard Jozsa]], and the centre was renamed the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations (CQIF), reflecting the broad range of its research activities.
The Cambridge CQIF is based at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), within the Centre for Mathematical Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cam.qubit.org/node/30/ |title=Visiting CQIF |publisher=Cam.qubit.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009003719/http://cam.qubit.org/node/30# |archive-date=2011-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate ethics''' is an area of research that focuses on the ethical dimensions of climate change (also known as [[global warming]]), and concepts such as [[climate justice]].

Human-induced climate change raises many profound [[Ethics|ethical]] questions, yet many {{Who||date=February 2012}} believe that these ethical issues have not been addressed adequately in climate change policy debates or in the scientific and economic literature on climate change; and that, consequently, ethical questions are being overlooked or obscured in climate negotiations, policies and discussions . It has been pointed out that those most responsible for climate change are not the same people as those most vulnerable to its effects.

Terms such as [[climate justice]] and ecological justice ('eco justice') are used worldwide, and have been adopted by various organizations.

== Overview ==

An article in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (Patz, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Impact of regional climate change on human health|volume=438|pages=310–317|date=17 November 2005|doi=10.1038/nature04188|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04188.html|first1=Jonathan A|last1=Patz|first2=Diarmid|last2=Campbell-Lendrum|first3=Tracey|last3=Holloway|first4=Jonathan A|last4=Foley|bibcode=2005Natur.438..310P}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the human-induced warming that the world is now experiencing is already causing 150,000 deaths and 5 million incidents of disease each year from additional [[malaria]] and [[diarrhea]], mostly in the poorest nations.  Death and disease incidents are likely to soar as warming increases. Facts such as this demonstrate that climate change is compromising rights to life, liberty and personal security.  Hence, ethical analysis of climate change policy must examine how that policy  impacts on those basic rights.

Climate change raises a number of particularly challenging ethical issues about [[distributive justice]], in particular concerning how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems such as [[cost-benefit analysis]] usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution.

== ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' ==

In December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' was launched at the 10th Conference of Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].  The major outcome of this meeting was the Buenos Aires Declaration on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change.

===Objectives===
The program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change seeks to:
*Facilitate express examination of ethical dimensions of climate change particularly for those issues entailed by specific positions taken by governments, businesses, NGOs, organizations, or individuals on climate change policy matters;
*Create better understanding about the ethical dimensions of climate change among policy makers and the general public;
*Assure that people around the world, including those most vulnerable to climate change, participate in any ethical inquiry about responses to climate change;
*Develop an interdisciplinary approach to inquiry about the ethical dimensions of climate change and support publications that examine the ethical dimensions of climate change;
*Make the results of scholarship on the ethical dimensions of climate change available to and accessible to policy makers, scientists, and citizen groups;
*Integrate ethical analysis into the work of other institutions engaged in climate change policy including the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.

===Position===
Given the severity of impact to be expected and given the likelihood that some level of important disruptions in living conditions will occur for great numbers of people due to climate change events, this group contends that there is sufficient convergence among ethical principles to make a number of concrete recommendations on how governments should act, or identify ethical problems with positions taken by certain governments, organizations, or individuals.

Facts about climate change and fundamental human rights provide the starting point for climate ethics.

'''Cognitive geography''' is an interdisciplinary study of cognitive science and geography. It aims to understand how humans view space, place, and environment. It involves the formalization of factors that influence our spatial cognition to create a more effective representation of space. These improved models assist in a variety of issues, for example, the developing maps that communicate better, providing navigation instructions that are easier to follow, utilizing space more practically, accounting for the cultural differences on spatial thinking for more effective cross-cultural information exchange, and an overall increased understanding of our environment.

Notable researchers in this branch of geography include [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]], [[Daniel R. Montello|Daniel Montello]], Max J. Egenhofer, [[Andrew U. Frank|Andrew U Frank]], Christian Freksa, [[Edward C. Tolman|Edward Tolman]], and [[Barbara Tversky]], among others.

Conference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT) is a biennial international conference with a focus on the theoretical aspect of space and spatial information.

The US National Research Council published a book titled, “Learning to think spatially (2006)” written by the Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially. The committee believes that incorporating GIS and other spatial technologies in K-12 curriculum would promote spatial thinking and reasoning.

== Origin and early works ==
The connection between spatial cognition and human activity and survival exists from ancient times. As learned from etymology, geometry has its origins in land surveying of the annual floods of the Nile river.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=David M.|last2=Freksa|first2=Christian|last3=Hirtle|first3=Stephen C.|last4=Lloyd|first4=Robert|last5=Tversky|first5=Barbara|date=1999-12-01|title=Cognitive models of geographical space|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136588199241003|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=13|issue=8|pages=747–774|doi=10.1080/136588199241003|issn=1365-8816}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spatial cognition]] developed from the study of cognitive psychology which began to be considered as a separate field in the late 1960s through [[Ulric Neisser]]’s book ''Cognitive Psychology'' (1967).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, research on spatial cognition was hindered due to many leading researchers believing that visual and spatial world could be explained using language processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later on, research on imagery showed that by reducing the representation of the visual and spatial world into language researchers ignored ‘fascinating’ issues.&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, Stephen Michael. ''Image and mind''. Harvard University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1978-01-01|title=Cognitive processes that resemble perceptual processes.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1978-19902-007|journal=APA PsycNET|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, geographers were studying how people perceived and remembered the geographical world.&lt;ref&gt;O'keefe, John, and Lynn Nadel. ''The hippocampus as a cognitive map''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive geography and [[behavioral geography]] draw from early [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "cognitive maps". More cognitively oriented, these geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are [[Materialism|materialists]] and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the [[landscape]] patterns or even [[Collective identity|group identity]].&lt;ref name="Norton97"&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of early works on Cognitive Geography include [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman’s]] `Cognitive maps in rats and men’ compared the behavior of laboratory rats with the navigation and wayfinding abilities of humans. Similar work during that period dealt with the peoples’ perception of direction and spatial relations, for example, Americans typically think that South America is aligned directly south of North America when in fact most of South America is much further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Barbara|date=1981-07-01|title=Distortions in memory for maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028581900165|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=13|issue=3|pages=407–433|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 70s, the focus was on how to improve maps by providing useful information, delivering an understandable message, and making it more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research in cognitive geography ==
The interaction between humans and the environment is a major focus among the Geographers. The objective of this research area is to minimize the disparity between the environment and its geometric representation and the removal of spatial cognitive biases that are inherent. Examples of spatial cognitive biases include the overestimation of distance between two locations when there is a large number of intersections and nodes in the path. There is a tendency to recollect irregular streets or rivers as straighter, more parallel, or more perpendicular than they are. [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]] through his research illustrates how spatial features like inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, lagoons) are categorized differently in English and French speaking population, and therefore, could cause issues in cross-cultural geographical information exchange.

Studies have been done on wayfinding and navigation. Wayfinding is defined as “the mental processes involved in determining a route between two points and then following that route” and involves planning trips, optimizing routes, and exploring different places. The researchers are trying to find the perfect amount of information, not more and not less, for making navigation more efficient. Landmarks play an important factor in wayfinding and navigation, therefore, researchers are looking to automate the selection of landmarks which would make maps easier to follow.

Displaying information through maps has been shaped by how humans sense space and direction. Communicating effectively through maps is a challenge for many cartographers. For example, symbols, their color, and their relative size have an important role to play in the interaction between the map and the mapmaker.

The study of Geo-ontology has also been of interest to researchers in this field. Geo-ontology involves the study of the variations among different cultures in how they view and sense landforms, how to communicate spatial knowledge with other cultures while overcoming such barriers, an understanding of the cognitive aspects of spatial relations, and how to represent them in computational models.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, David M. "Spatial representation: a cognitive view." ''Geographical information systems: Principles and applications'' 1 (1999): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there might be some geographic meaning that might not be well explained using words. There might be some differences in understanding when spatial information is explained verbally instead of non-verbal form.

Some of the questions that cognitive geographers deal with include the influence of scale on the information provided in maps, the difference in how we view geographic knowledge differently from different sources, for example, text-based, map-based, or any real-world experience. A typical study in Cognitive Geography involves volunteers responding to a questionnaire after being shown some spatial information. The researchers use this data to find the spectrum of interpretations by the volunteers about the subject in focus.&lt;ref&gt;Montello, Daniel R. "Cognitive research in GIScience: Recent achievements and future prospects." ''Geography Compass'' 3.5 (2009): 1824-1840.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montello, Daniel R. "Cognitive geography." (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Covenant of Mayors'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/covenantofmayors_text_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a European co-operation movement involving local and regional authorities. Signatories of the Covenant of Mayors voluntarily commit to increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and the use of [[renewable energy]] sources on their territories. By their commitment, they support the [[European Union]] 20% {{CO2}} reduction objective to be reached by 2020.

After the [[European Union climate and energy package]] was adopted in 2008, the [[European Commission]] launched the Covenant of Mayors to endorse and support the efforts deployed by local authorities in the implementation of sustainable energy policies. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-change/mayors-commit-exceeding-eu-climate-goals/article-179356&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covenant of Mayors Signatories ==

European [[local authorities]] of all sizes – from small villages to capitals and [[major metropolitan area]]s – are eligible to sign up as Covenant of Mayors Signatories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/about/signatories_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities, towns and other urban areas have a crucial role to play in mitigating climate change, as they consume three quarter of the energy produced in the European Union and are responsible for a similar share of {{CO2}} emissions. Local authorities are also in a position to change citizens' behaviour and address climate and energy questions in a comprehensive manner, notably by conciliating public and private interests and by integrating [[sustainable energy]] issues into overall local development goals.

== Formal undertakings ==

To meet the {{CO2}} reduction targets they set themselves, signatories commit to a series of steps and accept to report and be monitored on their actions. Within predefined time frames, they formally undertake to fulfil the following:

* Develop adequate administrative structures, including allocation of sufficient human resources, in order to undertake the necessary actions;
* Prepare a '''Baseline Emission Inventory''';
* Submit a '''Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' within the year following the official adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors initiative, and including concrete measures leading to at least 20% reduction of {{CO2}} emissions by 2020;
* Submit an '''implementation report''' at least '''every second year after submission of their Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' for evaluation, monitoring and verification purposes

To comply with the crucial necessity of mobilising local stakeholders in the development of the Sustainable Energy Action Plans, signatories also undertake to:

* Share experience and know-how with other local authorities;
* '''Organise Local Energy Days''' to raise citizens awareness of sustainable development and energy efficiency;
* Attend or contribute to the Covenant of Mayors annual ceremony, thematic workshops and discussion group meetings;
* Spread the message of the Covenant in the appropriate fora and, in particular, encourage other mayors to join the Covenant.

== Sustainable Energy Action Plans ==

To reach and try to exceed the European Union energy and climate objectives, Covenant of Mayors signatories commit to develop a '''Sustainable Energy Action Plan''' (SEAP), within a year following their adhesion to the initiative. This action plan, approved by the municipal council, outlines the activities and measures foreseen by signatories to fulfil their commitments, with corresponding time frames and assigned responsibilities.

Various technical and methodological supporting materials (including the "SEAP Guidebook" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/seap_guidelines_en-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and template, reports on existing methodologies and tools, etc.) offer practical guidance and clear recommendations on the whole SEAP development process. Based on the practical experiences of local authorities and developed in close co-operation with the European Commission Joint Research Centre, this support package provides Covenant signatories with key principles and a clear step-by-step approach. All documents are downloadable on the www.eumayors.eu website library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumayors.eu/support/library_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coordination and support ==
=== Covenant Coordinators and Supporters ===

Covenant Signatories do not always possess the adequate tools and resources to prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory, draft the related Sustainable Energy Action Plan and finance the actions featured in the latter. In light of this, provinces, regions, networks and groupings of municipalities have a crucial role to play in helping signatories honour their commitments.

'''Covenant Coordinators''' are public authorities from different government levels (national, regional, provincial) which provide strategic guidance to signatories, as well as financial and technical support in the development and implementation of their Sustainable Energy Action Plans. The Commission distinguishes between "Territorial Coordinators", which are sub-national decentralised authorities – including provinces, regions and public groupings of municipalities -, and "National Coordinators", which include national public bodies – such as national energy agencies and ministries of energy.

'''Covenant Supporters''' are European, national and regional networks and associations of local authorities which leverage their lobbying, communication and networking activities to promote the Covenant of Mayors initiative and support the commitments of its signatories.

=== Covenant of Mayors Office ===

Promotional, technical and administrative assistance is provided on a daily basis to Covenant signatories and stakeholders by the Covenant of Mayors Office (CoMO), managed by a consortium of local and regional authorities' networks, led by [[Energy Cities]] and composed of [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions|CEMR]], [[Climate Alliance]], [[Eurocities]] and [[FEDARENE]]. Funded by the [[European Commission]], the CoMO is responsible for the overall co-ordination of the initiative.

=== Institutions of the European Union ===

To support the elaboration and implementation the signatories' Sustainable Energy Action Plans, the [[European Commission]] has contributed to the development of financial facilities particularly targeting Covenant of Mayors signatories, among which the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) facility, set up in co-operation with the [[European Investment Bank]], for large-scale projects, and ELENA-KfW which, established in partnership with the German Group [[KfW]], offers a complementary approach to mobilise sustainable investments of small and medium-sized municipalities.

Alongside the [[European Commission]], the Covenant benefits from full institutional support, including from the [[Committee of the Regions]], which has supported the initiative since its inception; the [[European Parliament]], where the two first signing ceremonies were held; and the [[European Investment Bank]], which assists local authorities in unlocking their investment potentials.

=== Joint Research Centre ===

The [[Joint Research Centre]] of the [[European Commission]] is responsible for providing technical and scientific support to the initiative. It works in close collaboration with the Covenant of Mayors Office to equip signatories with clear technical guidelines and templates to assist delivery of their Covenant of Mayors commitments, as well as to monitor implementation and results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18827">'''Debt-for-nature swaps''' are financial transactions in which a portion of a [[developing nation]]'s foreign debt is forgiven in exchange for local investments in environmental conservation measures.

==History==
The debt-for-nature swaps concept was first conceived by [[Thomas Lovejoy]] of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in 1984 as an opportunity to deal with the problems of developing-nation indebtedness and its consequent deleterious effect on the environment.&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Dana R. |first2=Guillermo A. |last2=Mendoza |year=1994 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps in Latin America |journal=Journal of Forestry |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=13–6 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;issn=0022-1201&amp;volume=92&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=13&amp;epage=16&amp;aulast=Visser }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Latin American debt crisis]] that resulted in steep reductions to the environmental conservation ability of highly indebted nations, Lovejoy suggested that ameliorating debt promoting conservation could be done at the same time. Since the first swap occurred between [[Conservation International]] and Bolivia in 1987, many national governments and conservation organizations have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps. Most swaps occur in tropical countries, which contain many [[biodiversity|diverse species]] of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reilly |first1=William |year=2006 |chapter=Using International Finance to Further Conservation: The First 15 Years of Debt-for-Nature Swaps |pages=197–214 |chapterurl={{Google books|HuPwt987R7gC|page=197|plainurl=yes}} |title=Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Jochnick |editor2-first=Fraser A. |editor2-last=Preston |isbn=978-0-19-803752-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, countries that have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps typically have several threatened or endangered species, experience rapid [[deforestation]], and have relatively stable, often democratic, political systems.&lt;ref name=Deacon&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3147074 |jstor=3147074 |title=The Structure of an Environmental Transaction: The Debt-for-Nature Swap |journal=Land Economics |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=1997 |last1=Deacon |first1=Robert T |last2=Murphy |first2=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, debt-for-nature agreements have generated over US$1 billion for conservation in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh&gt;{{cite web |first=Pervaze A. |last=Sheikh |date=March 30, 2010 |title=Debt-for-Nature Initiatives and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act: Status and Implementation |url=https://www.cbd.int/financial/debtnature/g-inventory2010.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The financing mechanism for debt-for-nature swaps is an agreement among the funder(s), the national government of the debtor country, and the conservation organization(s) using the funds.  The national government of the indebted country agrees to a payment schedule on the amount of the debt forgiven, usually paid through the nation’s central bank, in local currency or bonds. The process is shown in Figure 1.
Participation in debt-for-nature swaps has been restricted primarily to countries where the risk of default on debt payments is high.&lt;ref name=Greiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2006.07.001 |title=Supporting on-farm biodiversity conservation through debt-for-conservation swaps: Concept and critique |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=458–71 |year=2007 |last1=Greiner |first1=Romy |last2=Lankester |first2=Allyson }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances, the funder can purchase the debt at well below its [[face value]].
[[File:Debt-for-nature.png|thumb|Figure 1: The general mechanics of a debt-for-nature swap.]]

==Types==
In a '''commercial debt-for-nature swap''' or '''three-party debt-for-nature swap''', a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) acts as the funder/donor and purchases debt titles from commercial banks on the [[secondary market]]. Since the late 1980s, organizations such as [[Conservation International]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have participated in international debt-for-nature swaps. The NGO transfers the debt title to the debtor country, and in exchange the country agrees to either enact certain environmental policies or endow a government bond in the name of a conservation organization, with the aim of funding conservation programs.In total, recorded third-party debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$140 million in conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

'''Bilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' take place between two governments. In a bilateral swap, a creditor country forgives a portion of the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that country.&lt;ref name=Deacon /&gt; An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. '''Multilateral debt-for-nature swaps''' are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt; A closely related form of debt swap is a debt-for-efficiency swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/ejdr.2013.34 |title=Financing the Clean Development Mechanism through Debt-for-Efficiency Swaps?

===Funders===
[[Nature Conservancy]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio|Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation]], Oak Foundation and [[Global Environment Facility]] have previously provided funds to pay to the debts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/ldf-supports-first-ever-debt-for-nature-swap-in-seychelles/{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Debt for nature swaps have often been described as agreements in which all parties benefit and that there are no disadvantages. The benefits to the debtor country, creditor, and conservation organizations are outlined below.

===For debtors===
Through a debt-for-nature swap, a debtor country reduces its total outstanding external debt. The debtor country is able to buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service.&lt;ref name="Potier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0264-8377(91)90034-G |title=Debt-for-nature swaps |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=211–3 |year=1991 |last1=Potier |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to higher international purchasing power for the debtor country.&lt;ref name="Cassimon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.10.001 |title=The pitfalls and potential of debt-for-nature swaps: A US-Indonesian case study |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=93–102 |year=2011 |last1=Cassimon |first1=Danny |last2=Prowse |first2=Martin |last3=Essers |first3=Dennis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt; Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

If the country is interested in funding conservation, debt-for-nature swaps provide an additional source of funds for that purpose. In contrast to [[debt-for-equity swap]]s, debt-for-nature swaps do not compromise national sovereignty since no property exchange takes place.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

Environmental benefits to the debtor country include but are not limited to:
* promoting [[sustainable development|responsible resource use]]
* helping to preserve [[biodiversity]] 
* maintaining [[ecosystem services]]
* reducing [[deforestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2011.01245.x |title=Do Commercial Debt-for-Nature Swaps Matter for Forests? A Cross-National Test of World Polity Theory |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=381–410 |year=2011 |last1=Shandra |first1=John M |last2=Restivo |first2=Michael |last3=Shircliff |first3=Eric |last4=London |first4=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment in conservation also demonstrates economic returns. For example, Costa Rica has put debt-for-nature funds to good use in establishing and improving parks and preserves, and it has seen marked improvements in tourism, improved water quality, and increased energy output even in the short term.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;

===For creditors===
Creditors see debt-for-nature swaps as a method to rid themselves of high-risk claims. By selling the debt claim, they can re-invest the proceeds from the sale in higher-performing ventures. Creditors faced with low-performance loans may also seek to limit their exposure, that is, to avoid further lending to debtor countries until their loans are serviced.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

===For conservation organizations===
Debt-for-nature agreements are a long-term source of funding for conservation initiatives, so both international organizations acting as donors and local organizations using funds are able to further their goals of conservation. The donor organizations also purchase the debt at a value below its face value and usually redeem it above its market value. In this way, swaps are thought to generate conservation funds at a discount.&lt;ref name=Greiner /&gt;

==Decline==
The decline in the number of debt-for-nature swaps in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of commercial debt in secondary markets.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resor |first1=J.P. |year=1997 |title=Debt-for-nature swaps: a decade of experience and new directions for the future |journal=Unasylva |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w3247e/w3247e06.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Additionally, other agreements for [[debt restructuring]] and cancellation, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution debt-for-nature swaps make.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;
Also, debt-for-nature swaps have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.

==Criticism==

===Overstated financial benefits===
Debt-for-nature swaps produce only minor debt reductions and generate far less funding than the face value of the debt purchased in the secondary market.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt; The amount of public debt relieved by debt-for-nature swaps, even in the countries that participate in swaps regularly, accounts for less than 1% of total external debt.&lt;ref name=Didia&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00213624.2001.11506382 |title=Debt-for-Nature Swaps, Market Imperfections, and Policy Failures as Determinants of Sustainable Development and Environmental Quality |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=477–86 |year=2016 |last1=Didia |first1=Dal }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, if the indebted country does not engage in conservation in the absence of a debt-for-nature agreement, the swap may not provide the indebted country a [[welfare economics|social welfare improvement]] or any [[fiscal space]] in the national budget.&lt;ref name=Cassimon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garvie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garvie |first1=Devon A. |year=2002 |title=When are Debt for Nature Swaps Welfare—Improving? |journal=International Review of Economics and Business |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=165–73 |url=http://econ.queensu.ca/faculty/garvie/mini/garviedfns.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the indebted country is still responsible for payment of the debt, albeit to a conservation organization rather than to the creditor. Also, the funds produced through the agreement may replace other forms of aid, debt assistance, or conservation funding.

===Misdirection of funds===
Critics of debt-for-nature swaps argue that they do not generate funds where the needs are greatest.&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Early in the history of debt-for-nature swaps, nearly three-quarters of the total funds generated went to Costa Rica, while other countries with needs equal to or exceeding those of Costa Rica did not receive any.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107049659300200203 |title=Policy Responses to Tropical Deforestation: Are Debt-for-Nature Swaps Appropriate? |journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=41–65 |year=2016 |last1=Kraemer |first1=Moritz |last2=Hartmann |first2=Jörg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil, for example, has had limited involvement in debt-for-nature swaps though it has experienced rapid deforestation.&lt;ref name=Sheikh /&gt;

===Environmental degradation and external debt===
Research has shown that debt relief alone does not spur environmental conservation. Though debt shows a positive correlation with deforestation levels, most researchers believe that highly indebted countries lack political institutions and enforcement structures that would limit [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; Heavily indebted countries may engage in high levels of deforestation due to shortsighted policies.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00019-5 |title=Institutions and the Environmental Kuznets Curve for Deforestation: A Crosscountry Analysis for Latin America, Africa and Asia |journal=World Development |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=995–1010 |year=2001 |last1=Bhattarai |first1=Madhusudan |last2=Hammig |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that the solutions to environmental degradation are effective political institutions, democracy, property rights, and market structures,&lt;ref name=Didia /&gt; and this development theory matches many of the principles of the [[Washington Consensus]]. Others suggest that primarily wealth creation and increased income have a positive impact on environmental conservation.&lt;ref name=Bhattarai /&gt; This approach considers an environmental [[Kuznets curve]], by which environmental degradation increases, reaches a tipping point, then decreases as income or wealth increases.

===Insufficient funding of environmental protection===
Ultimately, the responsibility of conservation lies with the local non-governmental organization implementing the protection measures. Debt-for-nature swaps are only effective when the conservation organizations are respected by local residents, have a good financial management capacity, and have a good relationship with government and other non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Potier /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resor /&gt;

===Impacts on the poor===
Debt for nature swaps are usually actioned by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned or at least used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms. Some early debt-for-nature swaps tended to overlook the people living on the land set aside for conservation.&lt;ref name=Choudry&gt;{{cite web |last=Choudry |first=Aziz |date=October 2003 |title=Conservation International: Privatizing Nature, Plundering Biodiversity |work=Seedling |url=https://www.grain.org/es/article/entries/406-conservation-international-privatizing-nature-plundering-biodiversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; Although "seeking" to include does not mean that local residents have been included. Reports of recent debt swap cases in Madagascar, for instance, indicate local resentment towards conservation projects.&lt;ref name=Eurozine&gt;http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-02-28-bloch-en.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denise Marie Stapley''' (née '''McCormick'''; born January 1, 1971) is an American sex therapist known as the winner of ''[[Survivor: Philippines]]'', the 25th season of the reality TV competition series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.

Stapley is a licensed [[mental health]] [[therapist]] and the only [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] certified sex therapist in the state of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denisestapleytherapy.com/About_Denise.html|title=About Denise|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Survivor'' ==
Stapley competed on the 25th season of the reality TV series ''Survivor'', ''Survivor: Philippines''. Originally placed on the ill-fated "Matsing" tribe, she and Malcolm Freberg were the only two castaways remaining when the tribe lost the first four consecutive immunity challenges, voting off Zane Knight, Roxanne "Roxy" Morris, Angie Layton, and Russell Swan by unanimous votes each time. Afterwards, Freberg was sent to the "Tandang" tribe while Stapley was sent to the "Kalabaw" tribe. Kalabaw subsequently lost the next two consecutive challenges, and in the first of these two tribal councils, Stapley received one vote from Sarah Dawson, while everyone else voted out Dawson. When the merge came, Stapley was on the winning team in the first two consecutive team-oriented reward challenges, and otherwise won the first individual immunity challenge right after the merge. She and Freberg managed to ride out the conflict between the members of the two former tribes, since both were perceived as outsiders who had no conflict with anyone else. However, Stapley was almost eliminated at the final seven, when she received the three votes of [[Jonathan Penner]], Abi-Maria Gomes, and Carter Williams. However, Stapley, Freberg, [[Lisa Whelchel]], and [[Michael Skupin]] voted for Penner, eliminating him instead. In the final two consecutive tribal councils, Stapley found herself receiving the sole vote of the person who was eliminated, while everyone else voted for said person: Gomes at the final five and Freberg at the final four. Stapley ultimately made it to the final three, alongside Whelchel and Skupin, where all three were mostly grilled by the jury of eight. However, Stapley was occasionally praised for making it to the end as a perceived underdog, surviving the ill-fated Matsing tribe, and the numerous tribal councils she attended. When the time for voting came, Stapley received six votes (all except Williams, who voted for Skupin, and Roberta "RC" Saint-Amour, who voted for Whelchel), thus winning the title of "Sole Survivor" and the $1 million prize.

As a result of her win, Stapley became the oldest female winner in ''Survivor'' history at age 41. She also set a ''Survivor'' record for becoming the first (and currently only) person in the history of the show to attend every single tribal council in the entire season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/12/17/survivor-philippines-finale-winner-denise-stapley/|title='Survivor: Philippines' winner Denise Stapley reveals the person still mad at her, and that she is the one that told Penner about Lisa's past|last=Ross|first=Dalton|date=December 17, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/survivor-winner-denise-stapley-1057901.aspx|title=Denise Stapley on Survivor Win: "I Played a Very Quiet But Smart Game"|last=Raftery|first=Liz|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview, host [[Jeff Probst]] named Stapley as one of his top 10 favorite ''Survivor'' winners ever, and one of his top 4 favorite female winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parade.com/377297/joshwigler/jeff-probst-names-his-top-ten-survivor-winners-of-all-time/|title=Jeff Probst Names His Top Ten Survivor Winners Of All Time|first=Josh|last=Wigler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital civics''' refers a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] and responsible civic behaviours, [[citizenship]], or democratic engagement in the [[Internet|digital realm]]. The term itself is still establishing currency.

== Context ==

Digital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.

== Definitions ==

Researcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as “the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the infosphere and access the world digitally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] at the time, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]]. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world.

According to Clements this definition meets three objectives:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# It promotes an understanding of the environment where civic actions take place;
# It acknowledges the information philosophy that underpins this environment;
# It endorses the policy discourse that addresses the basic rights and ethical responsibilities of citizens.

Other conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. [[Newcastle University]] has suggested that Digital Civics is about “Digital technologies and citizen-driven design”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/about/|title=About|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of information ==

Numerous scholars have suggested that the [[Philosophy of Information]] is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Media Ethics.|last=Ess|first=Charles|publisher=Polity Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|date=2009|title=The Information Society and its Philosophy|url=|journal=The Information Society|volume=25(3)|pages=153–158.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of [[Information society|Information Society]], European Policy, and [[European Commission]]’s Onlife initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319040929|title=The Onlife Manifesto - Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era {{!}} Luciano Floridi|publisher=Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Clements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estelle|first=Clements,|date=2017|title=Digital Civics in Pedagogy: A Response to the Challenges of Digital Convergence in the Educational Environment|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/appadoc/88/|journal=ARROW@DIT|language=en|doi=10.21427/D7J45F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcivics.org/about/|title=What is Digital Civics|last=|first=|date=2018|website=digitalcivics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underlying pillars of Digital Civics   ===

Philosophy (specifically the [[Philosophy of information|Philosophy of Information]] as described by Luciano Floridi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Floridi|date=2002|title=What is the philosophy of information|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=33|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  
 
History (drawing from [[Media ecology|Media Ecology]] and [[Classics|Classical scholarship]]),

Ethics (particularly [[Virtue ethics|Virtue Ethics]])

Civics (including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ess|first=Charles|date=2010|title=The Embodied Self in a Digital Age: Possibilities, Risks, and Prospects for a Pluralistic (democratic/liberal) Future?|url=|journal=Nordicom Information|volume=32(2)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Key concepts for Digital Civics ===
- It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave.

- It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways.

- And it appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges.

- Fundamental to Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.

== Contention of digital civics and virtue ethics ==

In considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use [[virtue ethics]] as a basis for a shared global [[information ethics]]: namely, Charles Ess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Ess|date=2010|title=Trust and New Communications Technologies: Vicious Circles, Virtuous Circles, Possible Futures.|url=|journal=Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=23(3-4)|pages=287–305|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shannon Vallor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting.|last=Vallor|first=Shannon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Volkman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Richard|date=2010|title=Why Information Ethics must begin with Virtue Ethics|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=41|pages=380–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Information philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics because virtue ethics is “intrinsically egopoeitic”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Information|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge handbook of information and computer ethics|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this matter is still contested.

== Educational programs ==

In 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]] and the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]'s, Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements’ doctoral work which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in [[Pedagogy]]. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014 Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab . The program research concentrates on “exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/|title=Digital Civics at Open Lab|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/apply/|title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Civics|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: “a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcivicstoolkit.org/|title=Digital Civics Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on 5 modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flora Elizabeth Burchenal''' (October 18, 1875 – November 21, 1959) was an American [[folk dance]] educator. She was a teacher of dance in the New York state public school system as well as an inspector of athletics for the New York Department of Education. Burchenal influenced the cultural conduct of recreational life in the United States, Canada and Europe.

== Early life ==

Burchenal was born on October 18, 1875,{{efn|She subsequently shaved several years off her age, giving her birthdate in 1924 as October 18, 1880&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal, 53, born Richmond, Ind. 10/18/80. ''New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957''&lt;/ref&gt; and October 18, 1881 in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal, "I solemnly swear I was born at Richmond, in the State of Indiana, on or about the 18th day of October, 1881." ''U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925''&lt;/ref&gt; and year of birth as 1885 in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Burchenal; age 40, born Richmond, Indiana, 1885. ''New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957''&lt;/ref&gt;}} in [[Richmond, Indiana]] to Charles Henry Burchenal and his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Day.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}  Her father was a [[Quaker]],&lt;ref&gt;Death of Chas H Burchenal; ''Quaker Meeting Records, 1681-1935''&lt;/ref&gt; and a prominent attorney born in Maryland.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Elizabeth Burchenal, Folk Dance Authority, Dead|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/249797119/?terms=Elizabeth%2BBurchenal|work=Palladium-Item Richmond|date=December 4, 1959|location=Richmond, Indiana|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Ellen, who was born in Ireland, died in 1864, around age 30.

Flora was her given name and later she took on the name Elizabeth (her middle name). Burchenal pronounced her family name "Burchenélle" as was the tradition.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} "Burchenal" shows up as being anglicized to "Brockend" in the 1880 United States Census.&lt;ref name =1880_US_Census/&gt; Burchenal was the second oldest child in the family of four girls and one boy.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} Her childhood folk dance career came from a "musically gifted family circle passing many an hour dancing and singing songs of the old country."{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} She was influenced early in her life towards folk dance by her musician mother who took her on travels to remote mountain cabins by horseback, where she picked up folk dance techniques of the remote mountain village people.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} Her father was especially interested in folklore.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}}

Burchenal attended [[Earlham College]] and graduated in 1896 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in English.{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} She then went to [[Boston University College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (Sargent College)|Boston University Sargent College]], school of physical training. She graduated from Sargent College in 1898.{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} Then after graduation she directed in the department of orthopedics the Medical Gymnasium, which later became [[Boston Children's Hospital|Boston Children's Hospital Medical Center]].{{sfn|Marquis|1999|p=1142}} She directed physical education programs from 1898 to 1902 in Boston as well as Chicago.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

[[File:Highland Fling dance 1910.jpg|thumb|Schoolgirls dancing "Highland Fling" taught by Burchenal from one of her books.{{sfn|Burchenal|1909|p=50-57}}]]

Burchenal became interested in using dance in [[physical education]] and was influenced by the dance educator Melvin Gilbert.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}} She carried his philosophy of dance education to Columbia University. She thought that Gilbert's dance techniques should be taught at the University in their physical training classes.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

Burchenal became a teacher at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] from 1902 to 1905. Here she began her researching of folk dancing not only in the United States, but also the dancing techniques of Canadian and European folk dancers. Beginning in 1904 she traveled around the world gathering folk dance techniques of various countries. {{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}}

Burchenal was next persuaded by the director of New York physical education, [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]], to become a teacher of dance in the state public school system. In this role she excelled and gained higher levels of authority.

In 1913, [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] was so impressed by seeing a group of 2000 Burchenal trained girls folk dancing in a Manhattan public school that she persuaded Burchenal to teach a collection of teachers in Ireland about folk dancing. Before the year was out, Irish national folk dances were a part of the standard physical educational school classes.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

Burchenal did traveling around the United States, Europe, and Canada to not only train teachers the techniques of folk dancing, but also took this traveling opportunity to learn more dances. Often she would take her younger sister who played the piano for the dancing. She influenced the social and cultural conduct of recreational life not only in the United States, but also in Canada and Europe. Burchenal described folk dancing as one of the few times that people of different nationalities and cultures can get together in a common event.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=121}}

The passenger list of the ship Minnetonka shows Burchenal traveling from London and arriving in New York City November 12, 1928. At that time she listed her address as 2700 Broadway in New York City. She was traveling with her older sister Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;AncestoryLibrary.com – New York Passenger Lists, 1820–1957. Roll T715, 1897–1957 &gt; 4001–5000 &gt; Roll 4382&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life and death ==
In 1929 she founded the National Committee of Folk Arts. The American Folk Dance Society, that she had previously founded, became a part of this larger organization. Burchenal directed the Folk Arts Center in New York City, which had a museum and a library on national dance information. {{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} At various international folk dance festivals Burchenal represented the United States.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} 
Oberlaender Trust of the Carl Schurs Memorial Foundation granted her a research fellowship for 1933 and 1934 to study folk dance techniques in Germany.{{sfn|Carkin|1952|p=206}} She was chairperson on several dance related national and international committees and organizations.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}}The 1940 U.S. Census shows her occupation as a writer and living in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;1940 United States Census Place: New York, Kings, New York; Roll: T627_2547; Page 2B; Enumeration District: 24-9&lt;/ref&gt; Burchenal's New York death record shows she died November 21, 1959.&lt;ref name=NYdept_of_health/&gt;

== Awards ==
Burchenal received many honors and awards.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} Some of the notable ones are:

* 1943 – honorary degree by Boston University for Doctor of Science in Physical Education.
* 1950 – Luther Gulick Award for highly regarded service in physical education, the highest award in the field.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=204}}

== Legacy ==
Burchenal became known as America's leading authority on folk dancing.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}} She, along with her older sister Ruth, in 1916 were the organizers of the American Folk Dance Society.{{sfn|Ohles|1978|p=203}} She also founded the Archive of American Folk Dance.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}}

== Works ==
Burchenal wrote over fifteen music and dance related books. These books became reference sources in the field of folk dancing for decades.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=122}} Below are some of her works:

'''''Erewhon: or, Over the Range''''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|r|ɛ|hw|ɒ|n}})&lt;ref&gt;In the preface to the first edition of his book, Butler specified that "The Author wishes it to be understood that Erewhon is pronounced as a word of three syllables, all short—thus, Ĕ-rĕ-whŏn." Nevertheless, the word is occasionally pronounced with two syllables as "air-hwun" or "air-one".&lt;/ref&gt; is a novel by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] which was first published anonymously in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first=|year=1872 |title= Erewhon, or Over the Range |publisher=Trubner &amp; Co. |place=London |edition= 1 |page=  |url=https://archive.org/stream/ErewhonOverrang00Butl#page/ii/mode/2up  |accessdate=5 March 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is also the name of a country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist. In the novel, it is not revealed where Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a [[fictional country]]. Butler meant the title to be understood as the word "nowhere" backwards even though the letters "h" and "w" are transposed.&lt;!-- The common pronunciation of "wh" in his day transposed the two letters, while articulating both.  /ˈnoʊˌhweər/  --&gt;  The book is a satire on [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] society.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''Erewhon'', BBC Home Service, Talks for Schools, 8 June 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are in fact based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand where, as a young man, he worked as a [[sheep station|sheep farmer]] on Mesopotamia Station for about four years (1860–64), and explored parts of the interior of the [[South Island]] and which he wrote about in his ''A First Year in Canterbury Settlement'' (1863).

==Content==
The greater part of the book consists of a description of Erewhon. The nature of this nation is intended to be ambiguous. At first glance, Erewhon appears to be a [[Utopia]], yet it soon becomes clear that this is far from the case. Yet for all the failings of Erewhon, it is also clearly not a [[dystopia]], such as that depicted in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. As a satirical utopia, ''Erewhon'' has sometimes been compared to ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), a classic novel by [[Jonathan Swift]]; the image of Utopia in this latter case also bears strong parallels with the self-view of the [[British Empire]] at the time. It can also be compared to the [[William Morris]] novel, ''[[News from Nowhere]]''.

''Erewhon'' satirises various aspects of [[Victorian era|Victorian society]], including criminal punishment, religion and [[anthropocentrism]]. For example, according to Erewhonian law, offenders are treated as if they were ill, whereas ill people are looked upon as criminals. Another feature of Erewhon is the absence of machines; this is due to the widely shared perception by the Erewhonians that they are potentially dangerous. This last aspect of ''Erewhon'' reveals the influence of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolution theory; Butler had read ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' soon after it was published in 1859.

===The Book of the Machines===
Butler developed the three chapters of ''Erewhon'' that make up "The Book of the Machines" from a number of articles that he had contributed to ''[[The Press]]'', which had just begun publication in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, beginning with "[[Darwin among the Machines]]" (1863). Butler was the first to write about the possibility that [[Artificial consciousness|machines might develop consciousness]] by [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian selection]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6173 "Darwin among the Machines"], reprinted in the Notebooks of Samuel Butler at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many dismissed this as a joke; but, in his preface to the second edition, Butler wrote, "I regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin's theory to an absurdity. Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin."

===Characters===
* Higgs—The narrator who informs the reader of the nature of Erewhonian society.
* Chowbok (Kahabuka)—Higgs' guide into the mountains; he is a native who greatly fears the Erewhonians. He eventually abandons Higgs.
* Yram—The daughter of Higgs' jailer who takes care of him when he first enters Erewhon. Her name is Mary spelled backwards.
* Senoj Nosnibor—Higgs' host after he is released from prison; he hopes that Higgs will marry his elder daughter. His name is Robinson Jones backwards.
* Zulora—Senoj Nosnibor's elder daughter—Higgs finds her unpleasant, but her father hopes Higgs will marry her. Her name is Aroluz backwards.
* Arowhena—Senoj Nosnibor's younger daughter; she falls in love with Higgs and runs away with him.
* Mahaina—A woman who claims to suffer from alcoholism but is believed to have a weak temperament.
* Ydgrun—The incomprehensible goddess of the Erewhonians. Her name is an anagram of Grundy (from [[Mrs. Grundy]], a character in [[Thomas Morton (playwright)|Thomas Morton]]'s play ''[[Speed the Plough]]'').

==Reception==
After its first release, this book sold far better than any of Butler's other works,{{clarify|date=February 2013}} perhaps because the British public assumed that the anonymous author was some better-known figure{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} (the favourite being [[Lord Lytton]], who had published ''[[The Coming Race]]'' two years previously). In a 1945 broadcast, [[George Orwell]] praised the book and said that when Butler wrote ''Erewhon'' it needed "imagination of a very high order to see that machinery could be dangerous as well as useful." He recommended the novel, though not its sequel, ''[[Erewhon Revisited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Collected Works, I Belong to the Left, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
The French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] used ideas from Butler's book at various points in the development of his philosophy of difference. In ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968), Deleuze refers to what he calls "Ideas" as "Erewhon". "Ideas are not concepts", he argues, but rather "a form of eternally positive differential [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]], distinguished from the identity of concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1968, p. 288).&lt;/ref&gt; "Erewhon" refers to the "nomadic distributions" that pertain to [[Simulacrum|simulacra]], which "are not [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] like the [[Category (Kant)|categories]], nor are they the ''hic et nunc'' or ''nowhere'', the diversity to which categories apply in representation."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1968, p. 285).&lt;/ref&gt; "Erewhon", in this reading, is "not only a disguised ''no-where'' but a rearranged ''now-here''."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1968, p. 333, n.7).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his collaboration with [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), Deleuze draws on Butler's "The Book of the Machines" to "go beyond" the "usual polemic between [[vitalism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]" as it relates to their concept of "[[Desiring-production|desiring-machines]]":&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1972, pp. 312–314).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For one thing, Butler is not content to say that machines extend the [[organism]], but asserts that they are really limbs and organs lying on the [[body without organs]] of a society, which men will appropriate according to their power and their wealth, and whose poverty deprives them as if they were mutilated organisms. For another, he is not content to say that organisms are machines, but asserts that they contain such an abundance of parts that they must be compared to very different parts of distinct machines, each relating to the others, engendered in combination with the others ... He shatters the vitalist argument by calling in question the specific or personal unity of the organism, and the mechanist argument even more decisively, by calling in question the structural unity of the machine.|[[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]]|''[[Anti-Œdipus]]''}}

In 1994, a group of ex-[[Yugoslavia]]n writers in [[Amsterdam]], who had established the [[International PEN|PEN centre of Yugoslav Writers in Exile]], published a single issue of a literary journal ''Erewhon''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.biblio.com/slobodan-et-al-blagojevic/erewhon~1189370~title Erewhon]''; Blagojevic, Slobodan, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand sound art organisation, the Audio Foundation, published in 2012 an anthology edited by [[Bruce Russell (musician)|Bruce Russell]] named ''Erewhon Calling'' after Butler's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Craig|title=Crooked Sounds from Aotearoa 'Erewhon Calling: Experimental Sound in New Zealand|url=https://www.popmatters.com/163769-erewhon-calling-experimental-sound-in-new-zealand-bruce-russell-edit-2495811032.html|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[New Zealand]] artist [[Gavin Hipkins]] released his first feature film, titled ''Erewhon'' and based on Butler's book. It premiered at the [[New Zealand International Film Festival]] and the [[Edinburgh Art Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of 'Erewhon'|url=http://www.circuit.org.nz/blog/circuit-cast-episode-14-gavin-hipkins-kim-paton-spark-festival|website=CIRCUIT|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Smile (Doctor Who)|Smile]]", the second episode of the 2017 season of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Doctor and Bill explore a spaceship named ''Erehwon''. Despite the slightly different spelling, the episode writer [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]] confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/frankcottrell_b/status/855857616358166528|title=Frank Cottrell-Boyce on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this was a reference to Butler's novel.

'''European Culture and Economy''', shortened as '''ECUE''', is an interdisciplinary postgraduate program that is distinct from [[European studies|European Studies]]. Both focus on European politics and developments. After receiving the academic degree [[Master of Arts]], graduates of ECUE may engage in various business fields, however, especially [[European Union|EU]]-related professions are targeted.

==History==
The [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany is currently the only university to offer European Culture and Economy as a path of study.&lt;ref&gt;http://studieren.de/hochschule.0.html?&amp;tx_assearchengine_pi2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small branch, approximately 30 students are accepted each year. It was first introduced in the winter term of 1999/2000 and has since become an established [[Master's degree|Masters]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;programme. Initially, ECUE was a way of giving arts scholars a fundamental understanding of economics, politics and intercultural competences. In its early stages, the program was supported financially by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) as well as [[German Rectors' Conference]] (HRK).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordrheinwestfalendirekt.de/broschuerenservice/download/173/auslandserfahrung.pdf p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, its level of quality was confirmed by ACQUIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&amp;titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&amp;standort=&amp;hochschule=&amp;sonstiger_hochschulname=&amp;fachausschuesse=&lt;/ref&gt; a German Quality Assurance Institute. Students of ECUE are intended to qualify as ''specialized generalist'' and be prepared for careers in international companies and institutions. The expected duration of study is four terms.

==Curriculum==
The curriculum puts an emphasis on examining the European area from an economic, cultural, political and sociological perspective. During Colloquia and an obligatory excursion (to Brussels), the interrelations of the disciplines are linked and investigated. Additionally, the students' intercultural competences and research methods are trained.

Seminars of the following disciplines are included in the program:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecue/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Law]]

The interdisciplinary and intercultural approach teaches students to analyze European topics from a cultural, economical and political angle. Next to interdisciplinary, ECUE stresses international relations. Many of the available places are assigned to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch Europa in NRW (p. 59,60)&lt;/ref&gt; So far, students of 30 different nations (Africa, U.S.A., Asia, many European countries) were able to successfully complete the program.

==Admission==
To be granted admission to the program, a very good to excellent [[Bachelor's degree]] is required. Furthermore, students must possess a good proficiency in the teaching languages, English and German.
Further, a term abroad or an internship are possible ways to organize the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion''', briefly '''ESPON''', is a European funded programme under the objective of "European Territorial Cooperation" of the Cohesion Policy of the European Union. It is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund - [[Interreg]]. 

The mission of the programme is to support policy development in relation to the aim of territorial cohesion and a harmonious development of the [[Europe]]an territory. Firstly it provides comparable information, evidence, analyses and scenarios on territorial dynamics and secondly it reveals territorial capital and potentials for the development of regions and larger territories thus contributing to European competitiveness, territorial cooperation and a sustainable and balanced development.

The current ESPON 2020 Programme is carried through by 28 [[European Union]] Member States as well as [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20240">'''Fordism''' is the basis of [[modernity|modern]] economic and social systems in industrialized, standardized [[mass production]] and [[mass consumption]]. The concept is named for [[Henry Ford]]. It is used in [[social theory|social]], [[economic theory|economic]], and [[management theory]] about [[economic production|production]], [[working conditions]], [[economic consumption|consumption]], and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~fthompso/MgmtCon/Fordism_&amp;_Postfordism.html |title=Fordism &amp; Postfordism |publisher=www.willamette.edu |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006). Give Me Liberty!: An American History. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''Après-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

'''Forensic materials engineering''', a branch of [[forensic engineering]], focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined by the nature of the material in question, be it [[metal]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]] or [[composite material|composite]]. An important aspect is the analysis of [[trace evidence]] such as [[skid mark]]s on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of [[fractography]].

Metal and alloy surfaces can be analyzed in a number of ways, including by [[spectroscopy]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] used during [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The nature and composition of the metal can normally be established by sectioning and polishing the bulk, and examining the flat section using [[optical microscopy]] after [[etching]] solutions have been used to provide contrast in the section between alloy constituents. Such solutions (often an [[acid]]) attack the surface preferentially, so isolating features or inclusions of one composition, enabling them to be seen much more clearly than in the polished but untreated surface. [[Metallography]] is a routine technique for examining the [[microstructure]] of metals, but can also be applied to ceramics, glasses and polymers. [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] can often be critical in  determining failures modes by examining fracture surfaces. The origin of a crack can be found and the way it grew assessed, to distinguish, for example, [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|overload]] failure from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Often however, fatigue fractures are easy to distinguish from overload failures by the lack of ductility, and the existence of a fast crack growth region and the slow crack growth area on the fracture surface. [[Crankshaft]] fatigue for example is a common failure mode for engine parts. The example shows just two such zones, the slow crack at the base, the fast at the top.

==Ceramics and glasses==
[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|left|thumb|200px| Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
Hard products like [[ceramic]] pottery and [[glass]] [[windscreen]]s can be studied using the same [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] methods used for metals, especially [[ESEM]] conducted at low vacuum. Fracture surfaces are especially valuable sources of information because surface features like hachures can enable the origin or origins of the cracks to be found. Analysis of the surface features is carried out using [[fractography]].

The position of the origin can then be matched with likely loads on the product to show how an accident occurred, for example. Inspection of bullet holes can often show the direction of travel and energy of the impact, and the way common glass products like bottles can be analysed to show whether deliberately or accidentally broken in a crime or accident. Defects such as foreign particles will often occur near or at the origin of the critical crack, and can be readily identified by [[ESEM]].

==Polymers and composites==
[[Image:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[chlorine]] attack of [[acetal resin]] plumbing joint]]
[[Thermoplastics]], [[thermosets]], and [[Composite material|composites]] can be analyzed using [[FTIR]] and [[UV spectroscopy]] as well as [[NMR]] and [[ESEM]]. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using [[microtomy]] from the solid product. The slicing method is preferable since there are no complications from solvent absorption, and the integrity of the sample is partly preserved. Fractured products can be examined using [[fractography]], an especially useful method for all fractured components using [[macrophotography]] and [[optical microscopy]]. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like [[chlorine]], present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the [[injection moulding]]s are faulty.

[[ESEM]] is especially useful for providing [[elemental analysis]] from viewed parts of the sample being investigated. It is effectively a technique of [[microanalysis]] and valuable for examination of [[trace evidence]]. On the other hand, colour rendition is absent, and there is no information provided about the way in which those elements are bonded to one another. Specimens will be exposed to a vacuum, so any volatiles may be removed, and surfaces may be contaminated by substances used to attach the sample to the mount.

==Elastomers==
[[Image:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ozone cracking in [[Natural rubber]] tubing]]
Rubber products are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents or loss of function. Failed products can be examined with many of the generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is [[vulcanized]] or [[cross-linked]]. [[Attenuated total reflectance]] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the [[selenium]] crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific [[elastomer]] used in a product. Often the best technique is [[ESEM]] using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides [[elemental analysis]], it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of [[chlorine]] indicates [[polychloroprene]] while the presence of [[nitrogen]] indicates [[nitrile rubber]]. The method is also useful in confirming [[ozone cracking]] by the large amounts of [[oxygen]] present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]] and associated [[copolymer]]s. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during [[ozonolysis]].

The problem occurs when small concentrations of [[ozone]] gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as [[O-ring]]s and [[diaphragm seal]]s. The product must be in tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.

The '''German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (GPIA), Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute''', founded in 1900 is one of the most important biblical archaeological institutes in the Near East. Its [[German language|German]] name is ''Deutsches Evangelisches Institut für Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes''.

== Institutes ==
The German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute, operates in two locations – [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. Its high reputation as cultural institution, help desk, and meeting place for European scholars makes it a sought-after partner for cooperation between German and international organizations and projects. The GPIA is a foundation administered by the [[German Protestant Church]]. At the same time, it serves as a research unit of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI). They cooperate in several archaeological projects.

* Institute [[Jerusalem]],
Director-General: Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. h.c. [[Dieter Vieweger]]&lt;br /&gt;
Address: Auguste-Victoria-Compound, P.O.Box 18 463, Jerusalem 91184&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological museum

* Institute [[Amman]],
Director: Dr. Jutta Häser&lt;br /&gt;
Address: P.O.Box 183, Amman 11118, Jordan&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological collection

== Aims ==
The mission of the institute was clearly stated in its founding charter: the exploration of the Holy Land and its diverse past, cultures and religions. The knowledge acquired was meant to be available to, and discussed by, both experts and the general public. In light of this founding mission, the institute undertakes research on the history and culture of the region. To this end, the institute conducts its own excavations and supports other German research projects.

The institute is also committed to disseminating the results of research, especially in the areas of archaeology, cultural studies, theology and the Church. For this purpose, the institute maintains a research library, issues its own archaeological journal and organises meetings, lecture series and exhibitions. Especially important is the Course Programme for theologians, which was founded over 100 years ago by the first director, [[Gustaf Dalman]]. The institute also tries to make archaeological knowledge available to the public by offering guided tours of Jerusalem and the surrounding area.

The GPIA fosters close relations with the cultural institutions in the host countries and supports scientific research without any political or religious borders on both sides of the river Jordan.

== Archaeological projects ==

=== Tall Zira'a and the Gadara Region Project (Jordan) ===
Together with the [[Biblical Archaeological Institute]] in [[Wuppertal]], the GPIA conducts the [[Gadara Region Project]] (2001–2020) in the Wadi al-'Arab, south of Umm Qais. The central archaeological site of the Wadi al-'Arab is the [[Tall Zira'a]].
There is hardly an area of Palestine where its history can be studied in such a concentrated manner as in the Wadi al-'Arab. This deep valley, which lies roughly five kilometres south-west of the ancient [[Decapolis]] city of Gadara (today [[Umm Qais]]), is, in many ways, an archaeological bonanza due to the variety in what it has to offer. A number of springs, fertile soils and a moderate climate all provide for excellent living conditions, and the most imposing hill in the valley, Tall Zira'a, possesses its own artesian spring and the very best potential for settlement.

In addition, an important trade route ran through the wadi which once linked Egypt with Mesopotamia. The economic success and industriousness of the wadi's inhabitants have left plenty of traces over the millennia. Over one hundred sites mark out the distinguished history of human settlement in the region from the advent of sedentism to the Islamic period. Settlements, canals, water mills, cisterns, oil presses, wine presses, watch towers, graves and, above all, Tall Zira'a with its over 5000 years of settlement activity.

=== The archaeological park below the Church of the Redeemer (Jerusalem) ===
The archaeological park opened in November 2012 "The Times", located below the nave of the Church of the Redeemer was co-developed by German Protestant Institute (GPIA) and offers the possibility to commit more than 2000 years of history of the city of Jerusalem by walking through it.

The archaeological excavations, conducted by [[Conrad Schick]] 1893 und Ute Wagner-Lux (the former director of GPIA) respectively Karl Vriezen 1970–1974, have been prepared by the German Protestant Institute in the Holy Land in 2009–2012 to present visitors the different stages of development and building of Jerusalem.

=== Former projects ===
* Ute Wagner-Lux – [[Madaba]] / [[Jerusalem]] / [[Gadara]],
* August Strobel – Kallirrhoë (En ez-Zara),
* Gunnar Lehmann; Martin Peilstöcker – Plain of [[Akko]],
* Volkmar Fritz – Tell el-Oreme,
* Susanne Kerner – [[Gadara Aqueduct|Gadara Tunnel System]]
* Thomas Weber – Gadara
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger – Esh-Shallaf near Irbid,
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger; Roland Lamprichs – Baja near [[Petra]],
* Roland Lamprichs – Tall Johfieh,
* Michael Heinzelmann – [[Hippos]].

==History==
The GPIA was founded on June 19, 1900, by the Deutsche Evangelische Kirchenkonferenz in Eisenach in order to "maintain, further and regulate the relations between the holy places of biblical history, on the one hand, and between the scientific inquiry and the interests of the Christian faith of the Protestant Church, on the other, in the fields of biblical and ecclesiastical archaeology."

Gustaf Dalman – then Professor of Old Testament and Judaic Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] – was appointed first director and built up the Jerusalem institute. The changed situation after the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 necessitated the establishment of the Amman institute. In 1982, the institute in Jerusalem moved to new buildings at the Auguste-Victoria-Compound on the [[Mount of Olives]].

{{Chinese|t=[[wikt:工尺譜|工尺譜]]|s=[[wikt:工尺谱|工尺谱]]|p=gōng chě&lt;!--not chǐ--&gt; pǔ|j=gung1 ce1 pou2}} 
'''''Gongche'' notation''' or '''''gongchepu''''' is a traditional [[musical notation]] method, once popular in ancient [[China]]. It uses [[Chinese character]]s to represent [[musical note]]s. It was named after two of the Chinese characters that were used to represent musical notes, namely "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:工|工]]}}" ''gōng'' and "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:尺|尺]]}}" ''chě''. Since the pronunciation ''chě'' for the character "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is uncommon, many people call it '''''gongchi'' notation''' or '''''gongchipu''''' by mistake{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

[[Sheet music]] written in this notation is still used for [[traditional Chinese musical instruments]] and [[Chinese opera]]s. However the notation is becoming less popular, replaced by mostly ''jianpu'' ([[numbered musical notation]]) and sometimes the standard western notation.

== The notes ==

=== Basic characters ===

The notation usually uses a [[Solfege#Variations|movable "do"]] system. There are variations of the character set used for musical notes. A commonly accepted set is shown below with its relation to ''jianpu'' and [[solfege]].

|}

=== Usual variations ===

The three notes just below the central octave are usually represented by special characters:
:{| class="wikitable" align="center" 
|- align="center"
!''Gongche''
|width="22%"|{{lang|zh|合}}&lt;br&gt;''hé''
|width="22%"|{{lang|zh|四}}&lt;br&gt;''sì''

!Solfege
|sol||la||(between ti♭ and ti)
|- align="center"
!Simplified Japanese notation
|{{lang|ja|ㄙ}}||{{lang|ja|マ}}||{{lang|ja|ㄧ}}
|}
Sometimes "{{lang|zh|士}}" ''shì'' is used instead of "{{lang|zh|四}}" ''sì''. Sometimes "{{lang|zh|一}}" ''yī'' is not used, or its role is exchanged with "{{lang|zh|乙}}" ''yǐ''.

To represent other notes in different [[octave]]s, traditions differ among themselves. For ''[[Kunqu]]'', the end strokes of "{{lang|zh|上}}" "{{lang|zh|尺}}" "{{lang|zh|工}}" "{{lang|zh|凡}}" are extended by a tiny slash downward for the lower octave, a [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] "{{lang|zh|亻}}" is added for one octave higher than the central. For [[Cantonese opera]], however, "{{lang|zh|亻}}" means an octave lower, while "{{lang|zh|彳}}" means an octave higher.

Some other variations:
* "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|乂}}" in Taiwanese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|凡}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|反}}" in Cantonese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|彳上}}", the "do" just above the central octave, is usually replaced by "{{lang|zh|生}}" in Cantonese tradition.

=== Pronunciation ===

When the notes are sung in different opera traditions, they do not sound as the words would be pronounced in the respective [[varieties of Chinese|regional dialects]]. Instead, they are pronounced in an approximation of [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Rhythm ==

[[Image:Kungchepo_old_mcdonald.png|left|thumb|250px|An example of ''gongche'' notation]]

''Gongche'' notation does not mark the relative length of the notes. Instead, marks for the [[percussion]], understood to be played at regular intervals, are written alongside with the notes. Gongche is written in the same format as how Chinese was traditionally written; from top to bottom and then from right to left. The rhythm marks are written to the right of the note characters.

The diagram at the left illustrates how the tune "Old McDonald Had a Farm" will look like if written in ''gongche'' notation. Here, "{{lang|zh|。}}" denotes the stronger beat, called "{{lang|zh|板}}" ''bǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|拍}}" ''pāi'', and "{{lang|zh|、}}" denotes the weaker beat, called "{{lang|zh|眼}}" ''yǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|撩}}" ''liáo''. In effect, there is one beat in every two notes, i.e. two notes are sung or played to each beat. These notes in solfege with markings will show a similar effect:
:'''do''' do &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; sol '''la''' la &lt;u&gt;sol&lt;/u&gt; &amp;nbsp; '''mi''' mi &lt;u&gt;re&lt;/u&gt; re '''do'''

[[File:Kam Hok Yap Mun-Yeung Kwan Sam Tip.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Example of gongche use with [[guqin]] tablature and beat marks.]]

Using this method, only the number of notes within a beat can be specified. The actual length of each note is up to tradition and the interpretation of the artist.

Notice that the actual rhythm marks used differ among various traditions.

== History and usage ==

''Gongche'' notation was invented in the [[Tang Dynasty]]. It became popular in the [[Song Dynasty]]. It is believed to have begun as a [[tablature]] of certain musical instrument, possibly using a fixed "do" system. Later it became a popular pitch notation, typically using a movable "do" system.

The notation is not accurate in modern sense. It provides a musical skeleton, allowing an artist to improvise. The details are usually passed on by oral tradition. However, once a tradition is lost, it is very difficult to reconstruct how the music was supposed to sound. Variations among different traditions increased the difficulty in learning the notation.

The system was also introduced to Korea (where it is referred to as ''gong jeok bo'') in ancient times and many traditional musicians still learn their music from such scores (although they typically perform from memory).

''[[Kunkunshi]]'', a [[Okinawan music|Ryukyuan]] musical notation still in use for [[sanshin]], was directly influenced by Gongche.&lt;ref&gt;East Asia: China, Japan, and Korea (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music). 2001. page 828&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

==Career==
In 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar.&lt;ref name=toi14/&gt;&lt;ref name="SuccessStories"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.successstories.co.in/incredible-story-of-persistence-and-devotion-jadav-payeng-single-Handedly-converts-a-sandbar-into-a-prosperous-1360-acre-forest/ | title=Incredible story of Persistence and Devotion: Jadav Payeng Single-handedly Converts a Sandbar into a Prosperous 1,360-acre Forest | publisher=[[Success Stories]] | accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started working on the forest in 19  A.D.when the social forestry division of [[Golaghat district]] launched a scheme of tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from Kokilamukh in [[Jorhat district]]. Molai was one of the labourers who worked In that project which was completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the project even after other workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued to plant more trees on his own, in an effort to transform the area into a forest.

The forest, which came to be known as Molai forest, now houses [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[Indian rhinoceros]], and over 100 deer and rabbits. Molai forest is also Home to monkeys and several varieties of birds, Including a large number of vultures.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; There are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (''[[Terminalia arjuna]]''), ejar (''[[Lagerstroemia speciosa]]''), goldmohur (''[[Delonix regia]]''), koroi (''[[Albizia procera]]''), moj (''[[Archidendron bigeminum]]'') and himolu (''[[Bombax ceiba]]''). Bamboo covers an area of over 300 hectares.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.asianage.com/india/man-creates-forest-single-handedly-brahmaputra-sand-bar-972 | title=Man creates forest single-handedly on Brahmaputra sand bar | publisher=[[The Asian Age]] | accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stay for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest in recent years.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

His efforts became known to the authorities in 2008, when forest department officials went to the area in search of a herd of 115 elephants that had retreated into the forest after damaging property in the village of Aruna Chapori, which is about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from the forest. The officials were surprised to see such a large and dense forest and since then the department has regularly visited the site.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

In 2013, poachers tried to kill the rhinos staying in the forest but failed in their attempt due to Molai who alerted department officials. Officials promptly seized various articles used by the poachers to trap the animals.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

Molai is ready to manage the forest in a better way and to go to other places of the state to start a similar venture. Now his aim is to spread his forest to another sand bar inside of Brahmaputra.&lt;ref name="ajithkumar.cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajithkumar.cc/my-thoughts/one-of-the-greatest-achievements-of-the-human-race-jadav-payeng/ |title=One of the Greatest Achievements of the Human Race – Jadav Payeng |publisher=Ajith Kumar.

==Personal life==
Jadav Payeng belongs to a tribe called "[[Mising people|Mising]]" in Assam, India. He lives in a small hut in the forest. Binita, his wife, and his 3 children (two sons and a daughter) accompany him.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; He has cattle and buffalo on his farm and sells the milk for his livelihood, which is his only source of income.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; In an interview from 2012, he revealed that he has lost around 100 of his cows and buffaloes to the tigers in the forest, but blames the people who carry out large scale encroachment and destruction of forests as the root cause of the plight of wild animals.&lt;ref name="ajithkumar.cc"/&gt;

'''John Gray''' (born December 28, 1951) is an American relationship counselor, lecturer and author. In 1969, he began a nine-year association with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] before beginning his career as an author and personal relationship counselor. In 1992 he published the book ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'', which became a long term best seller and formed the central theme of all his subsequent books and career activities. His books have sold millions of copies.

==Early life and education==
Gray was born in [[Houston]], Texas, in 1951 to a father who was an oil executive and a mother who worked at a spiritual bookshop,&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MonkQuote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmarsvenus.com/dr-john-gray.php|title=John Gray: Biography of John Gray|website=www.askmarsvenus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up with five brothers.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Beaumont-Thomas |first=Ben |title=Interview to John Gray.

===Other ventures===
In 1996, Gray and Maia and Bart Berens co-founded Mars Venus Institute. Bart Berens was president and Maia Berens was director.

In 1997, Gray began opening Mars &amp; Venus Counseling Centers, where he trains therapists in his "Mars &amp; Venus technique" in exchange for a one time licensing fee and monthly "royalty payments". [[Dorothy Cantor]], a former president of the [[American Psychological Association]], has questioned the ethics of creating a franchise for what is essentially a therapeutic process.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===Interviews and appearances===
Gray has made numerous media appearances including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'',&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ''[[Larry King Live]].'' Gray has been profiled in ''[[Newsweek]], People'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Premier Speakers web site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AOL Coaches web site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coaches.aol.com/love-and-sex/john-gray/main/biography|title=Healthy Living|website=coaches.aol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=January 2011}}

In a June 2014 interview with [[Agence France-Presse]], Gray was quoted as saying with regard to [[feminism]], "The reason why there's so much divorce is that feminism promotes independence in women. I'm very happy for women to find greater independence, but when you go too far in that direction, then who's at home?"&lt;ref name=2014AFPInterview&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |title='Mars, Venus' author warns over sex in online world |url=http://www.afp.com/en/node/2470223 |website=[[AFP.com]] |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]] |accessdate=9 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140609181028/http://www.afp.com/en/node/2470223 |archivedate=June 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "feminism in America holds back sales of [his] books", while other parts of the world - he cited Australia and Latin America notably - are more in tune with his basic message.&lt;ref name=2014NZHerald&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Feminism and free porn are ruining relationships - author|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11268800|website=nzherald.co.nz|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[online pornography]] Gray stated, "With free internet porn, there's a massive addiction happening," adding that there are "just millions and millions of people... experiencing their sexual satisfactions through total fantasy. The effect that porn has on the brain is like taking heroin." With regard to the rise of infidelity sites like [[Ashley Madison]] and [[Arrangement Finders]] he states, "When you have impersonal sex.... 'It's OK, here are these cheating wives, men, they want to have sex with you'... So you go have sex with someone that you don't know and someone you don't love... impersonal sex does promote addiction to sex," he adds, "it's along the same line of pornography."&lt;ref name=2014AFPInterview/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014AVNGrayInterviews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title='Men Are From Mars' Author Blames Free Online Porn, Feminists|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Men-Are-From-Mars-Author-Blames-Free-Online-Porn-Feminists-563972.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2002, author [[Julia T. Wood]] published a critical response to Gray's portrayals of men and women as he portrayed them in his book ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Julia T. |authorlink=Julia Wood |title=A Critical Response to John Gray's Mars and Venus Portrayals of Men and Women |journal=Southern Communication Journal |location=[[Memphis, Tennessee]] |volume=67 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2002 |pages=201–210 |doi=10.1080/10417940209373229 |oclc=936904728}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]] published a book-length critique of Gray and other self-help ventures premised on gender difference stereotypes in ''[[The Myth of Mars and Venus|The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Deborah. The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages? Oxford University Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray was accused of borrowing from the work of author [[Deborah Tannen]] and he acknowledges some similarities but says, "I was teaching those ideas before I'd heard of her" and that he did not read her book.&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with HarperCollins editor Nancy Peske, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have accused Gray of limiting human psychology to [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/feb/14/20020214-035728-1618r/ |title=Mars and Venus at work; Critics aim to bring Gray back down to Earth |last=Murphy |first=Lauren |date=February 14, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |accessdate=January 7, 2014}} = [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83549879.html ''Mars and Venus at work; Critics aim to bring Gray back down to Earth''].

'''''Karius and Bactus''''' ({{ISBN|0961539410}}) ({{lang-no|Karius og Baktus}} is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[children's novel]] written and illustrated by [[Thorbjørn Egner]]. The book was first published in 1949 and produced as a 15-minute [[animatronics|puppet animation film]] by [[Ivo Caprino]] in 1954. An English translation by Mike Sevig and Turi Olderheim was published in the United States in 1986.

The main characters are Karius (black haired) and Bactus (red haired). Their names are puns on [[Caries]] and [[Bacteria]], and they are two small "[[tooth troll]]s" that live inside cavities in the teeth of a boy named [[Jens (given name)|Jens]]. They have a very good life, especially when Jens eats [[white bread]] with [[syrup]] and fails to [[Toothbrush|brush his teeth]] afterwards. Eventually their homes are destroyed by the work of a [[dentist]] and they are rinsed out of Jens' mouth through proper [[Dentistry|dental care]].

The story of Karius and Bactus, with its humorous illustrations and important message, has become a classic of Norwegian children's literature. Since its publication, the idea of "tooth trolls" has been used as a pedagogical device for generations of Scandinavian children.

A '''Kunstgewerbeschule''' (English: ''School of arts and crafts'' or ''school of applied arts'') was a type of vocational arts school that existed in German-speaking countries from the mid-19th century. The term '''Werkkunstschule''' was also used for these schools. From the 1920s and after [[World War II]], most of them either merged into universities or closed, although some continued until the 1970s.

Students generally started at these schools from the ages of 16 to 20 years old, although sometimes as young as 14, and undertook a four-year course, in which they were given a general education and also learnt specific arts and craft skills such as weaving, metalwork, painting, sculpting, etc.

Some of the most well known artists of the period had been Kunstgewerbeschule students, including [[Anni Albers]], [[Peter Behrens]], [[René Burri]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Horst P. Horst]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Oskar Schlemmer]]. Many students accepted into the renowned [[Bauhaus]] art school had previously studied at Kunstgewerbeschulen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.com/the-bauhaus/people/students/ Bauhaus Archiv.Bauhaus100.Students].

==List of Kunstgewerbeschulen (selected)==
In order of date opened:

*[[Berlin]] (1868). Berlin had two schools of applied art. The teaching institute of the [[Berlin Museum of Applied Arts]], (German: [[:de:Unterrichtsanstalt des Kunstgewerbemuseums Berlin]]), opened on 12 January 1868. The museum itself was founded in 1866 as an initiative of a private museum association. The school was set up to provide an alternative to academic arts training. From 1881 the school was based in the museum's [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]] building in Niederkirchnerstraße in [[Kreuzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Das Kunstgewerbe-Museum zu Berlin: Festschrift zur Eröffnung des Museumsgebäudes''. Berlin: Reichsdruckerei, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 the Prussian state took over the ''Kunstgewerbemuseum'' and its affiliated school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.udk-berlin.de/universitaet/die-geschichte-der-universitaet-der-kuenste-berlin/die-vorgaengerinstitutionen-von-1696-bis-1975/vorgaengerinstitutionen-bildende-kunst-und-gestaltung/unterrichtsanstalt-des-kunstgewerbemuseums-1868-1924/ UDK-Berlin.

It is one of the predecessors of the ''Hochschule der Künste Berlin'' which was founded in 1975, and which since 2001 has been the ''Universität der Künste Berlin (UdK)'' ([[Berlin University of the Arts]]). The other Berlin ''Kunstgewerbeschule'', founded in 1899, was also integrated into what is now UdK, see below.&lt;ref name="UDK"&gt;[https://www.udk-berlin.de/universitaet/die-geschichte-der-universitaet-der-kuenste-berlin/die-vorgaengerinstitutionen-von-1696-bis-1975/ UDK-Berlin.

A '''music school''' is an educational [[institution]] specialized in the study, training, and research of music. Such an institution can also be known as a '''school of music''', '''music academy''', '''music faculty''', '''college of music''', '''music department''' (of a larger institution), '''conservatory''' or '''conservatoire'''. Instruction consists of training in the performance of [[musical instruments]], singing, [[musical composition]], conducting,  [[musicianship]], as well as academic and research fields such as [[musicology]], [[music history]] and [[music theory]].

[[Music instruction]] can be provided within the compulsory general education system, or within specialized children's music schools such as the [[Purcell School]]. Elementary-school children can access music instruction also in after-school institutions such as music academies or music schools. In Venezuela [[El Sistema]] of youth orchestras provides free after-school instrumental instruction through music schools called ''núcleos''.
The term “music school” can also be applied to institutions of higher education under names such as ''school of music'', such as the [[Jacobs School of Music]] of Indiana University; ''music academy'', like the [[Sibelius Academy]] or the [[Royal Academy of Music]], London; ''music faculty'' as the Don Wright Faculty of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]]; ''college of music'', characterized by the [[Royal College of Music]]  and the [[Berklee College of Music]]; ''music department'', like the Department of Music at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; or the term ''conservatory'', exemplified by the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In other parts of Europe, the equivalents of ''higher school of music'' or ''university of music'' may be used, such as the [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] (Cologne University of Music).

==History==
[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Based around the Notre Dame Cathedral, the [[Notre Dame School]] was an important centre of polyphonic music.]]
Although music and music education may have been in existence for thousands of years, the earliest history is speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover The origins of music Nils Lennart Wallin, Steven Brown, Björn Merker] {{ISBN|0-262-73143-6}} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even when history starts to be recorded, music is mentioned more frequently than music education. Within the biblical tradition, Hebrew litany was accompanied with rich music, but the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch was silent on the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. However, by [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 10, Alfred Sendrey suggests that we find “a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.” This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel]] was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html Lee Krähenbühl: A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[schola cantorum (papal choir)]] in Rome may be the first recorded music school in history, when [[Gregory the Great]] (540–604) made permanent an existing guild dating from the 4th century (''schola'' originally referred more to a guild rather than school).

[[Saint Martial school]], 10th to 12th century, was an important school of composition at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial]], [[Limoges]]. It is known for the composition of [[trope (music)|trope]]s, [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s, and early [[organum]]. In this respect, it was an important precursor to the [[Notre Dame School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA748&amp;lpg=PA748&amp;dq=Saint+Martial+school+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1HwZru3T3e&amp;sig=OyZMEyDOXAnc-fTxwfjhFKfO-T4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1E7YTLGkMZOKhQfMwP32Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Martial%20school%20music&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music: St Martial school] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Notre Dame school (late 12th and early 13th century) which was the earliest repertory of [[polyphonic]] (multipart) music to gain international prestige and circulation.

The [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (National Academy of St Cecilia) is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world, based in Italy.
It is based at the Auditorium [[Parco della Musica]] in [[Rome]], and was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, for whom the Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.
It was founded as a "congregation" or "confraternity" – a religious guild, so to speak – and over the centuries, has grown from a forum for local musicians and composers to an internationally acclaimed academy active in music scholarship (with 100 prominent music scholars forming the body of the Accademia) to music education (in its role as a conservatory) to performance (with an active choir and symphony orchestra).

The term ''conservatory'' has its origin in 16th-century [[Renaissance]] Italy, where orphanages (''[[wikt:conservatorio|conservatori]]'') were attached to hospitals. The orphans (''conservati'' ‘saved’) were given a musical education there, and the term gradually applied to music schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|133512|Conservatory}}. Retrieved 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitals-conservatories were among the first secular institutions equipped for practical training in music. By the 18th century, Italian conservatories were already playing a major role in the training of artists and composers.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"&gt;''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Naples]], a ''conservatorio'' was strictly a secular place for teaching and learning specializing in music education. There were already four [[conservatories in Naples]] active in the 17th and 18th century: 
* ''I poveri di Gesù Cristo'' (‘The Paupers of Jesus Christ’), founded in 1599 by Marcello Fossataro, already included in their official record a ''magister musicæ'' and ''magister [[lyre|lyræ]]'' in 1633; 
* ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', where the composer [[Giovan Battista Pergolesi]] (1710–1736) studied; 
* ''La pietà dei turchini'' was founded in 1583 and the earliest findings suggest musical activity around the year 1615;
* ''Sant'Onofrio a porta Capuana'', where the composer [[Giovanni Paisiello]] (1740–1816) studied and then taught, started teaching music in the mid-1600 and in the following decades will give more priority to the [[opera buffa]];
* plus one only for girls called ''dell'Annunziata''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Della Corte, G. M. Gatti, ''Dizionario di musica'', Paravia, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in these very institutions that the so-called [[Neapolitan School|''Scuola Musicale Napoletana'']] was developed, thanks to the work of musicians and educators like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1660–1725) and [[Francesco Durante]] (1684–1755), who was also Pergolesi’s and Paisiello’s teacher.

It was the example set in Naples, where admission was by competitive examination and tuition was free, that was then copied, with modifications, in many European cities, including Paris (1795), Bologna (1804), Milan (1807), Florence and Prague (1811), Warsaw and Vienna (1821), London (1822), the Hague (1826), and Liege (1827). The second half of the 19th century saw the network expanding to the Americas, Rio de Janeiro (1847), Boston (1853), Baltimore and Chicago (1868), Havana (1885), and Buenos Aires (1893). Establishments for advanced training in music were organized in the 1940s in several Asian and African countries, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Kenya.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"/&gt;

To this extent, projects like [[El Sistema]] are more in line with the tradition set in Italy (where tuition at conservatories remains still free) than in an English-speaking country, where students have a very selective access to [[bursaries]] (see the [[Royal Academy of Music]] or the [[Royal College of Music]] in the UK).

==Primary and secondary education==

===Specialist music schools===
[[Image:Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere (Hauptansicht).jpg|thumb|260px|Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere is a specialist music school in Germany]]
Specialist music schools exist in many countries and whose purpose is to identify, and assist, children with exceptional potential, to benefit from world-class specialist training as part of a broad and balanced education, which will enable them, if they choose, to proceed towards self-sustaining careers in music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areteacademy.org/ Arete Music Academy] retrieved Aug 29th 2018&lt;/ref&gt; These schools may be formally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/ Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or informally attached to a conservatory.  Entry is typically between the ages of ages 8 and 18 and admission is through competitive audition.
Schools may be public or independent; where schools are independent, pupils may be in receipt of governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml English Aided Pupil Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226141532/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml |date=26 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private scholarships. Typically as students progress through the school the time spent on music increases and on academic subjects decrease. These schools usually teach only instrumentalists but may also include choristers.

Some schools (like conservatories) are broader and may cover the [[performing arts]]: music, drama, dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laguardiahs.org/home.html Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710011008/http://laguardiahs.org/home.html |date=10 July 2012 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music schools within schools===
Many music schools are located within existing schools. The pattern is quite diverse and may include:

Specialist music units in Scotland, where students are drawn from an area wider than the host schools catchment. Students will receive specialist music tuition within the music school but are fully integrated within the host school for other lessons. Entry to the specialist music unit or school is by competitive audition, which also effectively gives entry to the host school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicplockton.org/ Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public or independent schools contain ''music departments'', some of which achieve high standards. These are sometimes referred to as Music schools. ''Music Colleges'' in England are schools that get additional private and governmental money to specialise in music. Entry is to the host school and musical ability is not an admission requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music Guildford County School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033911/http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music |date=4 September 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Schools which perform highly may specialise in an additional area for example sports or technology.

===Pre-college divisions===
Many conservatories or other tertiary-level institutions have pre-college divisions or junior departments for children of school age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmnyc.edu/precollege/ Manhattan School of  Music Pre-college Division] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the curriculum includes individual lesson(s), orchestra, [[chamber music]], [[music theory|theory]], [[musicianship]], [[Musical composition|composition]] and [[music technology]]. Classes are usually held on a Saturday and children attend normal schools during the week.

===Music schools outwith the general education system===
Non-governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikschule-froehlich.de/index.php/ Musik Fröhlich] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ Yamaha Music Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231210029/http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ |date=31 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; schools of music offer music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20+ years. In general, students attend these schools weekend or evening. These schools are typically provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations.

==Tertiary education==

===Conservatory===

[[File:JacobsSchoolofMusic.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Jacobs School of Music]], part of [[Indiana University]], has more than 1,600 students]]
A conservatory of music may also be known in English as ''conservatoire'' (chiefly in England&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatoire}} ‘The French form of the word [...] is even sometimes assumed as the name of musical schools in England. In the U.S. the anglicized form ''conservatory'' is used.’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''conservatorium'' (in Australia&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition'': ‘''conservatorium'': (Austral.) the usual term for conservatoire’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster’s ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'': ‘Origin of ''conservatorium'': German ''Konservatorium''’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''academy'' or ''college''. Some schools or conservatories are exclusively focused on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ram.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Royal Academy of Music] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others have a wider focus, for example covering music, drama and dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/ Juilliard] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatories are suitable for students who wish to develop their performance, conducting, or composition to a professional standard. Typically, they offer a high percentage of practical training combined with academic study and professional development  for those considering a career in the creative arts. Individual teaching is the strength of most components.

Students have the opportunity to perform, conduct or have their music played on a regular basis, both informally and in public.
This may be solo or as part of an orchestra, ensemble or band. Typically, conservatories focus on Western classical music. However, some schools focus on traditional instruments for example [[Chinese instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccmusic.edu.cn/ywwz/index.htm China Conservatory] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Others may have departments for [[traditional music]] which includes both traditional and classical instruments, for example [[bagpipes]] alongside the [[fiddle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ Royal Scottish Academy for Music and Drama] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915045605/http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ |date=15 September 2012 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, students can focus on [[jazz]], [[world music]] or pop music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahk.nl/en/conservatorium Conservatorium van Amsterdam] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The time required to complete music degrees is generally not much different from degrees in other fields, i.e. 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree, 1–2 years for a [[Master of Music]] degree, and 3–5 years for a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] or [[Doctor of Music]] Degree. A PhD degree can be gained for areas such as [[musicology]], [[music theory]], [[music composition]], [[music education]], or [[music therapy]].  Some schools may offer a non-academic degree that is solely performance based, such as the (United States) A.D. or Artist Diploma; this may be offered at the undergraduate and/or graduate level.

===University schools of music===

[[File:The Kohl Building.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] shares its campus with [[Oberlin College]].]]
University music departments originally placed more emphasis on academic study of music, rather than performance. However, today, the division may not be so rigid, with many often placing greater emphasis on performance now than they did in the past. The specific balance of vocational training and academic study varies from one institution to another, and from one country to another.
Some countries separately define their institutions between university status and [[vocational university]] status, whilst other countries do not define such a rigid division. In addition to offering degrees similar to those offered at conservatories, some universities offer non-professional music-related degrees such as a Bachelor of Arts in Music or a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education. A number of previously independent conservatories have become affiliated to universities

[[File:BassoonKeys.png |thumb|right|200px|The modern [[bassoon]] was only feasible as an instrument when the mechanical technology for creating precise key mechanisms was developed. In the 2010s, flutes, clarinets and many other woodwind instruments use similar key mechanisms.]]
'''Mechanical music technology''' is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to [[musical composition|compose]], [[music notation|notate]], play back or [[sound recording|record]] songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ians developed stringed instruments, such as [[harp]]s, [[lyre]]s and [[lute]]s, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as [[double clarinet]]s and percussion instruments such as [[cymbals]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the [[horn (instrument)|horn]], pipe, lyre, harp, and [[bagpipe]]. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the [[Middle Ages]], hand-written [[music notation]] was developed to write down the notes of religious [[Plainchant]] melodies; this notation enabled the [[Catholic church]] to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire.

During the [[Renaissance music]] era, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the piano. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]] (1750–1820), [[Beethoven]] added new instruments to the orchestra to create new sounds, such as the [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]]s, and [[Bass drum|untuned percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]. During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of relatively inexpensive [[sheet music]], which amateur middle class music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as [[piston valve]]-equipped [[cornet]]s, saxophones, [[euphonium]]s, and [[Wagner tuba]]s were added to the orchestra. Many of the mechanical innovations developed for instruments in the 19th century, notably on the piano, brass and woodwinds continued to be used in the 20th and early 21st century.

[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|right|170px|"David with his harp", from the [[Paris Psalter]], c. 960, [[Constantinople]].]]

According to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. 
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miriam]] and women celebrate the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] with "timbrels" (small hand drums) (from the [[Tomić Psalter]]).]]In addition there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], wood flute, [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and early trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}} There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice.

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]]. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[hydraulis]]'' or "water organ". Note the curved trumpet, called the ''bukanē'' by the Greeks and, later, ''cornu'' by the Romans.]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:

*the [[lyre]]: a strummed and occasionally [[plucked string instrument]], essentially a hand-held [[zither]] built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song.
*the [[kithara]], also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the [[lyre]]. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the [[sounding box]] at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a [[plectrum]]. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.
* the ''[[aulos]]'', usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds.
* the [[Pan pipes]], also known as panflute and [[syrinx]] (Greek συριγξ), (so-called for the nymph who was changed into a reed in order to hide from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top).
* the [[hydraulis]], a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius &lt;ref&gt;''De Architectura'' x, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Heron of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatica'', I, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the [[Ancient Roman music|music of ancient Rome]].

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Musicians from Zliten mosaic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Musicians in a detail from the [[Zliten mosaic]] (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying [[gladiator]] combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the ''tuba'', ''hydraulis'' (water pipe organ), and two ''cornua'']]
The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. [[Roman art]] depicts various woodwinds, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], percussion and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

Roman instruments include:
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze trumpet with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] – αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''capistrum'' to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} 
*The ''[[askaules]]'' – a [[bagpipe]].
*Versions of the modern flute and [[panpipes]].
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}
* The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The ''hydraulis'' accompanied [[gladiator]] contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. 
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device called a [[scabellum]] used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and [[tambourine]]s.
*Drum and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. 
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of notation for the [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'', which originated in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi. ''Gregorian Chant''. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
During the [[Medieval Music]] era (476 to 1400) the [[plainchant]] tunes used by monks for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single melody line, with no harmony parts) and transmitted by oral tradition ("by ear"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to centralize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, which stretched from Europe to North Africa, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. So long as the church had to rely on teaching people chant melodies "by ear", it limited the number of people who could be taught. As well, when songs are learned by ear, variations and changes naturally slip in.

Various signs written above the chant texts, called ''[[neumes]]'' were introduced. These little signs indicated to the singer whether the melody went up in pitch or down in pitch. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was "heighted neumes", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval (e.g., a small interval like a tone or a large interval like a sixth) as well as the direction (up in pitch or down in pitch).

At first the little dots were just placed in the space about the words. However, this method made it hard to determine what pitch a song started on, or when a song was returning to the same pitch. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them, and being placed on or above the lines. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d' Arezzo]] (c. 1000–1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes. Singers were expected to be able to improvise the rhythm, using established traditions and norms.

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|140 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310–1320]]
Instruments used to perform medieval music include the early flute, which was made of wood and which did not have any metal keys or pads. Flutes of this era could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument; the wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the related instrument called the [[gemshorn]]; and the [[pan flute]]. Medieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.

The bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]] as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rabāb]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|(1990)|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to "bow" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jaw harp]] were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) existed in the medieval era.

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. One limiting factor to the wider dissemination of musical styles was that [[monk]]s, [[nuns]], [[aristocrat]]s and professional musicians and singers were among the few people who could read music.

Mechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many instruments originated during the Renaissance. Some instruments used during the Renaissance were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were part of [[guild]]s, which kept playing techniques secret. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary.
*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet.
*Trumpet: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. This limited the types of melodies that Renaissance trumpets could play. They were also made in different sizes.
*[[Sackbut]]: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century

Stringed instruments included:
*[[Viol]]: This hollow, wooden stringed instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly had six strings. It was usually played with a bow.
*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small [[harp]], although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum (or "pick"). Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Some newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
*[[Hurdy-gurdy]]: (Also known as the "wheel fiddle"), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its "drone strings" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
*[[Gittern]] and [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]]: these instruments were used throughout Europe. They were the forerunners of modern plucked string instruments including the [[mandolin]] and acoustic guitar.

Percussion instruments included:
*[[Tambourine]]: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck.
*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth.

Woodwind instruments included:

*[[Shawm]]: A typical shawm is keyless and about a foot long, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were commonly made of wood and more expensive models had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular [[double reed]] instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the early predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.
*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.
*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
*[[Transverse flute]]: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.
*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made of wood, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

===Baroque===
During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (ca. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of [[pipe organ]]s and [[harpsichord]]s, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors (timbres and sounds). Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the [[viol|viola da gamba]] stop. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's "golden age," as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as [[Arp Schnitger]], Jasper Johannsen, [[Zacharias Hildebrandt]] and [[Gottfried Silbermann]] constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large [[Pedal keyboard|Pedal]] and Rückpositiv divisions.

Harpsichord builders in the [[Southern Netherlands]] built instruments with two keyboard (two manuals) which could be used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]]. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs (groups) of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound; this enabled the harpsichorist to have two dynamics and tone colours from one instrument). Another approach that could be used on a two manual harpischord would be to use a coupler to make one manual play two choirs of strings (e.g., an 8' set of strings and a 16' set of strings an octave lower), so that this manual could be used for a loud solo sound, and then having another manual set to trigger only one manual, creating an [[accompaniment]] volume. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] choirs, adding to the lower register and [[eight foot pitch|two-foot]] choirs, which added to the upper register.

The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]]. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume and sustain, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control.

Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would [[Damping|damp]] the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano [[Action (piano)|action]] was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more [[sustain]] than the clavichord. The [[harpsichord]] continued to be used in performances during the first 50 years of the piano's existence; however, after 1750, the harpsichord was gradually phased out of orchestras and small music groups.

===Classicism===

From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing [[Industrial Revolution]] with resources such as high-quality steel [[piano wire]] for [[Strings (music)|strings]], and precision [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] for the production of [[Cast iron|iron frames]]. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five [[octave]]s of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.
Early technological progress owed much to the firm of [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]]. [[John Broadwood]] joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, [[Americus Backers]], to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the "grand". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.

They sent pianos to both [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a [[Interval (music)|fifth (interval)]] during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

The [[cornet]], a piston-valved brass instrument related to the trumpet, could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. [[Beethoven]]'s instrumentation for orchestra added [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] (1804–1808). A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver effects of "storm" and "sunshine" in the composer's dramatic [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]]. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] expanded the sound of the orchestra.

===Romanticism===
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in [[chamber music]] groups, such as [[string quartet]]s. Since mass-market sheet music was relatively inexpensive, this enabled composers and songwriters to distribute their songs and musical pieces to a larger audience and over a larger geographic area. While the widespread dissemination of sheet music helped to spread musical styles across a larger area, the impact was nevertheless restricted to the socioeconomic segments that could read music, [[sightsinging|sing melodies from sheet music]] and own pianos and other musical instruments–namely the middle class and the upper class. Individuals from lower socioeconomic segments were only indirectly able to benefit from this wider dissemination of musical styles (i.e., by hearing new songs performed by professional musicians in [[brothel]]s or [[tavern]]s), as poor people could typically not read music or own pianos or other expensive instruments.

New instruments such as the saxophone began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]]. The [[euphonium]] was used in a few late Romantic and works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornet]]s appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] firm manufactured pianos used by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the Érard firm manufactured those used by [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, [[Sébastien Érard]] invented the double escapement [[Action (piano)|action]], which incorporated a ''repetition lever'' (also called the ''balancier'') that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by [[Henri Herz]], the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.

Other improvements of the piano mechanism included the use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by [[Jean-Henri Pape]] in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The [[Sostenuto|sostenuto pedal]], invented in 1844 by [[Jean-Louis Boisselot]] and copied by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

One innovation that helped create the powerful, loud sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string [[Tension (physics)|tension]] that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece [[cast iron]] frame was patented in 1825 in [[Boston]] by [[Alpheus Babcock]],&lt;ref name="isacoff"&gt;Isacoff (2012, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of [[Birmingham]] brought out a form of piano wire made from [[cast steel]]; according to Dolge it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."&lt;ref name="Dolge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolge|first1=Alfred |title=Pianos and Their Makers: A Comprehensive History of the Piano Volume 1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486228568|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvYgWaXfcIYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, which made the piano louder and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] height. The mechanical action structure of the [[upright piano]] was invented in London, England in 1826 by [[Robert Wornum]], and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri, ed.|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93796-2|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright pianos were more compact than grand pianos, and less expensive, so the invention of the upright piano helped make the piano an even more important instrument in private homes (for amateur music-making); in schools; in rehearsal halls; and in some types of performance venues.

'''Nacirema''' ("American" spelled backwards) is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] in relation to aspects of the behavior and society of citizens of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The [[neologism]] attempts to create a deliberate sense of self-distancing in order that American anthropologists might look at their own culture more objectively.

=="Body Ritual among the Nacirema"==
{{wikisource|Body Ritual among the Nacirema|"Body Ritual among the Nacirema"}}
The original use of the term in a social science context was in "Body Ritual among the Nacirema", which [[satire|satirizes]] [[anthropology|anthropological]] papers on "other" cultures, and the [[culture of the United States]]. [[Horace Mitchell Miner]] wrote the paper and originally published it in the June 1956 edition of ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, H.M., "Body Ritual Among the Nacirema", ''American Anthropologist'', vol 58: pp. 503-507, June 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimsdale, Joel E. "The Nacirema Revisited." Annals Of Behavioral Medicine 23.1 (2001): 75. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Sylvester A. "The Rise Of The Nacirema And The Descent Of European Man: A Response To Manuel A. Vásquez's More Than Belief." Method &amp; Theory In The Study Of Religion 24.4/5 (2012): 464-481. Religion and Philosophy Collection. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the paper, Miner describes the Nacirema, a little-known tribe living in [[North America]]. The way in which he writes about the curious practices that this group performs distances readers from the fact that the North American group described actually corresponds to modern-day Americans of the mid-1950s. The article sometimes serves as a demonstration of a [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] shift with relation to [[sociology]].{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Miner presents the Nacirema as a group living in the territory between the Canadian [[Cree]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] and [[Tarahumara|Tarahumare]] of Mexico, and the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] of the [[Antilles]]. The paper describes the typical Western ideal for oral cleanliness, as well as providing an outside view on hospital care and on [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref name = Miner /&gt; The Nacirema are described as having a highly developed market economy that has evolved within a rich natural habit.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Horace. "Body Ritual among the Nacirema." American Anthropologist 1956: 503. JSTOR Journals. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miner's article became a popular work, reprinted in many introductory textbooks and used as an example [[process analysis]] in the literature text ''[[The Bedford Reader]]''. The article itself received the most reprint permission requests of any article in ''American Anthropologist'', but has become part of the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Some of the popular aspects of Nacirema culture include: medicine men and women (doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists), a charm-box (medicine cabinet), the mouth-rite ritual ([[tooth brushing|brushing teeth]]), and a cultural hero known as Notgnihsaw ([[George Washington|Washington]] spelled backwards).&lt;ref name = Miner /&gt; These ritual practices are prescribed as how man should comport himself in the presence of sacred things. These sacred aspects are the rituals that the Nacirema partake in throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert Alun. "Myth And Symbol Among The Nacirema Tsigoloicos: A Fragment." American Sociologist 15.4 (1980): 207-212. SocINDEX with Full Text. 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mysterious fall of the Nacirema==
In 1972 Neil B. Thompson revisited the Nacirema after the fall of their civilization. Thompson's paper, unlike Miner's, primarily offered a [[social commentary]] focused on [[environmental issue]]s. Thompson paid special attention to the [[Automobile|Elibomotua]] cult and its efforts to modify the environment.

{{quote|The high esteem of the cult is demonstrated by the fact that near every population center, when not disturbed by the accumulation of debris, archaeologists have found large and orderly collections of the Elibomotua cult symbol. The vast number of these collections has given us the opportunity to reconstruct with considerable confidence the principal ideas of the cult. The newest symbols seem to have nearly approached the ultimate of the Nacirema's cultural ideal. Their colors, material, and size suggest an enclosed mobile device that corresponds to no color or shape found in nature, although some authorities suggest that, at some early time in the development, the egg may have been the model. The device was provided with its own climate control system as well as a system that screened out many of the shorter rays of the light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thompson |first=Neil B. | title=The mysterious fall of the Nacirema | journal=Natural History | volume=81 | issue=11 | date=1 Jan 1972 | pages=412-7 | url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/oussele/331/The%20Mysterious%20Fall%20of%20the%20Nacirema.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article is reprinted and appears as the final chapter in an anthology called ''Nacirema: Readings on American Culture''. The volume contains an array of scholarly investigations into American social anthropology as well as one more article in the "Nacirema" series, by Willard Walker of Wesleyan University: (American Anthropologist, Volume 72, Issue 1, pages 102–105, February 1970) "The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the [[Teacher|TI'YCIR]] Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture." This article laments the corrosive and subjugating ritual of attending [[School|''sguwlz'']]. On [[English_phonology|phonology]], the anthropologist notes:

{{quote|The vowel system of Secular Nacireman consists of nine phonemically distinct vowels distinguished on the basis of three degrees of tongue height and three degrees of tongue advancement.... There can be no question as to the validity of these nine vocalic phonemes, for each is attested by a number of minimal pairs elicited independently from several [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]]. Curiously enough, however, most informants insist that only five vowels exist in the language: these are called ''ˀey, ˀiy, ˀay, ˀow,'' and ''yuw,'' and are invariably cited in precisely that order.... The discovery of the widespread myth of the five-vowel system prompted the present writer to conduct a series of intensive interviews and administer questionnaires to a sample of Nacireman informants with a view to mapping the general outlines of Nacireman folk linguistics. This research strategy ultimately provided compelling evidence that it is the ''ti'yčɨr'' caste that has disseminated the notion of the five-vowel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Walker | first=Willard | date=1 Feb 1970 | title=The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the ''ti'yčɨr'' Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture | journal=American Anthropologist | volume=72 | issue=1 | pages=102–105 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1970.72.1.02a00130/pdf | accessdate=17 Jul 2016 | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.1.02a00130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This refers to the conceptualization of the English vowel system based on orthography (with ''5'' vowels), which is in stark contrast to the actual system (with nine vowels and several diphthongs).

==Nacirema vs Teamsterville==
[[Gerry Philipsen]] (1992) studies what he terms "[[Speech code theory|speech code]]s" among the Nacirema, which he contrasts with the speech codes of another semi-fictionalized group of Americans, the inhabitants of Teamsterville culture. His Nacirema comprises primarily middle-class west-coast Americans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking Culturally Explorations in Social Communication|last=Philipsen|first=Gerry|publisher=SUNY|year=1992|isbn=978-0-7914-1163-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Nacirema is the name of a fictional country in Ronald M. Green's role-playing game aimed at explaining to undergraduate students the fundamentals of [[John Rawls]]'s theory of [[justice as fairness]]. In "The Rawls Game" (1986), Green asks the students to take on the role of Nacireman citizens. Acting from unrestrained self-interest, the citizens vote on a series of public issues and attempt to find solutions that do not require anyone to be forced to act against their own will. The goal of the game is to show that the only way to obtain social fairness is to ignore one's own individual circumstances (race, sex, religion, income, etc.) when making deliberations that affect public life.

== Overview ==

'''Petroleum Training Institute''' ('''P.T.I.''') in [[Effurun]], [[Delta State]] was established in 1973 by the federal government of [[Nigeria]] as a prerequisite for the membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]) to train indigenous middle-level manpower to meet the labour force demands of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria and the [[West Africa]]n subregion. It awards General Welding Certificates, ND (National Diploma) and [[Higher National Diploma|HND]] (Higher National Diploma) certificates.

The Institute is headed by the Principal and CEO Professor Sunny Iyuke, who last served at the university of Witswatersrand (Johannesburg),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/staff/academic-a-z-listing/i/sunnyiyukewitsacza/|title=Sunny.Iyuke@wits.ac.za - Wits University|last=Johannesburg|first=The University of the Witwatersrand,|website=www.wits.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to Nigeria to head the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://punchng.com/fg-appoints/|title=FG appoints Iyuke Principal of PTI|work=Punch Newspapers|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed following the retirement of the Institutes immediate past Principal/CEO - Mr A.j.

''' Political psychological rationalization''' ('''PPR''') is a phenomenon seen in [[political warfare]] and election campaign [[rhetoric]], meant to displace a perceived fault, short coming, mistake, or problem from one political actor, and attach it to another political actor, generally an opponent.  While not truly [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] in the context of psychology—where a problem, short coming, mistake, or fault is justified and allowed to endure—PPR maintains the negative connotation of the original flaw, transfers that connotation to a target actor, and then seeks to destroy the flaw (and consequently the actor) through association with said flaw, but with a political purpose and focus.  Political psychological rationalization exploits a number of psychological principles to manipulate the perceptions of different actors including [[groupthink]], [[cognitive dissonance]], and other forms of [[psychological manipulation]].  An example of PPR would be "Candidate A" accusing "Candidate B" of having an onerous tax policy for not cutting taxes while Candidate A had already raised taxes previously in his or her career, but having accused Candidate B of having an onerous tax policy is seen as being in favor of cutting taxes.  Use of PPR can also run the risk of backfiring against the broadcaster if knowledge of hypocritical behavior on the part of the displacing political actor becomes known.  In cases where this has happened, the original negative association can become reoriented back to the initiating political actor.  As tool of political warfare, PPR has been used by a wide array of factions, ideologies, actors, and regimes including fascists, communists, religious extremists, electoral campaign rhetoric, and non-governmental organizations.

==Psychological influences==

As a tool of [[political warfare]], PPR utilizes a number of [[psychological]] and [[sociological]] concepts,  particularly the construct of [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]].  In psychology, rationalization is defined by the DSM-IV as when "the individual deals with emotional conflict or internal or external stressors by concealing the true motivations for his or her own thoughts, actions, or feelings through the elaboration of reassuring or self serving but incorrect explanations."&lt;ref&gt;Association, published by the American Psychiatric (2000). DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4TH ED. ed.). United States: AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC). p. 812. {{ISBN|978-0-89042-025-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Succinctly, this means that people will act in a way that coincides with their thoughts.  If people conduct an action that goes outside their beliefs, then the mindset of the action or belief must change to create an internal balance (or rationalization).  Claude Steele famously stated that rationalization is a defense mechanism developed to protect the self from dissenting opinions or decisions, thereby reaffirming an individual's own beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M. (1988). The psychology of self-affirmation: Sustaining the integrity of the self. In Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 21, pp. 261-302). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion for one's actions or beliefs is also known as [[self-affirmation]].  Steele  suggests that through self-affirmation, one's actions and beliefs maintain a mental balance. Current research on self-affirmation strengthens this view especially when seeing how people interact with people of similar actions or beliefs. When accompanied in a group setting, people can fall into a group-minded train of thinking called [[groupthink]]. In a political context, groupthink can lead to people believing their viewpoints or political beliefs are rational and normal, when really these viewpoints are isolated to the group.

In theory, a political actor using PPR could exploit the phenomenon of groupthink if the group idea has unfounded credibility due to many members of a adhering to the idea in a desire to maintain cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groupthink|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupthink|work=Definition Groupthink|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;to rationalize a particular political position.  A common example is [[social media]].  If one's social media network consists of people with only similar opinions, then one will believe that their belief is rational and common.  Importantly, they will also be less likely to take dissenting viewpoints seriously, thus feeding the cycle of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;Majchrzak, A., Faraj, S., Kane, G. C., &amp; Azad, B. (2013). The contradictory influence of social media affordances on online communal knowledge sharing. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19(1), 38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In some cases, PPR might also be a [[defense mechanism]] against being branded with a negative image by an opponent through active exploitation of [[cognitive dissonance]], creating alternative messages to rationalize a real or perceived inconsistency in policy or a previous attack by an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=What is Cognitive Dissonance|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/dissonance.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the highly subjective nature of both broadcaster and target audience perceptions, it is difficult to definitively label a particular messaging campaign as being an example of PPR.  

===Contributing theories===

Groupthink refers to a state of mind when a group of people overlook their personal decisions and motivations in order to maintain the relationship of the in-group.&lt;ref&gt;Janis, I. L. (1971). Groupthink. Psychology today, 5(6), 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Using groupthink, individuals are at  risk of influence from others.  This could result in the individual agreeing with unfounded ideas or credibility because many members of a particular group adhere to it in a desire to maintain cohesion. Janis also found that intelligence did not factor into the likelihood for groupthink; however, agreeableness and self-identification were strong factors. An example of groupthink exists within sociopolitical research across academia.  In their famous review, Inbar and Lammers found a bias of research favoring or utilizing liberal participants over conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Inbar, Y., &amp; Lammers, J. (2012). Political diversity in social and personality psychology. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7(5), 496-503.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that this groupthink towards liberal participants may be affecting sociological, psychological, and political research that is being generalized to the overall population.  This finding suggests that people across various domains and intelligence are susceptible to groupthink.   

===Psychological constructs===

[[Cognitive dissonance]] also plays a strong roll in how the self rationalizes a real or perceived inconsistency with the self's beliefs.  When an individual acts in a manner that does not match their internal beliefs, there is a mental conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1962). A theory of cognitive dissonance (Vol. 2). Stanford university press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to override this dissonance, the person must either change the behavior, or change their beliefs.  As seen with groupthink, individuals adapt their behavior in order to maintain status-quo with the group.  In a political setting, this could be incredibly dangerous.

In their 2013 literature review, Lodge and Taber looked at the components of a rationalizing voter.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, M. &amp; Taber, C. (2007). The Rationalizing Voter: Unconscious Thought in Political Information Processing. SSRN Electronic Journal. doi: 10.2139/ssrn.1077972.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their review touched on the psychological constructs of [[automaticity]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]], [[long-term memory]], and [[cognitive bias]].  They argue that voters utilize their beliefs and attitudes to construct heuristics to make judgments about political decisions.  When creating these heuristics and recalling memories, voters utilize long-term memory to construct a cohesive picture that mirrors what they believe to match their political beliefs. This is important when considering voters in the booth trying to recall what they know about the campaigning candidates.  Utilizing heuristics, voters will recall items that are the most salient within memory.  This ability to recall items can be impacted by the [[availability heuristic]] and [[representative heuristic]].

==Use in American electoral campaign rhetoric==
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|250px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
One of the most controversial examples of PPR in American electoral [[rhetoric]] is President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s use of the [[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]] ad against Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in the 1964 presidential campaign, which was used to create an image of his opponent as belligerent and [[reactionary]] in foreign affairs.  The ad depicted a small girl counting the petals on a daisy.  The camera slowly zooms in on the girl while the counting by the girl is replaced by a loudspeaker counting down to zero, at which point the picture changes from the girl counting petals to a nuclear explosion.  Johnson's voice is then overheard saying,

"These are the stakes – to make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die."&lt;ref&gt;"Transcript of 'Peace, Little Girl' 1964 Democratic Campaign". Copy from LBJ Library via CONELRAD. http://conelrad.com/daisy/documents.php.  1964. Retrieved 22 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ad also urged people to vote for President Johnson.  While no intended target of the ad was ever specified, the implication was that if one voted against Johnson, they would be voting for [[nuclear war]].  The ad was only ever aired once due to intense negative reaction from the public, but the association with nuclear war followed Senator Goldwater for the rest of the election.&lt;ref&gt;"Correspondence regarding The Daisy Ad from Senator Everett M. Dirksen." Copy from LBJ library via CONELRAD. http://conelrad.com/daisy/documents.php. 12 September 1964. Retrieved 22 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  President Johnson by default became associated with moderation and peace, even though he had endorsed the [[domino theory]] as John F. Kennedy's vice-president in 1961, creating a predisposition to expanding the Vietnam War in 1965 after the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident.

==Use during the Cold War==
A protracted political warfare campaign was waged between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States during the [[Cold War]], in which both sides made extensive use of PPR. It consisted of the multiple accusations of government officials from the Communist Bloc and the West. In particular, the PPR was objectified in the struggle of each side to justify its political shortcomings by vilifying the ideology of the opponent. The ban of Western media and Western culture in the Soviet countries was an attempt by Kremlin to limit any potential for growing Western influence in these societies. Moreover, communist states were becoming more eager for the culture of consumerism and the access to the goods and services available in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bren|editor1-first=Paulina|editor2-last=Neuburger|editor2-first=Mary|title=Communism unwrapped: Consumption in cold war Eastern Europe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to frame the censorship into a positive context and to rationalize the it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gulyás|first1=Ágnes|title=Communist media economics and the consumers: The case of the print media of East Central Europe|journal=International Journal of Media Management|date=2001|volume=3|issue=2|page=74-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet regime was openly opposing Western culture with the argument that it was a source of the detrimental bourgeois influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poiger|first1=Uta|title=Jazz, rock, and rebels: Cold War politics and American culture in a divided Germany|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening the values of the communist society. The official and unofficial state measures undertaken against the Western culture were portrayed by the Soviet regime as a mechanism for protection of the population against the low morality of the decadent capitalistic society. Some acts of the modern Russian leadership also point to the same tendency even after the end of the Cold War. Namely, the Orthodox Christian community is the institution supposed to provide a protection from the 'Western philosophy of drugs, egotism and moral relativism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Herpen|first1=Marcel|title=Putin's propaganda machine: Soft power and russian foreign policy|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the PPR on American side, some examples are also present. Between 1946 to 1956, there was a censorship campaign against schools and libraries in an effort to remove literature, described as 'radical'. The political move was explained through the danger that such literature was posing to the American democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mediavilla|first1=Cindy|title=The war on books and ideas: The California Library Association and anti-communist censorship in the 1940s and 1950s|journal=Library Trends|date=1997|volume=46|issue=2|pages=331-347}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1950s the members of the Communist party and supporters of their ideas were persecuted and faced hostilities and rejection both by the side of the government and the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=L. Sullivan|first1=John|last2=Piereson|first2=James|last3=E. Marcus|first3=George|title=Sullivan, J. L., Piereson, J., &amp; Marcus, G. E. (1993). Political tolerance and American democracy|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Soviet sentiment in America during the first half of the Cold War was measured to be greater than in European countries that were directly facing the consequences of the communist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wald|first1=Kenneth|title=The Religious Dimension of American Anti-Communism|journal=Journal of Church and State|date=1994|volume=36|issue=3|page=483-506}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Soviet campaign that led to the ban of many literary works during the Cold War entailed similar consequences for the modern art, described as an outlet of communist influence as well. Prominent artists that were allegedly having ties to communist supporters and thus presumably sharing sentiments to Communism suffered significant consequences as a result of their affiliation. The U.S. authorities decided for works of such artists that "no matter how innocuous the subject matter, be banned from publicly supported arts institutions and most especially from federally sponsored cultural exchange"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Hart Mathews|first1=Jane|title=Art and Politics in Cold War America|journal=The American Historical Review|date=1976|volume=81|issue=4|page=762-787}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This political move was intended to portray America as a non-materialist society that deeply cares for the culture and the arts and is ready to exchange ideas with other countries that share the same values. The American Cold War culture enjoyed much more independence than the artists in the East due to the numerous checks that the works had to go through in order to ensure compliance with the goals of the state policies. At the same time, the literature and the arts in the U.S. were still influenced to a large extent by the ideological war between capitalism and communism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tony|first1=Shaw|title=The Politics of Cold War Culture|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|date=2001|volume=3|issue=3|page=59-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Critical theorists in International Relations see the period of the Cold War as a time-frame of intensive building and confirmation of the state's identity. It is achieved through the construction of an "enemy" in the eyes of the public while at the same time a real material threat was not present to an extent to which the undertaken measures would be justified by concrete facts about the strategic interests of the U.S. or its security&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=David|title=Writing security: United States foreign policy and the politics of identity|date=1992|publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another example of the American use of PPR during the [[Cold War]] is the fallacy of the "[[missile gap]]".  Claims that the Soviet Union was outpacing the United States in production numbers of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) and would soon be at a disadvantage, surfaced during the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Central Intelligence Agency.  "Memorandum to Holders of NIE 11-5-58".  25 November 1958. Retrieved 23 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and had peaked by the election of 1960.  Although it had been disproven by the intelligence community, political elites continued to use the missile gap for their own gains.  In this case however, the objective of PPR was not so much to demonize the Soviet Union (in fact, that had already been rhetorically established), but to create a perceived US deficiency to spur US action on the issue.  Since any evidence invalidating the missile gap theory was classified, no cognitive dissonance was required to defend the rationalization that the US needed more strategic weapons, and group think could be harnessed to keep the conversation centered on strategic weapons, as opposed to other fronts on which the US could be countering the Soviets.  The reality of this rationalization is that there was indeed a missile gap during this time period, but in favor of the United States.

==Examples in contemporary international relations==

The use of PPR has become prevalent in the [[public diplomacy]] campaigns of [[religious extremist]]s, particularly [[Islamic extremism|radical Islamist]] groups.  While rhetorically attacking the United States and its allies as being "crusaders" out to impose their ideals on the Muslim world, many groups claiming to resist that trend blame the state of the Muslim world immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on a failure of the umma to resist as well, leaving only the jihadist groups left to carry on the struggle, like [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheuer|first=Michael|title=Al-Qaeda Doctrine: Training the Individual Warrior|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=719&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=239&amp;no_cache=1|work=Terrorism Focus Volume: 3 Issue: 12|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903120850/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By claiming to resist a perceived invader, these groups can then associate themselves with an image of benevolence while demonizing the United States—despite committing many of the same excesses of which they accuse the United States, such as labeling other Muslims "infidels" who support the US, and imposing (theological) norms onto populations that do not necessarily share them.

Political psychological rationalization also continues to factor into modern public diplomacy efforts as a means to predispose target audiences to a message from a broadcasting actor.  Aspects of PPR can be seen in the current media campaign surrounding [[China's peaceful rise]], and how certain actions taken by the Chinese government are portrayed in both official statements and the larger news media.  A commonly repeated theme is that China's military modernization and expansion is a reflection of growth in the Chinese economy and presence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's military rise: The Dragon's New Teeth|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21552193|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rationalization in response to a perception that the expanding nature of the Chinese military will result in increased Chinese aggressiveness.  By using the term "peaceful rise" and seeking to portray the military expansion as part of a country's natural development, China is attempting to displace the fear (other countries) and perceived aggression (by China) and displace the negative implicated with its military growth and attach them to nations attempting to challenge China by creating the image that anyone who worries about China is merely paranoid or jealous of China's development.  In repeated use of this rationalization, China is conditioning observing parties to think that the "peaceful rise" is the norm, using group think to delegitimize opponents and cognitive dissonance to rebut any mention of inconsistencies in official messaging from the Chinese government.

The '''professional practice of behavior analysis''' is one domain of behavior analysis: the others being [[radical behaviorism]], [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="Cooper et al. 07"&gt;{{cite book |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |last=Cooper |first=John |author2=Timothy Heron |author3=William Heward  |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-142113-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The professional practice of behavior analysis is the delivery of interventions to consumers that are guided by the principles of behaviorism and the research of both the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis. Professional practice seeks maximum precision to change behavior most effectively in specific instances.&lt;ref name="Cooper et al. 07"/&gt; Behavior analysts are [[mental health professional]]s and, in some states, may hold a license, certificate or registration as a behavior analyst. In other states, there are no laws governing their practice and, as such, the practice may be prohibited as falling under the practice definition of other mental health professionals.   This is rapidly changing as Behavior Analysts are becoming more and more common.

The professional practice of behavior analysis is a hybrid discipline with specific influences coming from counseling, psychology, education, special education, communication disorders, physical therapy and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D. &amp; Dziewolska, H. (2008). Licensing behavior analysis. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(1), 1–13. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline it has its own conferences, organizations, certification processes and awards.

==Defining the scope of practice==
{{Main|Licensed behavior analysts}}
The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB) defines [[behavior analysis]] as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacb.com BACB]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The field of behavior analysis grew out of the scientific study of principles of learning and behavior. It has two main branches: experimental and applied behavior analysis. The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the basic science of this field and has over many decades accumulated a substantial and well-respected research literature. This literature provides the scientific foundation for applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is both an applied science that develops methods of changing behavior and a profession that provides services to meet diverse behavioral needs. Briefly, professionals in applied behavior analysis engage in the specific and comprehensive use of principles of learning, including operant and respondent learning, in order to address behavioral needs of widely varying individuals in diverse settings. Examples of these applications include: building the skills and achievements of children in school settings; enhancing the development, abilities, and choices of children and adults with different kinds of disabilities; and augmenting the performance and satisfaction of employees in organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavior Analysis Certification Board|url=http://www.bacb.com/index.php?page=2|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

As the above suggests, behavior analysis is based on the principles of [[operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]]. [[Applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) include the use of [[behavior management]], [[behavioral engineering]] and [[behavior therapy]]. Behavior analysis is an active, environmental-based approach.

Currently in the U.S. some behavior analysts at the masters level are licensed; others work with an international certification where licenses are unavailable, although this may not be allowed in some states or jurisdictions. At the doctoral level many are licensed as [[psychologist]]s with Diplomate status in behavioral psychology or licensed as licensed behavior analysts. Diplomate status alone, however, does not allow one to practice in every state and each state's regulatory statute must be reviewed for the appropriateness and legality of practice.

===Certification===
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) offers a technical [[Professional certification|certificate]] in behavior analysis. The American Psychological Association offers a diplomate (post PhD and licensed certification) in behavioral psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, E.T. (2001) Board Certification (Diplomate) in Behavioral Psychology. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(1), l5–28 [http://wwwbaojournal.com BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706003236/http://wwwbaojournal.com/ |date=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meaning of certification===
BACB is a private non-profit organization without governmental powers to regulate behavior analytic practice. However it does wield the power to suspend or revoke certification from those certified if they violate the strict ethical guidelines of practice. As many states are without a licensure act, this has been sufficient to deter violators as it removes their ability to vendor with the state, schools, and insurance companies under that certification. While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants are able to practice independently within the scope of their practice and training. Thus, a BCBA (such as those who go into marketing, engineering, or other approved fields in which BCBAs work) who has never trained to work nor worked with children diagnosed with autism should not attempt to do so independently. Most health insurance companies also recognize the BCBA credential as one conferring the capability and the right to practice independently in many states (including California with the recent passage of SB 946 into law). Some states still require certificants to be licensed by their respective jurisdictions for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems, and a number of states including Arizona and Nevada have created a specific BCBA licensing program (for a full list please refer to the BACB website). Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services, unlicensed certificants may be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor's license when treating disorders if that jurisdiction allows such supervision. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision, unless the law or precedent prohibits such practice. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise.

===Licensure===
The model licensing act for behavior analysts has been revised several times to reflect best practices and policy. Previous versions included provisions that would have made it in practice more difficult then to obtain the necessary experiential hours for license and independent practice as a clinical psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;The most current act can be found here: http://www.apbahome.net/model-licensing-act.pdf as of Jan 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board as well as the BACB, both of which make sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the BACB and licensing board investigate ethical complaints. A licensed behavior analyst would have equal training, knowledge, skills and abilities in their discipline as would a [[mental health counselor]] or [[marriage and family therapist]] in their discipline. In February 2008, Indiana, Arizona, Massachusetts, Vermont, Oklahoma and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. Pennsylvania was the first state in 2008 to license behavior specialists to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license behavior analysts. Other states such as Nevada and Wisconsin have also passed behavior analytic licensure.

In California, after the defeat of a bill to create a license for BCBAs in 2011, the state government instead passed SB 946 which mandates that all non-governmental insurance agencies reimburse for BCBA for behavior therapy in treating autism, starting in 2012. Unlike many weaker bills mandating that autism be covered by insurance, SB 946 does not currently impose an arbitrary cap on services by age or funding amount – in this it is similar to other treatments such as those for heart attacks or other chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of SB 946 can be found here: (http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/billtrack/text.html?bvid=20110SB94693CHP)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service delivery models==

===Definitions===
Behavior analytic services can be and often are delivered through various treatment modalities. These include:
* '''[[wikt:consultation|Consultation]]''' – an indirect model in which the consultant works with the consultee to change the behavior of the client.
* '''[[Therapy]]''' – (individual, group, or family) in which the therapist works directly with a person with some form of pathology to lessen the pathology.
* '''[[Counseling]]''' – where the counselor works directly with a person who has problems but no pathology.
* '''Coaching''' – in which the coach works with a person to achieve a life goal.

===Primary methods===
The two ''primary methods'' for delivering behavior analytic services are consultation and/or direct therapy; the former involves three parties: consultant, consultee and a client whose behavior is changed (who may or may not be present for all meetings).&lt;ref name="Bergan"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kratochwill, Thomas R. |author2=Bergan, John J. |title=Behavioral consultation and therapy |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-306-43345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultation can involve working with the consultee (i.e., a parent or teacher) to build a plan around the behavior of a client (i.e., a child or student), or training the consultees themselves to modify the behavior of the client. Within the domain of parent–child consultation, standard intervention includes teaching parents skills such as basic [[reinforcement]], [[Child time-out|time-out]] and how to manipulate different factors to modify behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tharp |first=R.J. |author2=Wetzel, R.G.  |title=Behavior Modification in the Natural Environment |publisher=Academic Press |year=1969 |isbn= 978-0-12-686050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct therapy involves the relationship of behavior analyst and client, usually one-on-one, in which the analyst is responsible for directly modifying the behavior of their client. Direct therapy is also used in schools but can also be found in [[group home]]s, in a [[behavior modification facility]] and in [[behavior therapy]]&lt;ref name="Bergan"/&gt; (where the focus may be on tasks such as quitting [[smoking]], modifying behaviors for [[sex offenders]] or other types of offenders, modifying behaviors related to [[mood disorder]]s) or to encourage job seeking behavior in psychiatric patients.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg86"&gt;Eisenberg, M.G. &amp; Cole, H.W. (1986). A behavioral approach to job seeking for psychiatrically impaired persons. ''Journal of Rehabilitation'', 52(2), 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. (1975). Behavioral self control with the mentally retarded. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 6(1), 27–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of behavior models===
Two older and less used models still exist for the delivery of behavior analytic services. These models worked mostly with normal or typically developing populations. These two models are the ''Behavioral Coaching'' and the ''Behavioral Counseling'' model. Both were very popular in the 1960s–1980s but have recently seen a decline in popularity, in spite of their success, as proponents argued the merits of holding strictly to learning theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W. (1978). Behavior Therapy's Identity Crisis. ''The Counseling Psychologist'' 7: 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, C.E. &amp; Coates, T.J. (1978). What Does It Mean to Be a Behavior Therapist? ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 3–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, L. (1978). Behavior Therapy Faces Middle Age. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, A.E. (1978). Behavior Therapy: Evolution and Expansion. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 34–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsley, O.R. (1978). What Did it Mean to be a Behavior Therapist? ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scriven, M. (1978). What Does it Mean to be a Self-Monitoring Behavior Therapist? ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, T.W. (1987). On the Reinvention of the Wheel, the Franchising of Science, and Other Pastimes. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 37–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International still retains a special interest group in behavioral counseling and coaching.

===History of behavioral counseling===
Behavioral counseling was very popular throughout the 1970s and at least into the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hosford, R. &amp; de Visser, L. (1974) ''Behavioral approaches to counseling: An introduction.'' Washington, DC: American Personnel and Guidance Association Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.D. &amp; Hosford, R.E. (1981). The future of behavioral counseling: Recommendations for a continued empiricism. ''Behavioral Counseling Quarterly'', 1, 9–28&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral counseling is an active action–oriented approach that works with the typically developing population but also assists people with specific/discrete problems such as career decision making, drinking, smoking or rehabilitation after injury.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, R.H. &amp; Allen, C.M. (1973). Behavior modification in rehabilitation facilities: A review. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 4(2), 83–95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, J.M. (1985). A behavioral perspective. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 16(3), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life coaching===
The behavioral [[coaching]] model is sometimes referred to as [[life coaching]]. However, like counselors and psychologists, life coaches can have varied orientations/change theories (see [[behavioral change theories]]). Behavioral life coaches operate mainly from a behavior analytic orientation. Unlike therapy this model is applied to people who desire to achieve a specific goal&lt;ref&gt;Simek, T.C. &amp; O'Brien, R.M. (1981).

Coaches use behavioral techniques such as objective setting, goal setting, self-control training and behavioral activation to help clients achieve specific life goals. Behavioral coaching was sometimes used to teach job skills to people having mental retardation or head injury. In this area the model made extensive use of task analysis, direct instruction, role play, reinforcement and error correction.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg86"/&gt; Often this approach employs techniques of [[direct instruction]].

===Goal of increasing reinforcement===
Behavioral counseling was largely seen as a growth model that tried to increase the individuals sense of "freedom" by helping the client reduce punishment or coercion in their lives, build skills, and increase access to reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Krumboltz69"&gt;Krumboltz, J.D. &amp; Thoreson, C.E.

===Therapy qualifications===
These are generally treatments based on [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) and involve intensive training of the therapists, extensive time spent in ABA therapy (20–40 hours per week) and weekly supervision by experienced clinical supervisors—known as board certified behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shook, G.L. |author2=Neisworth, J.T. |year=2005 |title=Ensuring appropriate qualifications for applied behavior analyst professionals: the Behavior Analyst Certification Board |journal=Exceptionality |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |doi=10.1207/s15327035ex1301_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABA therapy often employs principles of [[overlearning]] to help acquire mastery and fluency of skills.

===Children with autism===
The ABA approach teaches many skills such as appropriate play (a precursor to social interaction and engagement with the world and others),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stahmer, A.C. |year=1995 |title=Teaching symbolic play skills to children with autism using Pivotal Response Training |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=123–41 |doi=10.1007/BF02178500 |pmid=7559281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stahmer, A.C.; Schreibman, L. &amp; Palardy-Powell, N.

[http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; social, motor and verbal behaviors as well as reasoning skills and the ability to self-regulate appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00001163-200201000-00006 |author1=Harris, S.L. |author2=Delmolino, L. |title=Applied behavior analysis: its application in the treatment of autism and related disorders in young children |journal=Infants Young Child |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=11–7 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABA therapy is used to teach behaviors to individuals with [[autism]] who may not otherwise observe these behaviors spontaneously through imitation.

===Imitation===
Imitation can also be directly trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingersoll, B. |title=Teaching Imitation to Children with Autism: A focus on Social Reciprocity |journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |pages=269–277 |issue=3 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/h0100224}} [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; ABA therapies teach these skills through use of behavioral observation and reinforcement or prompting to teach each step of a behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simpson, R.L. |year=2001 |title=ABA and students with autism spectrum disorders: issues and considerations for effective practice |journal= Focus Autism Other Dev Disabl |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=68–71 |doi=10.1177/108835760101600202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and treatments===
Extensive research exists to show that behavior analysis is an effective treatment for autism with literally hundreds of studies showing its effectiveness with persons of all ages in enhancing functioning, building skills and independence as well as improving life quality.&lt;ref&gt;Matson, J.L.; Benavidez, D.A.; Compton, L.S.; Paclawskyj, T. &amp; Baglio, C. (1996). Behavioral treatment of autistic persons: A review of research from 1980 to the present. ''Research in Developmental Disabilities'', 17, 433–465.&lt;/ref&gt; What remains controversial are claims of behavior analysis "curing autism". This controversy exists because behavior analysis is used to alter rates of behavior, and not the condition of "autism." Nonetheless, behavior analysis is used to treat the behaviors of many in the autistic population.&lt;ref name="Brandsma01"&gt;Brandsma, L.L. &amp; Herbert, J.D. (2001). Applied Behavior Analysis for Childhood Autism: Does the Emperor Have Clothes? ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(1), 145–156 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While several small studies exist showing that behavior analysis holds promise in this area, the number of well-controlled studies do not rise to the level required by the American Psychological Association to hold the treatment as empirically supported in this area.&lt;ref name="Brandsma01"/&gt;

===Misconceptions of treatment===
&lt;!--What does the ABA stand for ?--&gt;
An increasing amount of research in the field of applied behavior analysis is concerned with autism; and it is a common misconception that behavior analysts work almost exclusively with individuals with autism and that ABA is synonymous with discrete trials teaching. ABA principles can also be used with a range of [[neurotypical|typical]] or atypical individuals whose issues vary from developmental delays, significant behavioral problems or undesirable habits.

Curriculum development in behavior analytic programs for children with autism is important.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, S.K. (2001). Content and Contingencies: Considerations Regarding Curriculum Development for Young Children with Autism. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 187–191 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum should carefully task analyze the skill needed to be learned and then ensure that proper tool skills have been taught before the skill itself is attempted to be taught.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, S.K. (2004) Selection-Based Imitation: A Tool Skill in the Development of Receptive Language in Children With Autism. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5(1), 26–34 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Applied behavior analysis is often confused as a ''table-only'' therapy. Properly performed, applied behavior analysis should be done in both table and [[pivotal response training|natural environments]] depending on the student's progress and needs.&lt;ref name="Ferraioli05"&gt;Ferraioli, S.; Hughes, C.; Smith, T. (2005). "A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism". ''Journal of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention'' 2(4), 224–240 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Once a student has mastered a skill at the table the team should move the student into a natural environment for further training and generalization of the skill.

Frequently standardized assessments such as the [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]] (ABLLS) is used to create a baseline of the learner's functional skill set. The ABLLS breaks down the learner's strengths and weaknesses to best tailor the applied behavior analysis curriculum to them. By focusing on the exact skills that need help the teacher does not teach a skill the student knows. This can also prevent student frustration at attempting a skill for which they are not ready.

Many families have fought school districts for such programs. [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]], a behavior analyst who often testified as an expert witness, provided several letters to lawyers before he died. Ohio State has archived those letters.&lt;ref name="OS1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baer |title=Letters |url=http://streaming1.osu.edu:7070/ramgen/media/behavioranal02/baer.rm |publisher=Ohio State |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete trials===
Discrete trials were originally used by people studying [[classical conditioning]] to demonstrate stimulus–stimulus pairing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Discrete trials are often contrasted with free operant procedures, like ones used by [[B.F. Skinner]] in learning experiments with rats and pigeons, to show how learning was influenced by rates of [[reinforcement]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The discrete trials method was adapted as a therapy for [[developmental disability|developmentally delayed]] children and individuals with autism. For example, [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]] used discrete trials to teach autistic children skills including making eye contact, following simple instructions, advanced language and social skills. These discrete trials involved breaking a behavior into its most basic functional unit and presenting the units in a series.

A discrete trial usually consists of the following: the antecedent, the behavior of the student and a consequence. If the student's behavior matches what is desired the consequence is something positive: food, candy, a game, praise, etc. If the behavior was not correct the teacher offers the correct answer then repeats the trial possibly with more prompting, if needed.

There is usually an inter-trial interval that allows for a few seconds to separate each trial to allow the student to process the information, teach the student to wait and make the onset of the next trial more discrete. Discrete trials can be used to develop most skills which includes cognitive, verbal communication, play, social and self-help skills. There is a carefully laid out procedure for error correction and a problem solving model to use if the program gets stuck.&lt;ref name="Ferraioli05"/&gt; Discrete trial is sometimes referred to as the [[Lovaas technique]].

Discrete trials have been helpful in the treatment of pediatric feeding problems&lt;ref&gt;Kerwin, M.L. (2003). Pediatric Feeding Problems. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 4(2), 162–175 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the prevention of feeding problems.&lt;ref name= "Pediatric Feeding Tube"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pediatric Feeding Disorders |url=https://pediatricfeeding.com/pediatric-feeding-problems/|publisher=Feeding Clinic of Santa Monica|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free operant procedures===
{{Main|Natural language procedures}}
In language training, many free operant procedures emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B.M. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1968). Establishing the use of descriptive adjectives in the spontaneous speech of disdvantaged children. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 1, 109–120&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures did not try to train discrimination first, and then passively wait for generalization, but instead worked from the start on actively promoting generalization.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, T.F. &amp; Baer, D.M. (1977). An implicit technology of generalization. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 10, 349–367.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the model was referred to as ''incidental teaching'' but later was called ''milieu language teaching'' and finally ''natural language teaching''. Peterson (2007) completed a comprehensive review of 57 studies on these training procedures. This review found that 84% of the studies of the natural language procedures looked at maintenance and 94% looked at generalization and were able to provide direct support of its occurrence as part of the training.

==Other applications of applied behavior analysis==

===Clinical behavior analysis===
{{Main|Clinical behavior analysis|Behavioral psychotherapy}}
Dougher's edited volume titled ''Clinical Behavior Analysis'' on Context Press highlights the application of behavior analysis to adult outpatients. He identifies four comprehensive behavior analytic programs: Stephen Hayes ''et al.''{{'s}} [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), Jacobson et al.  [[behavioral activation]] (BA), Kohlenberg &amp; Tsai's [[functional analytic psychotherapy]], Linehan Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and the [[Community Reinforcement Approach|community reinforcement approach]] for treating addictions. In addition, the book highlights several recent areas of functional analysis research for common clinical problems. Many of these areas are specified in the section on [[behavior therapy]].

===Community reinforcement approach and family training===
{{Main|Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training}}

''Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment'', 1(4), 279–285. Originally published in 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is no surprise many behavioral treatments would be found to be efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;Chambless, D. &amp; Hollon, S. (1998). Defining empirically supportable therapies. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', 66, 7–18.&lt;/ref&gt; One efficacious approach is the community reinforcement approach.

(2004) CRA and CRAFT: Behavioral Approaches to Treating Substance-Abusing Individuals. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5(4), pp. 391–403 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Started in the 1970s by [[Nathan H. Azrin]] and his graduate student Hunt, the community reinforcement approach is a comprehensive operant program built on a functional assessment of a client's drinking behavior and the use of positive reinforcement and [[contingency management]] for nondrinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, G.M. &amp; Azrin, N.H. (1973). A community-reinforcement approach to alcoholism. ''Behaviour Research and Therapy'', 11, 91–104.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with disulfiram ([[Aversion therapy|an aversive procedure]]) community reinforcement showed remarkable effects.&lt;ref&gt;Azrin, N.H.; Sisson, R.W.; Meyers, R.J. &amp; Godley, M.D. (1982). Alcoholism treatment by disulfiram and community reinforcement therapy. ''Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry'', 3, 105–112.&lt;/ref&gt; One component of the program that appears to be particularly strong is the non-drinking club.&lt;ref&gt;Mallams, J.H.; Godley, M.D.; Hall, G.M. &amp; Meyers, R.J. (1982). A social-systems approach to resocializing alcoholics in the community.

''International Journal of Behavioral Cconsultation and Therapy'', 3(1), 77–87 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

An offshoot of the community reinforcement approach is the [[Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training|community reinforcement approach and family training]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt; This program is designed to help family members of substance abusers feel empowered to engage in treatment. The rates of success have varied somewhat by study but seem to cluster around 70%.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, K.C.; Marlowe, D.B.; Festinger, D.S.; Garvey, K.A. &amp; LaMonaca, V. (1999).

{{Main|Exposure therapy}}
Methods of counter-conditioning and respondent extinction, called exposure therapy, are often employed by many behavior therapists in the treatment of phobias, anxiety disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and addictions (cue exposure).

===Operant-based EEG biofeedback===
{{Main|Biofeedback}}
Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be [[operant]]ly conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, J. (1968) Conscious control of brain waves. ''Psychology Today'', 1, 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He published an influential article in ''Psychology Today'' that summarized research showing subjects learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant "alpha state" characterized as an "alert calmness". These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) correlates of meditative states.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, J. (1969). [[Operant]] control of the EEG alpha rhythm. In C. Tart (Ed.), ''Altered states of consciousness''. NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operant conditioning]] of EEG has had considerable support in many areas including [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)&lt;ref&gt;Alhambra, M.A.; Fowler, T.P. &amp; Alhambra, A.A., (1995). EEG biofeedback: A new treatment option for ADD/ADHD. ''[[Journal of Neurotherapy]]'', 1(2), 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[seizure disorders]]. Early studies of the procedure included the treatment of seizure disorders. Luber and colleagues (1981) conducted a double blind crossover study showing that seizure activity decreased by 50% in the contingent conditioning of inhibiting brain waves as opposed to the non-contingent use.&lt;ref&gt;Lubar, J.F.; Shabsin, H.S.; Natelson, S.E.; Holder, G.S.; Whitsett, S.F.; Pamplin, W.E. &amp; Krulikowski, D.I.

''Archives of Neurology'', 38(11), 700–704.&lt;/ref&gt; Sterman (2000) reviewed 18 studies of a total of 174 clients and found 82% of the participants had significant seizure reduction (30% less weekly seizures).&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, M.B.

===Organizational===
{{Main|Organizational behavior management|Behavioral engineering|Behavior-based safety}}
Behavior analysis with organizations is sometimes combined with systems theory in an approach called organizational behavior management. This approach has shown success particularly in the area of [[behavior-based safety]]. Behavior safety research has lately become focused on factors that lead programs to being retained in institutions long after the designer leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, H.R. &amp; Boyce, T.E. (2001). Institutionalizing Behavior-Based Safety: Theories, Concepts, And Practical Suggestions. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(1), 76–82 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational===
{{Main|Direct instruction|Positive behavior support|Curriculum-based measurement|Functional analysis (psychology)}}
[[Direct instruction]] and [[Direct Instruction]]: the former representing the process and the latter a specific curriculum that highlights that process remain both current and controversial in behavior analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S.

School-wide [[positive behavior support]]&lt;ref name="Tobin01"/&gt; is based on the use of behavior analytic procedures delivered in an organizational behavior management approach. School-wide behavioral support has been increasingly accepted by administrators, law–makers and teachers as a way to improve safety in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sugai, G. &amp; Horner, R.H.

[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curriculum-based measurement]] and curriculum matching is another active area of application.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, A.D.; Skinner, C.H.; Williams, J.; Hawkins, R.; Neddenriep, C.E. &amp; Dizer, J. (2007). Comparing Comprehension Following Silent and Aloud Reading across Elementary and Secondary Students: Implication for Curriculum-Based Measurement. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(1), 9–23&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum-based measurement uses rate and reading performance as the primary variable in determining reading levels. The goal is to better match children to the appropriate curriculum level to remove frustration as well as to track reading performance over time to see if it is improving with intervention. This model also serves as the basis for [[response to intervention]] models.

===Hospital settings===
One area of interest in hospitals is the [[blocking effect]]—especially for conditioned [[taste aversion]]. This area of interest is considered important in the prevention of weigh loss during chemotherapy for cancer patients. Another area of growing interest in the hospital setting is the use of operant-based biofeedback with those suffering from cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;Colborne, G.R.; Wright, F.V. &amp; Naumann, S. (1994). Feedback of triceps surae EMG in gait of children with cerebral palsy: A controlled study.

===Residential treatment===
{{Main|Residential treatment center}}
Behavioral interventions have been very helpful in reducing problem behaviors in residential treatment centers.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Bodfish &amp; Edward A. Konarski (1992).

===Space program===
Probably one of the most interesting applications of [[behavior analysis]] in the 1960s was its contribution to the space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, J.V. |year=2007 |title=Behavior analysis in the space age |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=398–412 |url=http://baojournal.com |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area is used to train astronauts including the chimpanzees sent into space. Continued work in this area focuses on ensuring that astronauts who live in confined areas and space do not develop behavioral health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Emurian, H.H. |author2=Brady, J.V. |year=2007 |title=Behavioral health management of space dwelling groups: safe passage beyond earth orbit |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=113–35 |url=http://www.ibrinc.org/publications/Emurian_Brady_2007.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100607|citeseerx=10.1.1.599.8012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this work was led by pioneer behaviorist [[Joseph V. Brady]].

==Consumer and professional relationships==
Open communication and a supportive relationship between educational systems and families allow the student to receive a beneficial education. This pertains to typical learners as well as to individuals who need additional services. It was not until the 1960s that researchers began exploring behavior analysis as a method to educate those children who fall somewhere along the autism spectrum. Behavior analysts agree that consistency in and out of the school classroom is key in order for children with autism to maintain proper standing in school and continue to develop to their greatest potential.

Applied behavior analysts sometimes work with a team to address a person's educational or behavioral needs. Other professionals such as speech therapists, physicians and the primary caregivers are treated as key to the implementation of successful therapy in the applied behavior analysis (ABA) model. The ABA method relies on behavior principles to develop treatments appropriate for the individual. Regular meetings with professionals to discuss programming are one way to establish a successful working relationship between a family and their school. It is beneficial when a caregiver can conduct generalization procedures outside of school. In the ABA framework, developing and maintaining a structured working relationship between parents or guardians and professionals is essential to ensure consistent treatment.

==Intervention goals==
When working directly with clients, behavior analysts engage in a process of collaborative [[goal setting]].&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E.A. &amp; Latham, G.P. (1985). The application of goal setting to sports. ''Journal of Sports Psychology'', 7, 205–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Goal setting ensures that the client is already under [[stimulus control]] of the goal and is thus more likely to engage in behavior to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G. &amp; Paer, J.

==History==
Applied behavior analysis is the applied side of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. It is based on the principles of [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]] and represents a major approach to behavior therapies. Its origin can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]]'s 1959 article "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ayllon, T. |author2=Michael, J. |title=The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=323–34 |year=1959 |pmid=13795356 |doi= 10.1901/jeab.1959.2-323 |pmc=1403907}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to initial efforts to implement teaching machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year=1965 |volume=162 |issue=989 |pages=427–43 |title=The technology of teaching |author=Skinner, B.F. |doi=10.1098/rspb.1965.0048 |pmid=4378497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research basis of ABA can be found in the theoretical work of [[behaviorism]] and [[radical behaviorism]] originating with the work of [[B.F. Skinner]]. In 1968 Baer, Wolf and Risley wrote an article&lt;ref&gt;Baer, D.M.; Wolf, M.M.; Risley, T.R. (1968). "Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis". J Appl Behav Anal 1 (1): 91–7.&lt;/ref&gt; that was the source of contemporary [[applied behavior analysis]] providing the criteria to judge the adequacy of research and practice in applied behavior analysis. It became the core and centerpiece [[behavioral engineering]].

Work in respondent conditioning (what some would term [[classical conditioning]]) began with the work of [[Joseph Wolpe]] in the 1960s. It was improved by the work of [[Edna B Foa]] who did extensive research on [[exposure and response prevention]] for [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). In addition, she worked on [[exposure therapy]] for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Over the years most behavior analysts have existed and conducted research in many areas and University departments: behavior analysis, psychology, special education, regular education, speech–language pathology, communication disorders, school psychology, criminal justice and family life. They have belonged to many organizations including the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and have most often found a core intellectual home in the [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International.&lt;ref name="Twyman07"&gt;Twyman, J.S. (2007). A new era of science and practice inbehavior analysis. ''Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter'', 30(3), 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassert08"&gt;Hassert, D.L.; Kelly, A.N.; Pritchard, J.K. &amp; Cautilli, J.D. (2008).

===Core focus===
With a core focus on enhanced functioning and skill development behavior analytic interventions under the heading [[behavior therapy]] have come to form the core of evidence-based practices in speech–language pathology, [[organizational behavior management]], [[education]], [[mental health]] and [[addiction]] treatments. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well-established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[respondent conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue, W. |author2=Ferguson, K.E. |year=2006 |title=Evidence-based practice in psychology and behavior analysis |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–50 |url=http://baojournal.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1985 meta-analysis of [[social skills]] training methods found operant conditioning procedures had the largest effect size, the greatest generalization and the shortest training time; [[observational learning|modeling]], [[coaching]], and social cognitive techniques, respectively, had smaller and smaller effect sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schneider, B.H. |author2=Bryne, B.M. |year=1985 |chapter=Children's social skills training: a meta-analysis. |editor1=Schneider, B.H. |editor2=Rubin, K.H. |editor3=Ledingham, J.E. |title=Children's Peer Relations: Issues in Assessment and Intervention |pages=175–90 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
Behavior analysis remains one of the most active research areas in all of [[psychology]], [[counseling]], [[special education]], [[developmental disability]], [[mental health]] and other studies of [[human behavior]]. Current research in behavior analysis focuses on expanding the tradition by looking at setting events, [[behavioral activation]], the [[Matching law]], [[relational frame theory]], stimulus equivalences and [[covert conditioning]] as exemplified in Skinner's model of rule-governed behavior ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref name="Barry06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, J. |author2=McEachern, A. |author3=Schrepferman, L. |year=2006 |title=Rule-governance, correspondence training, and discrimination learning: a developmental analysis of covert conduct problems |journal=J Speech Lang Pathol Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43–55 |url=http://baojournal.com/SLP-ABA-VOL-1/SLP-ABA-1-1.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100187|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis has moved past being just basic interventions for problems and into more comprehensive analyses of [[behavior analysis of child development|child development behavior]].

===Experimental psychopathology===
Experimental psychopathology is a behavior therapy area in which animal models are developed to simulate human pathology. For example, Wolpe studied cats to build his theory of human [[anxiety]]. This work continues today in the study of both pathology and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Borrero, Timothy R. Vollmer, Andrew L. Samaha, Kimberly N. Sloman &amp; Monica T. Francisco (2007). Evaluating Features of Behavioral Treatments in the Nonhuman Animal Laboratory. ''Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(2), 136–144. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical controversies==
Initially, applied behavior analysis used punishment such as shouting and slaps to reduce unwanted behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Moser, D. |author2=Grant, A. |title=Screams, slaps and love |date=1965-05-07 |work=Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical opposition to such aversive practices caused them to fall out of favor and has stimulated development of less aversive methods. In general, aversion therapy and [[punishment]] are now less frequently used as ABA treatments due to legal restrictions.&lt;ref name="Mayer95"&gt;Mayer, G.R. &amp; Mayer, J.F. (1995). Legislation in California mandates behavior analysis services and minimizes use of aversives. ''The ABA Newsletter International'', 18, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, procedures such as odor aversion, [[covert sensitization]] and other [[covert conditioning]] procedures, based on punishment or aversion strategies, are still used effectively in the treatment of [[pedophiles]].&lt;ref name="Marshall91"&gt;Marshall, W.L.; Jones, R.; Ward, T.; Johnston, P. &amp; Bambaree, H.E. (1991). Treatment of sex offenders. ''Clinical Psychology Review'', 11, 465–485&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with some populations such as conduct disorder in children there is considerable evidence that has developed to show that all positive programs can produce change but that children will not enter into the normal range without [[punishment]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J. &amp; Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon Model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder. ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for intervention''. (page 6) APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H.M.; Colvin, G. &amp; Ramsey, E. (1995). ''Antisocial behavior in schools: Strategies and best practices''. Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have shifted to using [[child time-out]] and response–cost procedures to ensure that clients rights to effective interventions are met.

===Homosexuality===
In 1973 the APA [[Homosexuality and psychology#Declassification|removed]] homosexuality from its [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] yet it kept "ego dystonic" homosexuality as a condition until the DSM III-R (1987).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 1974 [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], pioneer of the use of discrete trial teaching (DTT) to treat autism, was the second author on a [[scientific journal|journal article]] describing the use of ABA{{Clarify|What do these initials mean|date=July 2010}} to reduce "feminine" behaviors and increase "masculine" behaviors of a male child in an effort to prevent adult [[transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rekers, G.A. |author2=Lovaas, O.I. |title=Behavioral treatment of deviant sex-role behaviors in a male child |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–90 |year=1974 |pmid=4436165 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1974.7-173 |pmc=1311956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments designed to uphold traditional sex-role behaviors were opposed by some behavior analysts who argued that the intervention was not justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nordyke, N.S. |author2=Baer, D.M. |author3=Etzel, B.C. |author4=LeBlanc, J.M. |title=Implications of the stereotyping and modification of sex role |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=553–7 |year=1977 |pmid=924924 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1977.10-553 |pmc=1311225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s Wolpe refused to treat homosexual behavior arguing that it was easier and more productive to treat the religious guilt than the homosexuality. He instead provided assertiveness training to a homosexual client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolpe, J. |year=1969 |title=The Practice of Behavior Therapy |publisher=Pergamon |isbn=978-0-08-021148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most behavior analysts and behavior therapists have not worked in sexual re–orientation therapy since [[Gerald Davison]] argued that the issue was not one of effectiveness but of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |year=1978 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=170–2 |title=Not can but ought: the treatment of homosexuality |author=Davison, G.C. |pmid=627651 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.1.170}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he wrote the paper presenting this position, Davison was president of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, now the [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]], and thus his views carried much weight. Davison argued that homosexuality is not pathological and is only a problem if it is regarded as one by society and the therapist.

==Ethical practice==

===Punishment and aversion therapies===
The use of [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and aversion therapy procedures are a constant ethical challenge for behavior analysts. One of the original reasons for the development of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board were cases of abuse from behaviorists.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts''. LEA&lt;/ref&gt; Both continue to draw proponents and opposition, however, in some of the more controversial cases some middle ground has been found through legislation (see [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]]).&lt;ref name="Mayer95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill would limit, not ban, shock therapy |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/17/showdown_over_shock_therapy/ |accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Wen, Patricia |date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex offenders and recidivism===
A study in 1991 showed that [[behavior modification]] was effective in [[sex offender]] treatment and [[covert sensitization]], and it has been shown to have some effects on reducing recidivism.&lt;ref name="Marshall91"/&gt; However Gene Able, who has done extensive research in this area, suggests that it is not as effective outside of the package which contains odor [[Aversion therapy|aversion]], satiation therapy (mastubatory reconditioning),&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, W.L. (1979). Satiation therapy: A procedure for reducing deviant sexual arousal. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 12, 377–389.&lt;/ref&gt; and various social skills training programs including empathy training. Current behavior analysis programs offer this type of comprehensive treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Plaud, J.J.; Muench-Plaud, D.; Kolstoe, P.D. &amp; Orveldal, L.(2000). Behavioral treatment of sexual offending behavior. ''Mental Health Aspects of Developmental Disabilities'', 3, 54–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they use a combination of functional assessment, behavior chain analysis and risk assessment to create relapse prevention strategies and to help the offender to develop better self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Vess, J. (2008). Risk formulation with sex offenders: Integrating functional analysis and actuarial measures. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(4), 28–41 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

With sex offenders who have retardation, comprehensive behavioral programming has been effective at least in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Losada-Paisey &amp; Timothy J.H. Paisey (1987). Program evaluation of a comprehensive treatment package for mentally retarded offenders. ''Behavioral Intervention'', 3(4), 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment included formal academic and vocational training, sex education, a unit [[token economy]], and individual behavior therapy including sexual reconditioning. In addition it included supported competitive employment, fading of program structure, and increased community participation.

==Journals==
There are multiple journals which produce articles on the clinical applications of [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooper, J.O.|author2=Heron, T.E.|author3=Heward, W.L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Applied behavior analysis|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular, and widely used, of these journals is the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|doi= 10.1002/(ISSN)1938-3703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many other journals dedicated to this field.  Some of these include ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', the ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'' and three new journals scheduled for release in 2008: ''Behavior Analysis in Sports, Health, Fitness and Behavioral Medicine'', ''the Journal of Behavior Analysis in Crime and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'' as well as the Association for Behavior Analysis International's ''Behavior Analysis in Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.abainternational.org/journals/behavior-analysis-in-practice.aspx | title=Behavior Analysis in Practice | publisher=abainternational.org | accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis. The Association for Behavior Analysis International has larger special interest groups for [[autism]] and [[behavioral medicine]]. The Association for Behavior Analysis International serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref name="Twyman07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassert08"/&gt; The Association for Behavior Analysis International sponsors multiple conferences/year, including the annual conference, annual autism conference, biannual international conference, and other conferences on specific issues such as behavioral theory and sustainability.

The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. In addition, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies has a special interest group on addictions.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25: [[Behavior analysis]]. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology.

'''''Reporteri''''' is a student newspaper published in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].

==History and profile==

The '''Rhodes-Livingstone Institute (RLI)''' was the first local anthropological research facility in Africa; it was founded in 1938 under the initial directorship of [[Godfrey Wilson]]. Designed to allow for easier study of the local cultures of [[Northern Rhodesia]], now [[Zambia]], it became the base of operations for a number of leading anthropologists of the time.

The RLI anthropologists have been lauded by some as liberal, anti-racists, furthering the cause of African independence. Among the participating anthropologists at the RLI, In addition to Wilson, were [[Monica Wilson|Monica Hunter Wilson]], [[Max Gluckman]], [[J. Desmond Clark]], [[Elizabeth Colson]], E.L. Epstein, [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], and William Watson.

Others have called attention to what they regard as misguidedness on the part of the RLI anthropologists, stemming from the fact that they were embedded in the colonial system and blind to its reality as a component in dialectic study.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, James. 1999, ''Expectations of Modernity'', Berkeley, LA, London. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magubane, Bernard. 1971, "A Critical Look at the Indices Used in the Study of Social Change in Colonial Africa". ''Current Anthropology''. 12(4/5): 419-445&lt;/ref&gt; For more favorable and well-supported accounts, compare the deep and detailed study by Lyn Schumaker (2001) and the shorter chapter by Richard Brown (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Schumaker, Lyn. 2001, ''Africanizing Anthropology: Fieldwork, Networks, and the Making of Cultural Knowledge In Central Africa''. Durham, London. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Richard, 1973, "Anthropology and Colonial Rule: Godfrey Wilson and the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute". In Talal Asad, ed.

The '''Science Media Centre''' is an organisation which formed in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Lancet|title=Fiona Fox|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61099-0|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61099-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
two years after the [[United Kingdom]] [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Science and Technology's third report on "Science and Society" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}

This report stated that while science was generally reported accurately in the mass media, there was a need for the promotion of more expert information at times when science is under attack in the headlines, mentioning the public reaction to GM crops, in particular.

==Functions==
In order to promote more informed science in the media, the Centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is [[Fiona Fox (UK press officer)|Fiona Fox]] who is a former member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a former contributor to its magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/farmingforthefuture | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Clear intentions | first=Peter | last=Melchett | date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The SMC's stated aim is to "facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day".

==Structure==
The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by [[Susan Greenfield]], the director of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. While the Centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.

The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at £12,500 per annum. The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the [[Research Councils UK|UK Research Councils]], government bodies, [[Quango]]s, charities, private donors and corporate bodies. For an up-to-date list of funders, see [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/funding.htm].

==Criticism==

A 2013 article in ''Nature'' stated about the SMC, "Perhaps the biggest criticism of Fox and the SMC is that they push science too aggressively — acting more as a PR agency than as a source of accurate science information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/science-media-centre-of-attention-1.13362|title=Science media: Centre of attention|year=2013|author=Nature|doi=10.1038/499142a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ronan Bennett]] and [[Alan Rusbridger]] described the SMC as a lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/02/gm.observersciencepages|title=Lobby group 'led GM thriller critics'|author=The Guardian|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SMCs==
During Professor Greenfield's term as [[Thinker in Residence]] in South Australia, a new [[Australian Science Media Centre]] was set up in [[Adelaide]], Australia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Origins|url=http://www.aussmc.org/about-us/our-origins/|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/thinkers/greenfield/impacts.aspx|title=Adelaide Thinkers in Residence - Impacts|publisher=Govt. of South Australia|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Media Centres now exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Japan, and Germany. Except for the relation between the Science Media Centre in UK and the Australian Science Media Centre, these centres are independent of each other.

'''Sociology of sociology''' is an area of [[sociology]] that combines social theories with analysis of the effect of socio-historical contexts in sociological intellectual production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} 

For the French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]], the task of the sociology of sociology is to debrief accepted truths, focusing on the questioning of canons and acting towards new epistemologies.{{r|bourdieu}} 

In his book ''A History of Sociology in Britain'', published 2004, British sociologist [[A. H. Halsey|Andrew Halsey]] outlines a sociology of sociology. He suggests a connection between political economic regimes in the 20th century and the development of sociology as an academic discipline.{{r|king}}

'''''The Godfather Effect''''' is a 2012 critically acclaimed study of the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' films - as well as [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel - and their effect on [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj ''Wall Street Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; Written by biographer [[Tom Santopietro]], the book demonstrates how ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, ''The Godfather'' changed not just the way [[Italian-Americans]] saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 83; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Godfather Effect'' had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, "what Puzo delivered - brilliantly - was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the [[American dream]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 7; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the novel, [[Amerigo Bonasera]] declares “I believe in America.” The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and [[big business]] are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 81; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Godfather Effect'' was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' declared that "part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, ''The Godfather Effect'' defines how the ''Godfather'' movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsday]]'' appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, "In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of ''The Godfather Effect'', but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/the-godfather-effect-by-tom-santopietro-1.3552803 Newsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York Journal of Books'' found that Santopietro “capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/godfather-effect-changing-hollywood-america-and-me ''New York Journal of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was recognized for its historical value by ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'', the official publication of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html ''Smithsonian Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79533">A '''tonary''' is a [[liturgical book]] in the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] Church which lists by [[incipit]] various items of [[Gregorian chant]] according to the [[Gregorian mode]] (''tonus'') of their melodies within the eight-mode system. Tonaries often include [[Canonical hours|Office]] [[antiphon]]s, the mode of which determines the recitation formula for the accompanying text (the [[psalm tone]] if the antiphon is sung with a psalm, or canticle tone if the antiphon is sung with a [[canticle]]), but a tonary may also or instead list [[Responsory|responsories]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] chants not associated with formulaic recitation. Although some tonaries are stand-alone works, they were frequently used as an appendix to other liturgical books such as [[Antiphonary|antiphonaries]], [[gradual]]s, [[trope (music)|tropers]], and [[troper-proser|prosers]], and are often included in collections of musical treatises.

== Function and form ==
[[File:Tonary fragment of Saint-Riquier.jpg|thumb|500px|left|The earliest Tonary: the fragment of Saint-Riquier ([[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Riquier|13159, fol. 167r]])]]

Tonaries were particularly important as part of the written transmission of plainchant, although they already changed the oral chant transmission of Frankish cantors entirely before [[musical notation]] was used systematically in fully notated chant books.&lt;ref&gt;The modal patterns, memorized by a short formula, and the deductive classification of chant played an active part in the process of oral transmission, so Anna Maria Busse Berger dedicated a whole chapter of her book ([[#Bus05|2005, pp. 47-84]]) to the tonary, in which she described the relationship between music and the medieval art of memory.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Carolingian reform the ordering according to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Synthesis in Latin music theory|Octoechos]] assisted the memorization of chant. The exact order was related to the elements of the "tetrachord of the finales" (D—E—F—G) which were called "Protus, Deuterus, Tritus", and "Tetrardus". Each of them served as the finalis of two toni—the "authentic" (ascending into the higher octave) and the "plagal" one (descending into the lower fourth). The eight tones were ordered in these pairs: "Autentus protus, Plagi Proti, Autentus Deuterus" etc. Since [[Hucbald]] of Saint-Amand the eight tones were simply numbered according to this order: Tonus I-VIII. [[#Aquitanian cantors|Aquitanian cantors]] usually used both names for each section.

The earliest tonaries, written during the 8th century, were very short and simple without any visible reference to psalmody. Tonaries of the 9th century already ordered a huge repertoire of psalmodic chant into sections of psalmtone endings, even if their melody was not indicated or indicated by later added neumes.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. a tonary added to Aurelian's theoretical one in a manuscript of the Abbey Saint-Amand ([[:fr:Bibliothèque_municipale_classée#Nord-Pas-de-Calais|F-VAL]] [[#AurTo|148]])—an important centre of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], has some intonation formulas in later added Paleofrankish neumes.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tonaries which have survived until now can be dated back to the 11th and 12th centuries, while some were written during later centuries, especially in Germany.

The treatise form usually served as a bridge between the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Latin reception|Octoechos]] theory and the daily practice of prayer: memorizing and performing the liturgy as chant and reciting the [[psalms]]. This can be studied at a 10th-century treatise called ''[[#Com84|Commemoratio brevis de tonis et psalmis modulandis]]'', which used the Dasia-signs of the ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]'' treatise (9th century) in order to transcribe the melodic endings or terminations of psalmody.&lt;ref&gt;An early copy of the ''Commemoratio brevis'' in a music theory collection written about 1000 ([[Bamberg State Library|D-BAs]] [[#CommWerden|Var.1]]). A list of the sources can be found here: {{cite web|title=Commemoratio brevis|url=http://www.musicologie.org/sites/c/commemoratio_brevis.html|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11th-century theorists like [[Guido of Arezzo]] (''Regulae rhythmicae'') or [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (''Musica'') refused the Dasia tone system, because it displayed tetraphonic tone system and not the systema teleion (corresponding to the white keys of the keyboard) which had all the pitches needed for the "melos of the echoi" (''ex sonorum copulatione'' in "Musica enchiriadis", ''emmelis sonorum'' in the compilation "alia musica").&lt;ref&gt;Both systems were used by Byzantine psaltes and among them the former was never expected to contain all the degrees of the mode, as they were used "in the melos of the echoi".&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the first example of the eighth chapter in ''Musica enchiriadis'', called "Quomodo ex quatuor Sonorum vi omnes toni producantur", already used the fifth of the Protus (D—a) for an illustration, how alleluia melodies are developed by the use of the intonation formula for the "Autentus protus".&lt;ref&gt;See the copy from the Abbey St. Emmeram ([[Bavarian State Library|D-Mbs]] [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00034237/image_157 clm 14272, fol.156]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The different forms of a tonary ===
Tonaries can differ substantially in length and shape:

* As a treatise they usually describe the octave, fifth and fourth species of each tone, but also their modal characteristics like microtonal shifts or the change to another melodic frame.
* It can also be an abridged form or [[breviary]], which just show the [[sacramentary]] (for mass chants) or antiphonary (for the office chant of the Vigils and the Hours) according to the liturgical year. The tonus of the antiphonal chant genres is indicated by later added rubrics as "ATe" for "Autentus Tetrardus" (see the [[#Carolingian_tonaries_and_gradual-sacramentaries_.288th.E2.80.939th_century.29|Gradual-Sacramentaries]] of Corbie and Saint-Denis) or the Roman Ordinals I-VIII according to Hucbald's system, as we can find it in the early Troper-Sequentiary of St. Géraud in Aurillac ([[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1084|1084]]) and the abridged Antiphonary of St. Martial ([[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1085|1085]]).
* The most common form was the shortest one which had no theoretical explanation. Since the late 9th century each section started with an intonation formula and the [[psalmody]] of the mode, its pitches represented by letters or later by diastematic neume notation. Subsections followed the different chant genres quoted as examples for the represented tone. Antiphonal refrains in psalm recitation (''antiphons'' like [[introit]]s and [[communion (chant)|communiones]]), usually represented by its text incipit, were sorted according to various terminations used in psalmody, the so-called "differentiae".&lt;ref&gt;The practice of ''differentiae'', terminations which were also called "divisio, diffinitio", or "formula", corresponded to the melodic beginning of the antiphons and was developed during the later 9th century. Hence, the different terminations of psalmody became a subsection of each section dedicated to the antiphons of the mass or the nocturn. There are tonaries which exemplified the whole psalmody with the small doxology ("Gloria patri") written out with neumes or letters (see the Dasia-signs used in [[Bamberg State Library|D-BAs]] [[#CommWerden|Var.1]]), but there was also the abridged form to notate just the termination over the vowels EVOVAE of the last six syllables: "seculorum. Amen." Often the eight sections for the eight tones were repeated for other chant genres without psalmody or different chant books as gradual and antiphonary (Responsories, Alleluia, Offertories etc.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A very rare form of tonary is a fully notated one, which shows every chant genre (not only the antiphonal ones with [[psalmody]] as [[introit]] and [[Communion (chant)|communio]] of the proper mass) ordered according to its tonus. A very famous example is the [[Antiphonary of St. Benigne, Dijon|full tonary]] for mass chant by Abbot [[William of Volpiano]], written for his Abbey St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] ([[:fr:Faculté de médecine de Montpellier|F-MOf]] [[#MOfH159|H.159]]).

=== The tonary's function in chant transmission ===
During the Carolingian reform the tonary played a key role in the organization and the transfer of Roman chant, which had to be sung by Frankish cantors according to Charlemagne's ''admonitio generalis'' after it was decreed in 789. The historical background was the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 during which [[Pope Adrian I]] accepted the Eastern [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|Octoechos]] reform also for the Roman church. Fully notated neume manuscripts like the [[gradual]] and the [[antiphonary]] were written much later during the last decades of the 10th century, and the oral transmission of Gregorian chant is only testified by additions of neumes in [[Sacramentary|sacramentaries]]. In the tonary the whole repertory of "Gregorian chant" was ordered according to its modal classification of the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|Octoechos]].

Michel Huglo developed in his dissertation the hypothesis about an original tonary which preceded the [[#Metz|Metz tonary]] and the [[#Riquier|tonary of St. Riquier]].&lt;ref&gt;Huglo ([[#Hug71|1971]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably a coincidence, that Pope Adrian I supported the Eastern Octoechos reform, but it is also evident that Carolingian diplomates present at the synode did not get interest in the communication of the modes by intonations called ''enechemata'' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;In a long essay dedicated to the Latin treatises and the knowledge that Latin cantors had about music theory, Michel Huglo ([[#Hug00|2000]]) referred to an episode of a Byzantine legacy in Aachen, who celebrated troparia (processional antiphons) for the feast of Epiphany. Oliver Strunk ([[#Str60|1960]]) had already published about this visit, but through Walter Berschin's essays about the Carolingian visits of Byzantine legacies Michel Huglo became convinced that this exchange could already have happened before his self-nomination as an Emperor of both Roman Empires.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was the difference between Greek and Latin chant sources and especially the particular function of the tonary in chant transmission, which led Peter Jeffery to the conclusion, that the huge repertoire of Roman chant was classified according to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|Octoechos]] a posteriori.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001]]).&lt;/ref&gt; While early manuscripts of Greek chant always used modal signatures (even before neume notation was used), the fully notated [[gradual]]s and [[Antiphonary|antiphonaries]] of the first generation (10th century), written by Frankish cantors, report a lot of details about accentuation and ornamentation, but the melodic structure was remembered orally by tropes. Sometimes a tonary was attached to these manuscripts, and the cantors could use it by looking for the incipit of an antiphon in question (e.g. an [[introit]] to  [[Communion (chant)|communio]]), in order to find the right psalmody according to the mode and the melodic ending of the antiphon, which was sung as a refrain during the recitation of the psalm. A Greek psaltes would sing a completely different melody according to the echos indicated by the modal signature, while Frankish cantors had to remember the melody of a certain Roman chant, before they communicated their idea of its mode and its psalmody in a tonary—for all the cantors who will follow them. In this complex process of chant transmission, which followed Charlemagne's reform, the so-called "Gregorian chant" or Franco-Roman chant, as it was written down about 150 years after the reform, was born.

The tonary's function within chant transmission explains, why local schools of Latin chant can be studied by their tonary. Hence, the tonary was still substantial for every chant reform between the 10th and the 12th centuries, like the reform of the Cluniac Monastic Association (tonaries of [[#Aquitanian Cantors|Aquitania]], [[#Parisian &amp; Cluniac Cantors|Paris]], and [[Fleury Abbey|Fleury]],&lt;ref&gt;The impact of the Cluniac Monastic Association on these reforms was often considered, neglected, and re-considered by various musicologists. Background was a discussion among historians around a book of Dominique Iogna-Prat, which was originally published in French in 1998 (see the English translation by Graham Robert Edwards: {{Cite book

}}). The answer of the musicologist's question concerning the centre of the Aquitanian school laid simply there. Rather lately ([[#Gil06|2006]]) Bryan Gillingham tried a general study of the role that Cluny played in the written chant transmission between the 11th and the 13th century. Already in  [[#Cha85|1985]] [[Jacques Chailley]] studied an allegorical sculpture in the sanctuary of [[Cluny Abbey]] which is an important monument of the Cluniac approach to the tonary and its eight-mode system, according to him the sanctuary with the sculpture was inaugurated by [[Pope Urban II]].&lt;/ref&gt; but also in Northern Spain&lt;ref&gt;The Taifa kingdom Toledo, an important domaine of the [[Mozarabic rite]], was conquered by the Castilian King Alfonso VI in 1085. After he gave his daughters in marriage to Aquitanian und Burgundian aristocrats, the Council of Burgos had already decreed the introduction of the [[Roman rite]] in 1080. Hence, reforms can be studied by the distribution of Aquitanian manuscripts in Spain. See also the study of chant manuscripts by Manuel Ferreira ([[#Fer07|2007]]).&lt;/ref&gt;), the reform of a monastic orders like the one around [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for the Cistercians ([[#Cistercian Cantors|Tonale Sci Bernardi]]), a papal reform, like Abbot Desiderius realized at the Abbey [[Montecassino]] ([[#MC318|Tonary of Montecassino]]), or the reform of some monasteries of a certain region, as Abbot [[William of Volpiano]] did for certain Abbeys in Burgundy and Normandy (William of Volpiano's [[#Norman cantors|Toner-Gradual and Antiphonary]]).

== The Carolingian names or "Byzantine" intonations for the 8 tones ==
In Carolingian times each of the eight sections was opened by an intonation formula using the names like "Nonannoeane" for the authentic and "Noeagis" or "Noeais" for the plagal tones. In the living traditions of Orthodox chant, these formulas were called "enechemata" and they were used by a protopsaltes to communicate the basis tone for the ison-singers (a kind of bordun) as well as the first note of the chant for the other singers.&lt;ref&gt;It is not easy to prove this or another practice for medieval chant, neither for Greek nor for Latin singers, but concerning performance practice this is quite a controversial topic which is solved in different ways. It is possible that the Orthodox practice today helps the singers to sing subtle intonation changes, which are no longer practiced in Western music, while maqam singers usually sing without ison. It is as well possible to perform ''florid organa'' in a monodic way without the ''cantus'' in the tenor as a second voice.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his theoretical tonary "Musica disciplina", [[Aurelian of Réôme]] asked  a Greek about the meaning of the intonation syllables used in Latin tonaries:
{{cquote|Caeterum nomina, quae ipsis inscribuntur tonis, ut est in primo tono Nonaneane, et in secundo Noeane, et caetera quaeque, moveri solet animus, quid in se contineant significationis? Etenim quemdam interrogavi graecum, in latina quid interpretarentur lingua? respondit, se nihil interpretari, sed esse apud eos laetantis adverbia: quantoque maior est vocis concentus, eo plures inscribuntur syllabae: ut in authento proto, qui principium est, sex inseruntur syllabae, videlicet hae Noeane Nonannoeane; in authentu deuteri: in authentu triti, quoniam minoris sunt metri, quinque tantummodo eis inscribuntur syllabae, ut est Noioeane. In plagis autem eorum consimilis est litteratura, scilicet Noeane, sive secundum quosdam Noeacis. Memoratus denique adiunxit graecus, huiusmodi, inquiens, nostra in lingua videntur habere consimilitudinem, qualem arantes sive angarias minantes exprimere solent, excepto quod haec laetantis tantummodo sit vox, nihilque aliud exprimentis, estque tonorum in se continens modulationem.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelianus Reomensis: "Musica disciplina" ([[#Aur84|Gerbert 1784]], p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;My mind was usually moved by some of the names, which were inscribed for the tones, as "Nonan[no]eane" for the protus, and "Noeane" for the deuterus. Did they have any significance? So I asked a Greek, how these could be translated into Latin. He answered that they did not mean anything, but they were rather expressions of joy. And the greater the harmony of the voice, the more syllables were inscribed to the tone: as in the "authentus protus" which was the first, they used six syllables as "No[neno]eane" or "Nonannoeane"; for "authentus tritus", which was smaller in measure [not so much worth], five syllables as "Noioeane" were inscribed. In plagal tones the letters were similar to "Noeane", as "Noeacis" according to them. When I asked him, if there might be something similar in our language, the Greek added, that I should rather think of something expressed by charioteers or ploughing peasants, when their voice had nothing else than this joy. The same contained the modulation of the tones [during their intonation].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The practice of using abstract syllables for the intonation, as it was common for the use of ''enechemata'' among Byzantine psaltes, was obviously not familiar to Aurelian of Réôme.&lt;ref&gt;It was a coincidence that Carolingian cantors used more syllables for the ''Autentus protus'', like the ''[[enechema]]'' of the echos protos as it was used by Greek psaltes (see [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#protos|Octoechos]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably imported by a Byzantine legacy, when they introduced the Greek [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|Octoechos]] by a series of procession antiphons used for the feast of Epiphany.&lt;ref&gt;Huglo ([[#Hug00|2000]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Latin names were not identical, there is some resemblance between the intonation formula of the echos plagios tetartos νὲ ἅγιε and the Latin name "Noeagis", used as a general name for all four plagal tones. But there are some more obvious cases as particular names like "Aianeoeane" (enechema of the Mesos Tetartos) or "Aannes" (enechema of the echos varys) which can be found in very few tonaries between Liège, Paris, Fleury, and Chartres. Two of these tonaries have treatises and use a lot of Greek terms taken from Ancient Greek theory.&lt;ref&gt;For example in the 11th-century treatise compilation "[[#AliaHartvic|alia musica]]" ([[#Cha65|Chailley 1965]], "AIANEOEANE": p.141; "AANNES": p.160), and some tonaries are of particular interest as Hartvic's copy of the [[#Regensburg|Chartres tonary]] and the [[#Reichenau2|second tonary of the Troper-Sequentiary of Reichenau]], which uses "ANANEAGIES" for the "Autenticus Protus" and "AIANEAGIES" for the "Autenticus Deuterus". Unlike the Guidonian concept of "b fa", the plagios tritos which was called ''echos varys'' ("grave mode") by Greek psaltes, did not avoid the tritone to the ''basis'' and ''finalis'' F. The pure fourth was only used by the enharmonic [[Nana (echos)|phthora nana]]. According to Oliver Gerlach ([[#Ger12|2012]]) the very sophisticated intonation of the diatonic Mesos Tetartos, known by the name ἅγια νεανὲ among Greek psaltes, was imitated by Latin cantors for certain phrygian compositions of the Gregorian repertory, among them the Communio ''Confessio et pulchritudo''. Michel Huglo ([[#HugNG|NGrove]]) classified these tonaries as "transitional group" which he dated already to the 10th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The later practice of the intonation verses ==

The oldest tonaries, especially the Carolingian like those of [[#Riquier|St. Riquier]], [[#Metz|Metz]], [[#Reichenau|Reichenau]] and the earliest tonary in a troper of Limoges (F-Pn lat. [[#Pbn1240|1240]]), only used the so-called "Byzantine" intonation formulas, as they were discussed by [[Aurelian of Réôme]] ([[#Aur84|Musica disciplina]]), [[Regino of Prüm]] ([[#Reg76|Tonarius]]), and [[Berno of Reichenau]] ([[#BernoTonar|Tonarium]]).&lt;ref&gt;The verses inserted before the tonary of Reichenau are obviously a later addition:

}} This version has very elaborated ''neumae'' after each verse.&lt;/ref&gt; But since the 10th century, also biblical verses were used. They were composed together in one antiphon with each verse changing the tone and referring to the number of the tonus according to the system of [[Hucbald]] (''Tonus primus, secundus, terius'' etc.), similar to [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s use of the [[Guidonian hand|solmization]] hymn "[[Ut queant laxis]]". They were several different antiphons as they can be found in the [[#Hartker1|Hartker-Antiphonary]] or the treatise collection of Montecassino (Ms. Q318, p.&amp;nbsp;122-125), but no one became so popular than a compilation of verses taken from the New Testament which started with "Primum querite regnum dei".&lt;ref&gt;A list of a lot of tonaries which use these verses, can be found here:

|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually each verse is finished by a long melisma or ''neuma'' which clearly show its potential to become a tool of improvisation and composition as well. The origin of these verses is unknown. In some tonaries, they replaced the Carolingian intonations as in the [[#BernoTonar|tonary by Berno of Reichenau]], but more often they were written under them or alternated with them in the subsections like in a certain group which Michel Huglo ([[#Hug71|1971]]) called the "Toulouse tonaries" (F-Pn lat. [[#Pbn776|776]], [[#Pbn1118|1118]], [[British Library|GB-Lbl]] Ms. [[#Har4951|Harley 4951]]), but also in the [[#MC318|tonary of Montecassino]]. Concerning the earliest fully notated chant manuscripts, it seems that the practice of singing the intonation formulas was soon replaced by another practice, that a soloist intoned the beginning of an [[antiphon]], [[responsorium]], or [[alleluia]], and after this "incipit" of the soloist the choir continued. These changes between precantor and choir were usually indicated by an asterisk or by the use of maiuscula at the beginning the chant text. The psalmody could be indicated by an incipit of the required psalm and the ''differentia'' notated over the syllables EVOVAE after the [[communion (chant)|communio]] or [[introit]] antiphon.

== Cross-references between tonaries during the reforms between the 10th and the 13th centuries ==
Nevertheless, the tonary was not replaced by these manuscripts. While the first generation of notated manuscripts became less and less readable until the end of the 10th century, the production of tonaries as useful appendix highly increased, especially in Aquitania, the Loire valley (Île-de-France) and Burgundy. Probably the oral tradition of the melody was no longer properly working since the early 11th century, or there was still a need in a lot of regions to teach certain cantors an unknown tradition, or the tradition itself had to change under certain innovations of cantors who were in charge of an institutional reform. Studies of the reforms of various regions in Spain, Germany, Italy, and France have found evidence for all these cases whatever was the centre of each reform which had taken place between the late 10th and the 12th centuries. The monk Hartvic added some Dasia signs for certain ''differentiae'' as a kind of rubric or comment on the margin ([[#Regensburg|Tonary of St. Emmeram]], Regensburg). He knew them from the treatises ''Musica'' and ''Scholica enchiriadis'' which he copied in this manuscript, and thus he discovered a new way of using them: as an additional explanation or second pitch notation interpreting the adiastematic neumes.

=== The Cluniac reforms and the counter-reforms ===

During the late 10th and the 11th century, the early use of a second alphabetical pitch notation was soon replaced by a new diastematic form of neume notation, which indicated the pitch by the vertical position of the neumes, while their groups indicated by ligatures were still visible. Aquitanian and English cantors in Winchester were the first who developed a diastematic form, which could be written in such an analytical way.

==== William of Volpiano and the Norman line ====
[[William of Volpiano]] elaborated the concept of an additional letter notation and created a new form of tonary which became an important part of his monastic reforms, he did the first reform for [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], after he became abbot of St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] in Burgundy. Since 1001 he changed to the [[Abbey of Fécamp]], after he was asked by the [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Norman Duke Richard II]] to guide secular and monastic reforms in the Duchy of Normandy.

The [[Tonary of St. Bénigne, Dijon|fully notated tonary]] which he wrote for [[Benignus of Dijon|St. Benignus]] ([[#MOfH159|F-MOf H159]]), is following the order of other tonaries, which were created under the influence of the [[Cluniac reforms|Cluniac Monastic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cluniac reforms can be verified in tonaries written in [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] and [[Fleury Abbey]], certain Abbeys around Paris as [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], but also in Burgundy and Aquitaine. The creativity of Aquitanian cantors played a key role concerning the Cluniac needs for an extravagant liturgy. Hence, it is hardly surprising that they were more productive concerning tonaries than any other local school in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; These tonaries usually had sections dedicated to the [[antiphonary]] and the [[Roman gradual|gradual]], within the gradual and the antiphonary there were subsections like the [[antiphon]]s which were sung as refrains during psalm recitation ([[introit]]s and [[communion (chant)|communions]]), [[Responsory|responsories]] (the introduction of epistle readings), but also other genres of the proper mass chant as [[alleluia]] verses (the introduction of gospels), and [[Offertory|offertories]] (a soloistic processional antiphon for the procession of the gifts). Several Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries had a libellum structure which sorted the genres in separate books like alleluia verses (as the first part of [[Sequence (poetry)|sequentiaries]] and [[tract (liturgy)|tractus]] collections), [[Offertory|offertorials]], and [[Trope (music)|tropers]]. But William of Volpiano subdivided these books into eight parts according to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Tonary|octoechos]] system like the tonary, or the troparia in the Byzantine book [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]], and within these sections the chant was ordered according to the cycle of the liturgical year starting with advent. He used the neumes of Cluny, the central French forms, without changing them, but he added an [[Antiphonary of St. Benigne, Dijon#The alphabetic notation invented by William of Volpiano|own system of alphabetic notation]] in a second row, which defined the pitches of the melody precisely according to the Boethian diagramm.&lt;ref&gt;See Huglo's study of this particular tonary ([[#Hug56|1956]]). Including the enharmonic diesis which were represented by signs as "Τ" for ''E diesis'', "Γ" for ''b diesis'', and the last sign written from the right to the left for ''a diesis'' (see the figure in the [[Antiphonary of St. Benigne, Dijon#The alphabetic notation invented by William of Volpiano|main article]]). The Boethian diagramm was already used since centuries, with exception of the symbols of the tetraphonic Dasia system which were used in certain treatises since the ''Musica'' and ''Scolica enchiriadis'' ([[#Phi00|Phillips 2000]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Like any other chant manuscript around 1000, the book was not written for a use during a ceremony, it was a "book of memory" for cantors who alone had the competence of reading and writing neumes, and the responsibility to organize the chant sung during the liturgical year. During his reforms, several Abbeys followed his example and his system was used by the teachers of the local grammar schools which included the daily practice of singing the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Publications du CRAHM | isbn = 978-2-902685-61-5 | last = Gazeau | first = Véronique |author2=Monique Goullet  | title = Guillaume de Volpiano.

William's reform and its monastic foundations of [[Abbey of Fécamp|Fécamp]] and the construction of the Abbey on the island of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] were not the first, and there were a lot of later abbots who founded monasteries not only in Normandy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}  Olivier Diard's study ([[#Dia00|2000]]) of a late copy of his tonary and antiphonary for the [[Abbey of Fécamp]] (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 254, olim A.190) emphasized that William of Volpiano had not only introduced customs of Saint Bénigne and own compositions — as it was common among Cluniac reformers — in Normandy, but he also integrated and reinforced Norman customs by his school.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in the conquered territories of Northern, and Southern Italy, including [[Emirate of Sicily|Arabian Sicily]], after the [[Norman Sicily|Norman Kingdom]] was established in the conquered Island. His fully notated tonaries were only copied in Brittany and Normandy, the Norman-Sicilian manuscripts rather imitated the libellum structure of the Aquitanian troper-sequentiaries, and only a few of them ([[Biblioteca Nacional de España|E-Mn]] [[#Mn288|288]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#lat10508|10508]]) have survived with a tonary using central French neume notation, in its style very close to the chant books of Cluny.&lt;ref&gt;About the Sicilian origin of the tonary in the Troper-Proser of the Saint-Évroult Abbey, see Shin Nishimagi ([[#Nis08|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The «Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin» still conserves the only manuscript with alphabetic notation which can be dated back to William's time. Thanks to the creative and innovative achievements of William as a cantor, reformer and architect, the local monasteries which he reformed, did not simply adapt to customs of the Cluniac reform, he contributed to the history of Norman chant his own local school which was as well inspired by elements of the local [[Normans|Norman]] tradition as by innovations of the Cluniac reform.

==== The Aquitanian tonaries and the Winchester Troper ====
The Aquitanian innovation can be traced back to a very prominent cantor within the Cluniac reforms: [[Adémar de Chabannes]] was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes at the Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges and this school redacted the first chant manuscripts by additional modal signatures and a remarkable production of tonaries, which Michel Huglo called the "Saint-Martial group" or the monastic tonaries of Aquitaine. Adémar was the next generation after William of Volpiano and he was one of the first notators who used the diastematic form of Aquitanian neume notation, which had already been developed during the late 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;In his monographical study ([[#Gri06|2006]]) James Grier regard two manuscripts ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn909|909]] and [[#Pbn1121|1121]]) as documents of Adémar's work as a cantor and notator. Both of them have a tonary which offer insights to the modal framework of Adémar's school according to the local concept of the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Tonary|octoechos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tonary corpus of the same region was Huglo's "Toulouse groupe" around the [[#Har4951|Gradual]] of the [[Toulouse Cathedral|Saint-Étienne cathedral]] in Toulouse ([[British Library|GB-Lbl]] Ms. [[#Har4951|Harley 4951]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1118|1118]], and [[#Pbn776|776]]). All of these books of the local secular cathedral rite have a tonary libellum. The oldest one is the Troper Sequentiary of the Auch region ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|F-Pn]] lat. [[#Pbn1118|1118]]) which was probably written in Limoges by the end of the 10th century. The intonation of the "plagi protus" (on folio 105 verso) is rather exposing the melos used in [[Old Roman chant]] of this tone (ranging between C and G), but the sequentiary (folio 114 recto) is opened by an "improvised" alleluia of the same tone simply made by a similar intonation which is also using the plagal fourth A-D under the final note D according to the Carolingian concept of the plagal mode. On folio 131 verso there is another alleluia made of the same intonation, but here the same intonation is rather artificially cut into segments for the words of the sequence «Almifona». Here, the improvised melodic structure developed by a repetitive use of the intonation formula had turned into a sophisticated composition which dealt with the syllables of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8432314k/f272.image folio 131 verso] of the Troper Sequentiary. Jørgen Raasted ([[#Raa88|1988]]) and Oliver Gerlach ([[#GSt11|2011]], pp. 22-24) emphasized this creative or poetic function in their description of Western and Eastern intonation formulas.&lt;/ref&gt;

A central line, usually on F or G, was added and helped to recognize their horizontal organization, during the 12th century a second line was added until they were replaced by a pentagramm in square notation by the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Already the ''[[Musica enchiriadis|Musica]]'' and ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]'' (9th century) used rows defined by Dasian signs, and placed the syllables of the chant text according to the pitches sung with them. The odd tone system was a repetition of four tetrachord elements represented by four signs which were obviously taken from the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos]] and Greek tetraphonic tone system: ''protus, deuterus, tritus,'' and ''tetrardus''. These four Dasian signs and their derivations were used in a lot of tonaries. The innovation of the 10th century was the design of neumes which were so detailed, that they kept plenty of information concerning ornaments and accents. Rebecca Maloy ([[#Mal09|2009]]) even assumed that the use of transposition (mentioned as "absonia" in ''Scolica enchiriadis'') might be found behind the diastematic Aquitanian neume notation—an assumption which clearly illustrates the weak side of [[Adémar de Chabannes|Adémar]]'s notation in comparison with the letter notation invented by [[William of Volpiano]], which came never in use outside Normandy. Until this time very complex modal structures and microtonal shifts could be notated, as Maloy demonstrated by the most complex example of written transmission: the notation of the soloistic chant genre [[offertory]]. But Western notation did never develop modal signatures and the melodic structure was directly deduced by the diastematic notation. A second radical simplification became necessary, and so [[solmization]] was invented by [[Guido of Arezzo]]. On the background of his innovation, the later square notation was rather a reduction of the neume ligatures to a pure pitch notation, their performance was changed radically by an oral tradition of singing ornaments, of performing ligatures in a rhythmic way, and of more or less primitive models of polyphony which was no longer visible in the chant books of the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Aquitanian cantors the network of the [[Cluniac reforms|Cluniac Monastic Association]] was not only a problematic accumulation of political power during the crusades among aristocratic churchmen, which caused rebellions in several Benedictine monasteries and the foundation of new anti-Cluniac reform orders, they also cultivated new forms of chant performance which dealt with poetry, and polyphony like ''discantus'' and ''organum''. They were used in all possible combinations which turned improvisation into composition, and composition into improvisation. The imitation of these forms in Spain, and Italy were caused by papal reforms which tried to organize the church provinces in newly conquered territories or territories which conserved older rites, because reforms could hardly be established for a long time.

The diastematic notation of Aquitanian cantors and their most innovative use in tropes and punctum contra punctum polyphony which can be also found in the [[Chartres cathedral]], the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Fossés near Paris, and [[Fleury Abbey]], also influenced the [[Winchester troper]] (see its [[#WinTr|tonary]]), the earliest and hugest collection of early [[organum]] or [[discant]]us. Since 1100, the florid organum reproduced the original function of the earlier intonation formula as it can be found in the tonaries. An initial ornament called ''principium ante principium'' ("beginning before the beginning") in the [[Notre Dame school]] allowed the solistic organum singer to indicate the basis degree of the cantus by an individual intonation in the higher octave, while the finale octave of each section was prepared by an paenultima ornament, which had developed by the "meeting" (''occursus'') of chant and organum voice.

==== Tonaries of the reform orders ====
During this long period Cluny's power and influence on less and less successful crusades which were well reflected in certain chant genres like conductus and motet, caused a decline and an increasing resistance among the monastic communities of the Cluniac Association between Paris, Burgundy, Île-de-France, and Aquitaine. New monastic orders were founded in order to establish anti-Cluniac counter-reforms. The most important was certainly created among Cistercians by a reform group around [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;A list of the sources can be found in Christian Meyer's essay ([[#Mey03|2003]]) who also described the characteristics of Cistercian tonaries and the various redactions of Bernard of Clairvaux's preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The innovations and corrections of Roman-Frankish chant during the [[Cluniac reforms]] were disregarded as a corruption of the Roman tradition, but the new books ordered from the scriptoria of Laon and Metz did not satisfy the expectations of the reformers. Instead rules based on [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s ''[[Micrologus]]'' were codified to support the Cistercian cantors, while they were cleaning the corrupted tradition of plainchant.&lt;ref&gt;His prologue and treatise of the chant reform have survived in the 13th-century [[#Rein|Antiphoner of Rein (fol. Ir-IIIr)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite certain ambitions concerning the performance practice of polyphonic organum, the first generation of reformers around Bernard did not allow these Cluniac practices.&lt;ref&gt;Part of a 15th-century chant treatise about improvised polyphony was once attributed to Limoges, later it was identified as an appendix to Abbot Guido's ''Regulae'' about habits of the Cistercian rite ([[#Swe92|Sweeney 1992]]). The edition of Ms. 2284 [[Sainte-Geneviève Library|Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève]] ([[#GuiEu|Coussemaker]], [[#Swe89|Sweeney]]) has been revised recently by an edition ([[#Mey09|Meyer 2009]]) based on four other sources. According to Christian Meyer there was no explicit rule in the treatise which excluded polyphonic performances of plainchant from the Cistercian rite, despite the fact, that reform orders had been founded with monks, who had left their former monastic communities, after a Cluniac abbot had taken over and changed the local rite with new practices including polyphonic performance ([[organum|“cum organo”]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they were established soon, as Bernard became one of the most important and powerful churchman involved in crusade policies which clearly corresponded to the refused aristocratic ambitions within the Cluniac Association. During Bernard's liturgical reform the tonary still served as an important tool and its modal patterns formed the basis of the corrections made by [[#Cistercian_Cantors|Cistercian cantors]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Christian Meyer ([[Tonary#ToC|2003]]) the tonary in the Milanese Antiphonary of the Abbey St. Mary of Morimondo is one of the most complete sources which is very close to those used in the Cistercian foundations in Austria, Germany, and Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The tonaries in Italy ===
The local liturgical traditions in large parts of Italy remained stable, because there was simply no written transmission which could interfere with any reform until the end of the 10th century. A lot of local neumes used by [[Beneventan chant|Beneventan]] and [[Old Roman chant|Old Roman]] notators already started in a diastematic form, and the local scribes used the same opportunity to codify their own tradition, and in a second step of a reform which could not earlier be realized until a political conquest allowed the domination of a certain region, they had to deal with a codified chant repertory which was supposed to be "Roman". The transfer was done by written transmission, and this explains certain cross-references which can be studied in detail by the notated chant repertory, but more easily by the copies and the local neumes used in tonaries.

From this point of view, several tonaries, already transmitted by earlier French sources, can be found in later copies in Italian manuscripts, often written in French scriptoria and their [[neume]] notation. Nevertheless, a lot of Italian cantors were authors of tonaries which played a key role during Carolingian, Cluniac, and anti-Cluniac reforms in France and Lake Constance. As example, [[William of Volpiano]] from Piedmont, [[Guido of Arezzo]], whose treatises were used during the Cistercian and Beneventan reform, while there is no source which testify the use of tonaries among Roman cantors. The famous ''Dialogus'', falsely ascribed to [[Odo of Cluny]], the second Abbot of [[Cluny Abbey]], was compiled in the province of Milan, while only "Formulas quas vobis", a tonary used in Montecassino and Southern Italy, was written by another [[Odo of Arezzo|Odo]], Abbot of Arezzo.

Older traditions like [[Old Roman chant|Old-Roman]], [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]], as well as [[Beneventan chant|Old-Beneventan]] manuscripts follow own modal patterns which are not identical with those of "[[Gregorian chant]]", i.e. the Roman-Frankish redaction between the first generation of fully notated manuscripts (since the 1050s), the [[Tonary#Parisian .26 Cluniac Cantors|Cluniac reforms]] (11th century), and the "Neo-Gregorian reforms" of the late 11th and 12th centuries in centres like [[#MC318|Montecassino and Benevento]],&lt;ref&gt;The term "repertorio neo-gregoriano" is taken from Luisa Nardini who also studied the Montecassino tonary and its role in the transmission of the Mass repertory ([[#Nar03|Nardini 2003]]).&lt;/ref&gt; or in reform orders like [[#Cistercian_Cantors|Cistercians]] or [[#Dominican_Cantors|Dominicans]] etc. The [[#Mn288|Norman-Sicilian]] tonary shows a great resemblance with manuscripts written in [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]].

[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Sarah Bernhardt]] as [[Hamlet]]]]

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''troop density''' ({{lang-ru|Плотность войск}}) also known as the ''dispersion factor'' in [[military science]] is a [[Statistics#Experimental and observational studies|statistical value]] assigned by commanders during the [[combat operations process]] in considering the ability of the [[Combat Arms]] to achieve [[Goal|military objectives]] during a [[military operation]]. It reflects [[combat readiness]] of the [[unit (military)|units]] to participate in [[engagement (military)|engagements]] with consideration to the [[Tactical Area of Responsibility|terrain]] and expected enemy strength.

The [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is square metres per [[soldier]], although this is modified for each combat arm to reflect their primary [[weapon performance]] in combat as [[weapon density]] ({{lang-ru|Плотность оружия}});&lt;ref&gt;cf.p.243, Naveh&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[artillery|guns]] for artillery.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; Troop density is also used to [[Intelligence analysis|estimate]] forces required to occupy a given populated territory in order to deny this population to being exploited by the enemy [[Covert operation|covert forces]] or insurgent troops.&lt;ref&gt;p.16, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

The troop density has decreased through [[military history]] in proportion to the increase in [[weapon lethality|lethality of weapons]] being use in combat.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no accepted standard to calculate this value due to the large number of variables involved in the planning of combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;p.93, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

Military history can be divided into three periods according to ''average troop density'' employed in [[combat]]: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of [[close order formation]] armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per [[infantryman]], and the [[Second World War]] when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per [[infantryman]].&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Army]] has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of troop density, including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations.&lt;ref&gt;for example during strategic offensives to liberate Poland, p.295, Chaney&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Cold War]] the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per [[infantryman]] due to widespread [[mechanised infantry|mechanisation]] of forces.&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt;

Troop density was included in the [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] of the [[First World War]] belligerents, based on the [[battalion]] per [[forward zone]] front calculation.&lt;ref&gt;p.216, Samuels&lt;/ref&gt; The density of troops also affects the planning of [[close air support]] operations because of the higher rate of missions required to deliver adequate munitions to their targets.&lt;ref&gt;p.123, Brown&lt;/ref&gt; The increased dispersal of troops was the consideration behind the decision to develop [[nuclear bomb]]s before effects of radiation were realised.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Bellamy&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical density of troops in the area of combat is not reflective of the average value for any given [[Command (military formation)|command]] because dispersion of troops tends to follow [[terrain]] and [[military tactics|tactical]] considerations of the combat planning, and actual location of troops tends to be in clusters of [[position (military)|positions]].&lt;ref&gt;p.191, Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; Low troop density is a particular problem as a period of vulnerability during [[air assault]], [[air landing]], [[amphibious assault]] and to some extent [[airborne assault]] operations,&lt;ref&gt;p.32, McCall &amp; Corder&lt;/ref&gt; as well as during pre-combat concentration of troops in the [[staging area]] prior to their movement to the battle area, denying them [[operational mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;p.64, National Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertebrate zoology''' is the [[biology|biological]] [[discipline]] that consists of the study of [[Vertebrate]] animals, i.e., animals with a [[vertebral column|backbone]], such as [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s.

==Subdivisions==
This subdivision of [[zoology]] has many further subdivisions, including:
*[[Ichthyology]] - the study of [[fishes]].
*[[Mammalogy]] - the study of [[mammals]].
*[[Ornithology]] - the study of [[birds]].
*[[Herpetology]] - the study of [[reptiles]].
*[[Batrachology]] - the study of [[amphibians]].

These divisions are sometimes further divided into more specific specialties.
