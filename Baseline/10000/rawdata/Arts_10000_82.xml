{{nihongo|'''Akabeko'''|赤べこ|Akabeko|''red cow''}} is a legendary [[cattle|cow]] from the [[Aizu]] region of [[Japan]], who inspired a traditional [[toy]]. Aizu legend claims that the toys are based on a real cow used to build the Enzō-ji temple of [[Yanaizu, Fukushima|Yanaizu]] in the ninth century.

The toy is made from two pieces of [[papier-mâché]]-covered wood, shaped and painted to look like a red cow or ox. One piece represents the cow's head and neck and the other its body. The head and neck hangs from a string and fits into the hollow body. When the toy is moved, the head thus bobs up and down and side to side. The earliest akabeko toys were created in the late 16th or early 17th century.

Over time, people came to believe that the toys could ward off [[smallpox]] and other illnesses. Akabeko has become one of [[Fukushima Prefecture]]'s most famous crafts and a symbol of the Aizu region. It has also been recognized as a symbol of the larger [[Tōhoku region]], of which Fukushima Prefecture is a part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-282521648.html TV commercials transmitting the attractions of Japan and Tohoku to the world], States News Service, 8 March 2012 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the legend==
[[File:Akabeko1.png|thumb|Artist rendition of the legendary Akabeko cow]]
According to an Aizu-area legend recorded by Thomas Madden, akabeko toys are based upon a real cow that lived in CE 807. At that time, a monk named Tokuichi was supervising the construction of Enzō-ji&lt;!-- 圓蔵寺 --&gt;, a temple in [[Yanaizu, Fukushima]]. Upon the temple's completion, the akabeko gave its spirit to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and its flesh immediately turned to stone.

Another version of the tale claims that the cow instead refused to leave the temple grounds after construction had been completed and became a permanent fixture there. The red cow was called {{nihongo|akabeko|赤べこ|akabeko|''beko'' is [[Tōhoku dialect|Aizu dialect]] for ''cow''}} and became a symbol of zealous devotion to the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

After [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] had solidified his power over Japan, his representative, [[Gamō Ujisato]], was sent to be the lord of the Aizu region in 1590. At his new post, Ujisato heard the story of akabeko and ordered his court artisans, who had accompanied him from [[Kyoto]], to create a toy based on the red cow. These early [[papier-mâché]] akabeko introduced most of the basic elements for which the toy is known.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

In the same period, Japan suffered a smallpox outbreak. People in Aizu noticed that children who owned akabeko toys did not seem to catch the illness.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt; The akabeko's red colour may have enhanced this association, since red amulets are thought to protect against that illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |title=Mingei: Japanese Folk Toys |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Schwartz |first=Nicole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204307/http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |archivedate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Dorothy (1991). ''Encyclopedia of Japan: Japanese History and Culture, from Abacus to Zori''. Facts on File. {{ISBN|0-8160-1934-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Akabeko toys became very popular as charms to ward off sickness, a Superstition that persists in modern times.

==Production==

Akabeko are made from [[papier-mâché]] that is painted and [[lacquer]]ed. The toy consists of two main pieces: the body, and the head and neck. The body is hollow and open on one end. The neck and head fit into this opening, suspended from a piece of string. Whenever the akabeko is moved or jostled, its head bobs up and down and side to side.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

Akabeko are made by fewer than a dozen family-run workshops, whose members have passed down the technique for generations. The process takes about 10 days to complete. The artisan begins by wrapping wetted ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper) around two blocks of wood, one shaped like the cow's body, and the other shaped like the head and neck. These blocks have often been used for several generations. Once the paper dries, the artisan splits it in two lengthwise and removes the wooden blocks. The craftsperson then rejoins the pieces of molded paper by wrapping more layers of ''washi'' around them.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

The artisan paints the toy, beginning with black, then adding the characteristic red, and finally the white eyes and other details. The akabeko's markings vary from workshop to workshop. For example, the Igarashi family paints the [[kanji|Chinese character]] ''kotobuki'' (寿 ''longevity'' and ''luck'') on the cow's back and a sun and moon on its side; other workshops add gold markings. The artisan finishes the toy with a thin coat of lacquer.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

'''Army Ants''' are a discontinued fantasy [[toy soldier]] line from [[Hasbro]] in much the same venue as the [[M.U.S.C.L.E.]] and [[Monster in My Pocket]] lines. It featured an army of humanoid ants.

Released in 1987, Army Ants were originally released in "squadrons" (sets) of three or eight figures, set on card-backed blister packs. The individual soldiers had various themes, including officers, international soldiers (such as French Foreign Legion soldiers and English guards), and aviators (in the form of flying ants).

==Army Ants Roster==
Army Ants were organized into two opposing armies: an Orange Army led by "General Patant" and a Blue Army led by "General Mc-Anther." There were 5 sets for each army: 4 of three figures and 1 of eight figures, which also contained the general for the army.

===Orange Army===

** '''General Patant'''
** '''Stalker'''

==Alternate versions==
Army Ants were also sold in Europe under several names. The most documented online is the [[Italy|Italian]] version called '''Kombattini''' (the French version was called '''Termitors'''). Kombattini were marketed by [[GIG (company)|GIG]], a toy manufacturer that also produced similar toy soldier lines such as [[Exogini]] (the Italian version of M.U.S.C.L.E.), and gained great popularity between the 1980s and 1990s, partially due to a particularly successful [[advertising campaign]]. Kombattini used the same 40 molds as Army Ants but with several design differences:
* figurines were painted a single, solid color with no detailing;
* Red Army soldiers were painted iridescent blue, green, or white;
* Blue Army soldiers were painted iridescent black, pink, or gray;
* both armies also had rare transparent ants;
* each model of ant was available in all four colors for its army;
* the ants' rubber abdomens (called "ampolla della forza", "ampules of force") were transparent and glittery.

The toys were also sold differently. Instead of cardboard blister packs, they were available in packages of one, buckets of 4, or pyramids of 8 or 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kombattini.altervista.org/index1.html Kombattini index (in Italian)]. Retrieved on April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As for the English version, each figure had a distinct name, but GIG chose to adopt humorous names mangling those of famous people of the time, including politicians, sportsmen and people from the show business (e.g., "Tromba il bomba" for skier [[Alberto Tomba]], "Van Basta il Tosto" for soccer player [[Marco van Basten]], or "Benigno il Commando" for comedian [[Roberto Benigni]]).

{{Culture of Myanmar}}

== Introduction ==
[[Myanmar]] (Burma) is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] which has endured isolation from 1962 - 2011. It is also a country with deep rooted [[Buddhist]] beliefs. The [[contemporary art]] scene in the country reflects these facts, and the art is often related to Buddhism and the difficult socio-political situation. In this age of [[globalization]], '''Burmese contemporary art''' has developed rather on its own terms.

== History ==
One of the first to study western art was [[Ba Nyan]]. Together with [[Ngwe Gaing]] and a handful of other artists, they were pioneers of western painting style in Burma. Later, most of the students learnt from masters through apprenticeship.  Some well known contemporary artists are mentioned below.

[[Lun Gywe]] (born 1930)&lt;ref&gt;''U Lun Gywe — A Master Painter from Myanmar''. Thavibu Gallery, 2005. {{ISBN|974-92905-6-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the undisputed old master of Burmese painting.  He has been the mentor of many younger generations of artists. Lun Gywe is a master with colours, often in an [[impressionistic]] manner, and is particularly fond of painting the beauty of women.  His works are represented in the [[National Museum of Myanmar]] and the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]].

== Art spaces ==

== Artists ==
[[Aung Kyaw Htet]] (born 1965) is a devout [[Buddhist]] who grew up in a small village—two factors which have a strong influence on his art. His paintings of religious life in Burma show [[monks]] and [[nuns]] in a realistic manner, though non-essential objects are omitted from the paintings to focus on the religious aspects.  Aung Kyaw Htet paints the faces of monks and nuns in great detail to show their humanity.  His works are represented in the [[National Museum of Myanmar]] and the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]].

Four additional artists who were found worthy to have their works included in the permanent collection of the [[National Art Gallery of Malaysia]] (the country's contemporary art museum) are [[MPP Yei Myint]], [[Myint Swe (painter)|Myint Swe]], [[Min Wai Aung]] and [[Aung Myint]].

The younger generation of upcoming international contemporary artists include [[Nyein Chan Su]] and [[The Maw Naing]] and the  Gangaw Village Artist Group.

Now there are many contemporary artists such as [[Po Po]]. Po Po (born 1957) lives and works in [[Yangon]]. He studied art himself (he describes himself as self-taught) and works with various media especially with installation works. He has staged solo exhibitions since 1987; they include “Untitled” and “Solid Concept” among others. He participated in the Kwangju Biennale 2000, the Flying Circus Project 2004 and Yokohama Triennale 2005.

[[Wah Nu]] was born in Yangon in 1977, and launched herself on an artistic career after graduating from the [[University of Culture, Yangon]] in 1998 where she majored in music. Since then she has developed a personal expression by mainly adopting painting and video as media. In 2004, she held the exhibition “Cloud Department” in Yangon. That is her first solo exhibition and then 2005, “Self-Identity” second in gallery Art-U room,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-u-room.com/wahnu/wahnu.html Wah Nu], [http://www.art-u-room.com/ Art-U room].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. She showed in group exhibitions including ''Bangladesh Biennale 2004'', ''Fukuoka Triennale 2005''&lt;ref&gt;[http://faam.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/FT/eng/2005/ 3rd Fukuoka Triennale 2005], [[Fukuoka]], [[Japan]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Another Seven Artists'' in Yangon 2008. Recently, she participate in ''The 6th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art'' in Brisbane with her husband, artist, Tun Win Aung, who works in multimedia installations and performance arts.

Most of the young artists who were born in the 1980s have greater chances of art practises inside and outside the country. [[Performance art]] is a popular genre among Burmese young artists. Aung Ko, Moe Satt, Mrat Lunn Htwann and Nyan Lin Htet are some of the promising artists. Among them, Nyan Lin Htet started making performance art works in early 2000s and later he joined the contemporary theatre group Annees Folles for intensive theatre training with Japanese theatre director Arata Kitamura in Japan. Since 2005, Lin Htet has been actively involved in international performance art and theatre scenes. After founding the Yangon-based experimental theatre group [http://www.theatreofthedisturbed.org Theatre of the Disturbed] in 2005, Lin Htet directed theatrical adaptations of dramatic and literary works by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Franz Kafka]] as well as dramatic works by local playwrights including himself. In 2007, he was awarded the 2-year Artist-in-residency programme at Cité Internationale des Arts-Paris with the support of Alliance Française de Rangoun and Ministry of Foreign Affairs-France. Lin Htet has been recognized not only as the most promising Burmese contemporary theatre artist but as one of the few promoters of contemporary Burmese art and theatre. He is currently based in [[Europe]].

The '''butterfly dance''' is a dance move in which the dancer's legs move like butterfly wings. The move originated from the music genre [[hip-hop]] and is also commonly seen in [[reggae]] type music.&lt;ref&gt;Safi Thomas, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlpnDa2J9kM How to Dance to Reggae Dancehall: How to Do the Butterfly in Reggae Dancehall] at YouTube.com. Hip-hop Dance Conservatory, New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is a female move but male individuals have been seen to execute the move.

This dance move originated in the 1970s.

'''''Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas'''''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nrmEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:0684808323&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi659ClhcHLAhXGORoKHXyKDWsQ6AEIHTAA Google Books: Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ISBN|0684808323}}) is a 1995 non-fiction book by crime [[journalist|reporter]] [[Nicholas Pileggi]] that depicts the story of the alliance of [[American Mafia|Mafia]] mobsters [[Lefty Rosenthal]] and [[Tony Spilotro]] and their exploits working in Mafia controlled casinos in [[Las Vegas]]. 

==Summary==
''Casino'' covers the period through the seventies to early eighties when the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] controlled certain [[Las Vegas]] casinos. Pileggi focuses on the story of [[Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal]], a [[Chicago]] bookmaker working for organized crime, and his friend, partner and also Mafia member, [[Anthony Spilotro]]. Rosenthal supervises the casino operations, while Spilotro provides protection, security and also masterminds jewelry raids that lead to his crew being nicknamed the [[Hole in the Wall Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/28/books/books-of-the-times-the-mob-s-tale-of-sorrow-about-las-vegas.html New York Times: Casino by Nicholas Pileggi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film version==
The book is the basis for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/ IMDB: Casino]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[1995 in film|1995]]) directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. The screenplay for ''Casino'' was by Pileggi and Scorsese. Although Pileggi had already written the book and wanted it published in advance of the film version, Scorsese persuaded him to forgo the usual chronology and to release the book after the film.&lt;ref name="Baxter p337"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baxter, John |title=De Niro: A Biography|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main protagonists/antagonists of Rosenthal and Spilotro were portrayed as [[Ace Rothstein]] and [[Nicky Santoro]] by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Joe Pesci]]. [[Sharon Stone]], playing Rothstein's wife, Ginger, was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (lost to [[Susan Sarandon]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/awards IMDB: Casino: Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers''''' is an oil-on-canvas painting by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] undertaken between 1769 and 1770.&lt;ref name="artf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9525/colonel-acland-and-lord-sydney-the|title=Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=70921&amp;searchid=10016&amp;tabview=work|title=Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers  1769|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork depicts the two [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s [[John Dyke Acland|Colonel John Dyke Acland]] (1746–1778; at right) and [[Dudley Cosby, 1st Baron Sydney|Lord Sydney]] (1732–1774), a diplomat. Reynolds began the work in 1769, and completed it the next year. In 1769 Reynolds had become the first president of the new [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="artf" /&gt; In September 2005, the [[Tate Gallery]] purchased the painting for more than £2.5 million, equivalent to [[United States|US]]$4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Archers saved for the Nation - A first for Tate's new Collection Fund'' (Press release of 6 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

The work portrays the two men holding each a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], while the [[shotgun]] was the more popular choice of weapon at the time.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}
These two bow-wielding men can be seen in the clearing of a forest. They are both garbed in [[archery|archer]] clothing; their hunted prey lies close to their feet. Their facial expressions, coupled with Cosby's eagerness and poise, suggest that they are both preparing to loose an [[arrow]] at an approaching animal.
Distantly in the background, a river, a clump of trees, and a meadow can be seen. Further back, at the skyline mountain peaks can be seen below thick grey clouds.

The portrait shares the same textural schemes and design of several other works by Reynolds. The allusion to the classical era is apparent in both the clothing worn by the two aristocrats, and their choice of weapon.&lt;ref name="artf" /&gt;

== Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}}However, the use of the bow for recreational use was, at the time, coming back into revival, and so this may not have been too uncommon when Reynolds created the work.

'''''Cromwell on his Farm''''' (1874) is a painting by [[Ford Madox Brown]] which depicts [[Oliver Cromwell]] observing a [[bonfire]] on his farm and thinking of a passage in the [[Book of Psalms]]: "Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself - forever? And shall thy wrath burn like fire?" (Psalm 89). The words are inscribed on the painting's frame along with a quotation from one of Cromwell's speeches, in which he describes his life before entering into politics: "living neither in any considerable height, nor yet in obscurity, I did endeavour to discharge the duty of an honest man."&lt;ref&gt;National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, ''Artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Circle: the First Generation'', 1988, pp. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The painting depicts Cromwell as a country squire on his lands in [[Cambridgeshire]], before he became a national figure in the power struggles which culminated in the [[English Civil War]]. Cromwell's identity as a leading revolutionary had been affirmed by [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s biography [http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf  ''Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations''] (1845), in which his reluctance to take up the role of leader was emphasised. Carlyle was an important influence on Brown.

==Composition==

The painting's central theme is that of enforced inertia. In it, Cromwell is portrayed as someone who has the capacity to become a major player on the national stage, but who is restricted to his own small world. It emphasises inertia through the portrayal of the distraction of Cromwell's horse by wayside fodder, which is also being eaten by a lamb from the farm: a reference to the concept of the Christian [[Local church|flock]]. The wandering piglets following a sow under Cromwell's horse refer to the story of the [[Legion (demon)|Gadarene swine]]. Cromwell carries an oak sapling in lieu of a whip, and a copy of the [[Bible]].

The farm is a metaphor for the state, a place in which orderly labour is threatened continually by forces of disorder and in which the most everyday details are potentially filled with moral and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] significance.&lt;ref&gt;Trodd, C, ''Culture and Energy, Ford Madox Brown and the Cromwellian grotesque'', Victorian Culture and the Idea of the Grotesque, 1998, pp. 68-73.&lt;/ref&gt; While the workers on the left of the composition are getting on with their labours, clearing away weeds, the servant at the right is demanding a response from Cromwell, her shout repeated by the screeching duck she carries. The pigs under the horse and the lamb all create a potential for disruption and instability. Behind the workers clearing weeds, a young farm worker barely controls the large herd of cattle streaming though the gate into Crowmell's farm, separating the latter from his wife and child, visible at the door of the house at the right. A spot of blood can be seen on Cromwell's collar, a reference to a famous description of him by [[Philip Warwick|Sir Philip Warwick]], and emblematic of a bloodstained future.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick wrote "He wore... a plain cloth-suit, which seemed to have been made by a poor tailor; his shirt was plain, and not very clean; and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his collar; [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUcromwellO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korea-Silla kingdom-Gold crown from Hwangnam Daechong-No.191-01D.jpg|thumb|right|A gold crown from Hwangnamdaechong National Treasure No. 191.]]
The '''[[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] of Silla''' were made in the [[Korea]]n kingdom of [[Silla]] approximately in the 5th&amp;ndash;7th centuries.

These crowns were excavated in [[Gyeongju]], the former capital of Silla, and are designated [[National treasures of South Korea]].

The Silla crowns are very fragile and weigh more than one kilogram.  The Silla kings probably did not wear the golden crowns regularly.  They were probably used only for formal and ceremonial occasions.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Korea-Silla Kingdom-Golden hat-01.jpg|thumb|left|A golden inner cap of a Silla crown from the sixth century.]]
[[File:Korea-National.Folk.Museum-01.jpg|thumb|right|The crown jewels of Silla.]]
The Silla crowns were uncovered in the [[tumuli]] of [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]], the capital of [[Silla]] and [[Unified Silla]].  Silla tumuli, unlike their [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] counterparts were made inaccessible because the tombs did not include passageways and corridors.  Instead, deep pits were dug and lined with wood and this is where the treasures and coffin were placed.  These burial pits were covered in dirt and sealed with clay and then the surface was covered with massive river boulders which were then covered with massive mounds of dirt.  The heavy boulders also served to push the tombs deeper into the ground {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, thus making them even more inaccessible.  The Silla burial mechanism made it so that grave robbers and foreign invaders could never steal their precious contents.  Some of the crowns are made of pure gold and were probably reserved for kings.  Other crowns have been discovered made from gilt-bronze or gold-plated bronze, probably for princes or lesser kings.  Silla crowns have been excavated from the 5th century [[Gold Crown Tomb]], and the 6th century [[Gold Bell Tomb]] and [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]].&lt;ref name="Golden treasures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm|title=Golden Treasures: The Royal Tombs of Silla – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|first=Author: Soyoung|last=Lee|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adoption of Buddhism by the Silla kings in 528 A.D. led to the eventual decline of the practice of burying gold artifacts in tombs and by the end of the sixth century the practice had stopped.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;

== Symbolism of the crown ==
[[File:TilliaTepeCrown2.jpg|thumb|This crown was excavated from Grave Six in [[Tillia Tepe]], Afghanistan and is estimated to be from the first or second century.  The style of the crown strongly suggests a Scytho-Iranian connection with Korea.]]
The styling of the outer part of the crowns suggests a Korean connection with the Scytho-[[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] ([[Saka]]) and the people of the [[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian]] [[steppe]].  The crowns are a uniquely Korean product and show no Chinese influence. The Silla crown is also notably distinct from the [[crown of Baekje]], the [[crown of Gaya]], and the crown of Goguryeo kingdoms.  The tree motif of the crown is commonly believed to represent the idea of the [[world tree]] which was an important tenet of Siberian and Iranian shamanism.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kidder"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kidder |first=J. Edward |title=Early Japanese Art: The Great Tombs and Treasures | publisher=D Van Nostrand Company Inc | page=105 |date=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some believe that the trident-like protrusions symbolize mountains or even birds.  Additionally, the antler-like prongs also indicate a strong connection to [[Korean Shamanism]] or the importance of the reindeer.  A crown in [[Afghanistan]] (see image) bears a strong resemblance to the other Korean crowns which is also evidence of a Scytho-Iranian connection.  Additionally, the sophisticated [[metalworking]] of the crowns show that Silla gold smiths held an advanced knowledge of working with gold.  Some have even theorized that these advanced [[goldworking]] techniques, such as [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]] and [[filigree]], came from the Greek or the [[Etruscan people]], especially because Silla tumuli also contain beads and glassware which came from as far away as the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/05/eak/ht05eak.htm|title=Korea, 1–500 A.D. - Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But researches and historical documents suggest a [[Persian people|Persian]] connection or even origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/1500-years-contact-between-korea-and-middle-east|title=1,500 Years of Contact between Korea and the Middle East|work=Middle East Institute|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SillaCrownGuimet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A crown of [[Silla]] made in 5-6th century exhibited at [[Musée Guimet]] in [[Paris]].]]

The delicate nature of the gold crowns comes from the fact they were made from cutting thin sheet gold. The crown is impractical to wear and some believe that the crown may have been made specifically as a burial good.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;  The use of [[gogok]], or comma-shaped curved jewels also point to an Iranian influence and the importance of the bear cult.{{what|date=July 2017}}  There may also be a connection with [[ancient Japan]] because the gogok were used extensively by the ruling elite of that society as well.  These comma-shaped jewels of jade and glass may have symbolized the fruits and the bounty of trees.  The use of many tiny gold mirrors dangling from the crown has led some to hypothesize that the crown, worn in sunlight, would be a dazzling spectacle reinforcing the tradition role of the Silla king as the symbolic representation of the sun on earth.

The crowns come in two major parts.  The inner part is a golden cap, which may have been covered in silk.  This cap would sit within the band of the outer crown.  There is a third part of the crown, namely the chains of gold with attached jade that may have been attached to the outer band.  However, there is significant controversy over how the crown was supposed to be worn.  Some believe that the three total parts were supposed to be worn together in one crown.  However, the fact that the three parts of the crown have been found in three distinct areas of certain tombs, such as the [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]] suggests that the three objects are, in fact, three different types of crowns for different occasions.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;87'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold Crown from Geumgwanchong''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=금관총 금관|hanja={{linktext|金|冠|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Geumgwanchong geumgwan|mr=Kŭmgwanch'ong kŭmgwan}}) is the largest golden crown discovered. The [[Gold Crown Tomb]] (''Geumgwanchong'') was named after this treasure.  It was designated as a national treasure on December 12, 1962.

The crown is 44&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height and has a diameter of 19&amp;nbsp;centimeters.  It is the largest golden crown from Silla discovered thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennfamily.org/KSS-USA/460910-15.htm|title=Display Detail Information|website=www.pennfamily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two parts to this crown.  The outer band was discovered within the tomb while the inner cap was found outside of the tomb.  The outer band consists of three tree-like branches which have three branches each.  The [[Chinese character]] {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} ''chul'' is written three times on the hand band {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.  Additionally, the outer head band also has two antler-like protrusions on the left and right side.  All of the protrusions have jade and glass beads and tiny golden mirrors that dangle from the branches.  On the sides of the headband also are two chains of gold with leaf-like decorations that end with jade jewels.  These two chains hang below the head band.

The inner crown is a triangle-shaped hat made of thin sheet gold and has two wing-like decorations on it.  The wings are believed to relate to Korean shamanistic beliefs.

The crown is currently housed in the [[Gyeongju National Museum]] and is a masterpiece of Korean art.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;188'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold Crown from Cheonmachong''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=천마총 금관|hanja={{linktext|天|馬|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Cheonmachong geumgwan|mr=Ch'ŏnmach'ong kŭmgwan}}) is currently housed in Gyeongju National Museum.  The crown was designated as the 188th National Treasure of Korea on December 7, 1978.  The crown was found in Cheonmachong (Tomb No.&amp;nbsp;155, also known as The [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]]) in 1973 and is believed to be the crown of King [[Soji of Silla|Soji]] or King [[Jijeung of Silla|Jijeung]].

The crown is 32.5&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.

There are three prongs forming the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:山|山]]}} “mountain” on the front of the crown.  There are also two prongs in the shape of a deer antler on the back.  This crown also has two dangling chains of gold in the shape of leaves hanging from the end of the headband.  Notably, the tree-like prongs of this crown have four branches instead of the more common used three branch motif.  There is still controversy of how this crown was to be worn because of where it was found in the tomb in relation to the coffin.

&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold crown from Hwangnamdaechong'''({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=황남대총 북분 금관|hanja={{linktext|皇|南|大|塚|北|墳|金|冠}}|rr=Hwangnamdaechong bukbun geumgwan}}) is currently housed in the [[National Museum of Korea]] and is one of the most popular exhibits there, along with the two [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (disambiguation)|Bangasayusang]]&lt;!--good link to DAB page--&gt;.  It is a National Treasure of Korea and was named as one on December 12, 1978.  The height of the crown is 27.5&amp;nbsp;centimeters and the gold chains and pendants that dangle from the crown, known as ''Suhasik'' are 13 to 30.3 centimeters in length.  The crown is known for its abundant use of jade.  The ''Suhasik'' are grouped into two groups of three and are arranged with the longest chains on the outer edge to the smallest chains closest to the front of the crown.  The ''Suhasik'' also hold blue jade and golden leaves on the end of the chains.  There is still a controversy of whether the ''Suhasik'' are actually a part of the crown, namely because the ''Suhasik'' were found separate from the crown when excavated.  The crown has three tree-like prongs with three branches each and also has two antler-like prongs on the left and right side of the main band.  The tree-like prongs of the crown have been interpreted by some scholars as the Chinese character for “mountain”.  Decorations of a deer antler are attached to the ends of the crown.  77&amp;nbsp;pieces of [[jade]] were adorned on the crown.  Sixteen pieces of comma-shaped blue jade were attached to the Chinese characters, nine pieces of jade on the deer antler, and eleven pieces on the head girdle.  This crown is particularly noted for its abundant use of jade.

This crown may have been made for a queen and there is a significant controversy about who was buried in the tomb.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;338'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This crown, known as '''Gold crown from Geumnyeongchong Tumulus''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=금령총 금관|hanja={{linktext|金|鈴|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Geumnyeongchong geumgwan|mr=Kŭmnyŏngch'ong kŭmgwan}}), is currently housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].  At 27&amp;nbsp;centimeters in heights and 15&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, it is the smallest Silla crown discovered thus far, and the simplest.  Like a typical Silla crown, it has five main prongs.  The tree-like prongs, shaped like the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} ''chul'', which means “going out”, are placed on the front and sides of the headband.  The tree-like prongs have four branches each.  There are two antler-like prongs which flank the two side tree-like prongs.  Additionally, there are birds on top of each branch.  On the upper and lower part of the surface are two-lined spot patterns made with a stamping technique.  Hanging ornaments hang at the right and left side of the crown frame.

This crown has the distinction of being the only gold crown made solely of gold without any jade accoutrements.

&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold crown from Seobongchong Tumulus''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=서봉총 금관|hanja={{linktext|瑞|鳳|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Seobongchong geumgwan|mr=Sŏbongch'ong kŭmgwan}}) is a gold crown of Silla origin that is now housed at the [[Gyeongju National Museum]].

The crown is 30.7&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height, 18.4&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, and 24.7 high when the ornaments hanging from the headband.  There are five branches standing on the broad crown frame which is stamped with a wave pattern and stamped in a form of a dotted line.  The headband is decorated with leaf-shapes and bent jade.

The right and left most branches, along with the middle branches of the five branches, are composed of the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} in three prongs.  The tips of the branches are decorated with a budding flower ornament.

Two crossing gold belts having the tip on the each 4 dividing points of the crown frame, construct the inside framework.
At the both sides of the crown frame, styled-earrings are dangling from the headband.

|[[File:Silver Crown from the South Mound of Hwangnamdaechong Tomb.jpg|center|250px]]
| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;631'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Silver crown''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=은관〈98호 남분〉|hanja={{linktext|銀|冠}}〈98號南墳〉
|rr=eun(-)gwan (98[=&amp;nbsp;gusippal]ho nambun)|mr=ŭn'kwan (98[=&amp;nbsp;kusippar]ho nambun)}}) from the south mound of Tumulus No.&amp;nbsp;98, is a silver crown and was found near the head of the body in the coffin of the tomb.  The crown is currently housed in [[Gyeongju National Museum]].  The measurements of the crown are: 17.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height, 16.6&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, the width of the headband is 3.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters.  The crown has three prongs but they are unique to any other kind of Silla crown discovered thus far.  The center prong is thick and shaped like a shield or a perhaps a shape bent like a bow with a high middle section.  There is a silver plate attached to this prong.  On either side of the center prong is a crescent-shaped prong.  The outer side of these crescent-shaped prongs are cut and twisted to make feather-like protrusions which are unique to Silla art.  However, there is an analogous example of this feather-like embellishment from a crown of Gaya providence found at the Uiseongtamni Tumulus.  The Eungwan crown was uncovered in Tumuli Park of Michu Royal Tomb in Gyeongju.  The mound is connected from the north and south and so has the shape of a gourd.  With a diameter of 80&amp;nbsp;meters from east to west and 120&amp;nbsp;meters from north to south, it is the largest mound of Silla.  The south mound is 23&amp;nbsp;meters in height, the north mound, which is where National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;191 was uncovered, is 22&amp;nbsp;meters in height.

[[Image:Derrynaflan chalice.jpg|240px|thumb|Derrynaflan Chalice]]
[[Image:Derrynaflan paten.jpg|thumb|Derrynaflan Paten]]

The '''Derrynaflan Chalice''' is an 8th- or 9th-century [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]], that was found as part of the ''Derrynaflan Hoard'' of five liturgical vessels.  The discovery was made on 17 February 1980 near [[Killenaule]], [[County Tipperary]] in Ireland. According to art historian Michael Ryan the hoard "represents the most complex and sumptuous expression of the ecclesiastical art-style of early-medieval Ireland as we know it in its eighth- and ninth-century maturity."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan 1997:997.&lt;/ref&gt; The area known as Derrynaflan is an island of pastureland surrounded by bogland, which was the site of an early Irish [[abbey]].  The [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] was found with a composite silver [[paten]], a hoop that may have been a stand for the paten, a liturgical [[strainer]] and a bronze basin inverted over the other objects.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan, "The Derrynaflan Hoard and Early Irish Art" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:995–1017) p. 997, with wide-ranging notes.&lt;/ref&gt; The group is among the most important surviving examples of [[insular art|Insular]] metalwork.  It was donated to the Irish State and the items are now on display in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="NMIweb"&gt;{{cite web

The hoard was probably secreted during the turbulent 10th to 12th centuries, when Viking raids and dynastic turmoil created many occasions when valuables were hidden. The early and later 10th century is marked by a particular concentration of hoarding in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan 1997:998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 032.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
Derrynaflan is a small island of dry land situated in a surrounding area of peat bogs, in the [[townland]] of Lurgoe, Co. Tipperary, northeast of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]]. The monastery was an important foundation in the period preceding the Viking raids; the present modest ruins of a small [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] nave-and-chancel [[abbey]] church there, however, date from a later period.

The [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/derrynaflan-hoard/ Derrynaflan Hoard] was discovered on 17 February 1980 by Michael Webb from [[Clonmel]] and his son, also Michael, while they were exploring the ancient monastic site of Derrynaflan with a metal detector.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/derrynaflan-hoard/&lt;/ref&gt; They had the implied permission of the owners of the land on which the ruins stood to visit the site but they had no permission to dig on the lands. A preservation order had been made in respect of the ruin under the National Monuments Act, 1930, so that it was an offence to injure or to interfere with the site.&lt;ref&gt; Webb v Ireland [1988] IR 353 &lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was initially kept secret for three weeks.&lt;ref name=IrInd29July06&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Ardagh Chalice]] was discovered in [[County Limerick]], at Reerasta Rath in Uí Fidgenti, 1868.]]
The behaviour of the Webbs, and nearly seven years of litigation, culminating in the Supreme Court action where they unsuccessfully sought over £5,000,000 for the find, led to the replacement of Irish laws of [[treasure trove]] by the law in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, with a new Section 2 being included in the legislation.

The [[Ardagh Chalice]] dates from around the same period, perhaps a century earlier, of the Derrynaflan Hoard and was found close by in neighbouring [[County Limerick]]. At the time, the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of [[Munster]] were the [[Eóganachta]], while their longtime allies and possible cousins the [[Uí Fidgenti]] ruled in the Limerick area. [[Feidlimid mac Cremthanin]], king-bishop of Cashel, who became [[King of Munster]] in 821 and died in 847, was a patron of the monastic foundation at Derrynaflan and has been suggested as a possible patron of the chalice.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, with reservations, 1997:997: "This sort of particularism is dangerous as hypotheses of this nature tend to be elevated into 'facts'".&lt;/ref&gt;

As a masterpiece of Insular art, the Derrynaflan chalice was included in the exhibition "The Work of Angels: Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th Centuries AD" (London, 1989, included in the catalogue).

Lady '''Edith Blake''' (7 February 1846 – 18 April 1926) was an Irish [[botany|botanical]] illustrator and writer, noted for her work on the flora and fauna of countries such as The Bahamas, Jamaica and Ceylon.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Frances|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=Blake, Lady Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edith Blake was born Edith Bernal Osborne on 7 February 1846 in [[Newtown Anner House]], near [[Clonmel]], County Tipperary. Though her date of birth is often cited at 1845. She was the eldest daughter of [[Catherine Isabella Osborne]] and [[Ralph Bernal Osborne]], who took his wife's surname following their marriage in 1844. The Osbornes appear to have become estranged early in their marriage, with her father living in London, seeing Edith and her Grace raised by her mother alone. Mrs Osbourne was a talented artist, and encouraged both her daughters to take up artistic pursuits.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; Artists often stayed at Newtown Anner, including [[Thomas Shotter Boys]] and [[Alexandre Calame]], and it is possible the sisters received tuition from them.&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Edith Blake (1845–1928)|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/art-nature-imaging/collections/art-themes/drawingconclusions/more/lifecycle_more_info.htm|website=Natural History Museum London|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith developed an interest in botany around this time, corresponding over the years with Newtown Anner's garden designer [[Joseph Paxton]]. [[Fanny Currey]] was a frequent visitor to the house, with the pair collaborating on illustrating envelopes from 1858 to 1868.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

In 1874 she married widower and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] sub-inspector [[Henry Arthur Blake]]. As her parents did not approve of the marriage and had been arranging a suitable marriage for her, the couple eloped.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt; Following the marriage, Edith was disinherited. They were sheltered for a time by friends [[Richard Bagwell|Richard]] and [[Harriet Bagwell]] of Marlfield House. The couple went on to have two sons and a daughter. They first moved to [[Belfast]], seeing Henry appointed [[resident magistrate]] (RM) in 1876 and a "special RM" during the land war. When he received assassination threats, Edith would travel with him armed with a gun. Despite her husband's work, Blake was sympathetic to romantic nationalism and became friends with [[Anna Catherine Parnell|Anna Parnell]].&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

==Illustration and writing==
Blake toured Europe in 1872, visiting Austria, (Germany), Italy, Sicily, Greece, and Turkey. During these visits she took sketches of the local architecture, art, and culture which she published in her first book ''Twelve months in southern Europe'' (1876). Blake's second publication was ''The realities of Freemasonry'' in 1879. Blake's husband received his first appointment in the British colonial service in 1884, as governor of The Bahamas 1884 to 1887, followed by [[Newfoundland]] 1887 to 1888, Jamaica 1889 to 1897, Hong Kong 1898 to 1903, and Ceylon 1903 to 1907. Blake travelled with him, and rather than entertaining the local English expatriate community, she focused on her time on botany and painting. She studied local flora and fauna in watercolour, which she painted from nature. These were exhibited at the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Museum of Science and Art, Dublin]] in 1894. 196 of her studies of the life stages of Jamaican [[lepidoptera]] are in the entomology library of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London, and more of her work is held by the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)|National Botanic Gardens, Dublin]]. It is said that whilst in the Bahamas she was painted with a pet snake wrapped around her waist.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Blake produced landscapes, and painted the opening of the 1888 Newfoundland Placentia Railway. She contributed to a number of English and American scientific journals, and was heavily involved in the development of the countries the couple lived in. The National Museum of the Native American in New York holds her collection of over a 100 Native American artefacts from the Bahamas. She was an accomplished linguist, speaking 9 languages including Irish, Russian, and Chinese.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; The couple's three children were painted by [[Winslow Homer]] in Arabian dress.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=The girl in the painting|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-girl-in-the-painting-2303618.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=The Independent|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Blake opened a Buddhist nunnery which was named in her honour in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=9780415332330|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Queen|first1=Christopher S.|last2=King|first2=Sallie B.|title=Engaged Buddhism: Buddhist Liberation Movements in Asia|date=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=9780791428436|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Upon Henry's retirement in 1907, the Blakes returned to Ireland. They settled in [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal]], County Cork, where many of Blakes sketchbooks are still held. The staircase was decorated by her with botanical illustrations. As Lady Blake she published 3 plays: ''Samhain's eve'', ''The quest of Edain'', and ''The swan'', all adapted from Irish mythology.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; Following her husband's death in 1918, Blake lived as a near recluse wearing widows weeds, but continued to paint.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt; She died in Myrtle Grove on 18 April 1926.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; The couple are buried in the garden of the house.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;

Her collection in Natural History Museum, London was conserved in 1984 and are noted for their scientific value.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt;

'''''Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile''''' is an 1890–1891 painting by [[John Singer Sargent]]. It is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/50.130.16/ |title=Egyptians Raising Water from the Nile &amp;#124; John Singer Sargent &amp;#124; 50.130.16 &amp;#124; Work of Art &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sargent made several trips to Egypt, Greece and Turkey as part of a project commissioned by the Boston Public Library to explore the origin of Western religion through art. Whilst in Egypt he created this canvas in 1890–91, depicting a group of locals drinking or collecting water from the Nile which had been raised to the bank by a [[shaduf]].

'''''Execution''''' is a 1995 painting by [[Chinese art|Chinese]] artist [[Yue Minjun]].  The piece was inspired by the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], although the artist stated through translation that the art should not be viewed as depicting what happened at [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/11/china.artist/index.html#cnnSTCText CNN Edition Oct 11 2007 world news.]  'Execution' artist rejects Tiananmen label.

Chinese painting sets sales record at London auction. Retrieved Oct 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Yue Minjun painted ''Execution'' in 1995 in a month.  He sold the painting to [[Hong Kong]] art dealer Manfred Schoeni for $5,000.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; Trevor Simon, investment banker, stumbled across the painting in 1996 in the back of a Hong Kong gallery.  He convinced Schoeni to sell the piece for [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]250,000 / [[United States dollar|US$]]32,200.  The painting was then shipped from Hong Kong to London, where Simon stored it in a warehouse.  Under the terms, the painting was to remain out of sight for five years in a warehouse.&lt;ref name="cnn2" /&gt;

In 2007, ''Execution'' became the most expensive work of Chinese contemporary art, selling for [[Pound sterling|£]]2.9 million / [[United States dollar|US$]]5.9 million / [[Euro|€]]4.2 million at London's [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;  The art piece was billed by Sotheby's as "Among the most historically important paintings of the Chinese avant-garde ever to appear at auction."&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;  Simon called Yue a brave man for painting something so seemingly politically dangerous.&lt;ref name="cnn2" /&gt;

The artist, Yue, denies that his paintings are a veiled criticism of his [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] or of Chinese society, and he does not believe his work will bring him trouble.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; 

{{quote|I want the audience not to think of one thing or one place or one event.  The whole world's the background.  As I said, the viewer should not link this painting to Tiananmen.  But Tiananmen is the catalyst for conceiving of this painting.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;}}

The painting has been compared to Goya's ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' and Manet's ''[[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]''.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;

The '''flag of [[Asturias]]''' shows the "Cruz de la Victoria" ([[Victory Cross]]) in yellow ([[Pantone Matching System|PMS]] 109) over blue (PMS 829).

==History==
The origin of the flag of Asturias is in 1808, during the [[Peninsular War]]. As there was not any [[Flag of Spain|Spanish national flag]] yet, Asturians created the current flag, without any separatist intention in the war against the [[French First Empire|Napoleon's empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/asturias/2016/09/07/tres-independencias-asturias/00031473241728887787807.htm|title=Los tres momentos históricos en los que Asturias pudo ser independiente|publisher=La Voz de Asturias|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first version, it included the motto ''Asturias jamás vencida'' (Asturias never defeated).

According to the tradition, the [[Victory Cross]] was carried by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], first [[Kingdom of Asturias|King of Asturias]], in the decisive [[Battle of Covadonga]] against the Moors in 722. This battle, fought in the mountains of Asturias, was hailed by 19th and 20th century historiography as the start of the [[Reconquista]], the Christian re-conquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moorish domination. However, there is not any historical evidence about the use of this cross.

In 908 the Asturian King [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III the Great]] ordered that the original wooden cross, made of oak, be clad in gold and precious stones. Currently, it is kept in the [[Cámara Santa|Holy Chamber]] of the [[Oviedo Cathedral]].

The Greek letters [[Alpha and Omega]] hang from its horizontal axis. This is a direct reference to the [[Book of Revelation]] (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13)., ''I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.''

'''Giclée''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|iː|ˈ|k|l|eɪ}} {{respell|zhee|KLAY}}) is a [[neologism]] [[Coined term|coined]] in&amp;nbsp;1991 by [[Printmaking|printmaker]] Jack Duganne for [[fine art]] [[Digital printing|digital prints]] made on [[inkjet printer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; The name originally applied to fine art prints created on a modified [[Iris printer]] in a process invented in the late 1980s. It has since been used loosely to mean any fine-art, most of the times archival, inkjet print. It is often used by artists, galleries, and print shops to suggest high quality printing but since it is an unregulated word it has no associated warranty of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wjKzHzemCxAC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=giclee+inkjet+printer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VcjtT46XGOiT0QH3vZWHDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=giclee%20inkjet%20printer&amp;f=false Robert Hirsch, Greg Erf, Exploring Color Photography: From Film to Pixels, page 201]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The word ''giclée'' was adopted by Jack Duganne around 1990. He was a printmaker working at [[Graham Nash#Nash Editions|Nash Editions]]. He wanted a name for the new type of prints they were producing on a modified [[Iris printer]], a [[Large format (photography)|large-format]], [[Image resolution|high-resolution]] industrial [[prepress proofing]] inkjet printer on which the paper receiving the ink is attached to a rotating drum and that they had adapted for fine-art printing. He was specifically looking for a word that would differentiate them from regular commercial IRIS prints then used as proofs in the commercial printing industry. "Giclée" is based on the [[French language|French]] word ''gicleur'', the French technical term for a jet or a nozzle, and the verb coming from it "gicler" (to squirt out). "Une giclée" (noun) means a spurt of some liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harald"&gt;Johnson, Harald, Mastering Digital Printing, Second Edition, Thomson Course Technology - 2005, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[verb]] form ''gicler'' means to spray, spout, or squirt. It describes the movement of a liquid that is suddenly under violent pressure and has only got a tiny hole to exit the compressed space in which it is. Duganne settled on the [[noun]] ''giclée''. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Daniel. [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-25/entertainment/9901250193_1_giclee-ink-jet-prints-jet-printer "Ink-jet art runs gamut from low brow to high class"], Baltimore Sun&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

Besides its original association with Iris prints, the word ''giclée'' has come to be somewhat loosely associated with other types of [[inkjet printing]] including processes that use dyes or fade-resistant, archival inks ([[pigment]]-based), and archival substrates primarily produced on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Epson]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and other large-format printers.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; These printers use the [[CMYK]]&amp;nbsp; (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) color process as a base but may have other added color [[Ink cartridge|cartridges]] for better color or black and white rendition (such as light [[magenta]] and light [[cyan]], light and very light gray, even orange and green (Epson) inks in addition to regular cyan, magenta yellow and black inks); these improve the apparent color [[gamut]] and allow smoother gradient transitions and more accurate colors.&lt;ref&gt;Vandsburger, Judith. [http://www.signindustry.com/digital/articles/2003-01-31-NUR-8colorDigitalPrinting.php3 "8-Color Printing: What’s Hype and What’s Real?"], signindustry.com&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] on which an image can be printed with such inks are available, including various textures and finishes such as matte [[Photographic paper|photo paper]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] paper, cotton [[canvas]], pre-coated canvas, or artist textured vinyl.

== Applications ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

Artists generally use inkjet printing to make reproductions of their original two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated art]]. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than&amp;nbsp;$50, not including scanning and [[color correction]], compared to $5 for a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having to be set up and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not have to pay for the expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used. As a result numerous individual artists own and operate their own printers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6936">'''Guerrilla Girls On Tour''' is an anonymous [[touring theatre]] company whose mission is to develop activist plays, [[performance art]] and street theatre addressing [[feminism]] and women's history.  Formed when the original Guerrilla Girls split into three separate groups in 2001, Guerrilla Girls On Tour has performed in 17 countries and 39 US states with "Feminists Are Funny," "If You Can Stand the Heat: The History of Women and Food," "Silence is Violence" and "The History of Women in Theatre, Condensed".

== History ==

Guerrilla Girls On Tour is one of the three groups that formed when the original Guerrilla Girls split in 2001.  The other two groups are Guerrilla Girls, Inc., and Guerrilla Girls Broad Band.  Since their formation Guerrilla Girls On Tour had developed a unique feminist performance technique that incorporates skits, sketch, improvisation, dance, parody and vaudeville to address [[sexism]], pay equity, body image, the beauty industry and the "F" word, among other issues.  Their feminist theatre technique relies heavily on audience participation and interactivity and might involve their audiences in writing assignments, sing-a-longs and on stage participation.

Like the original Guerrilla Girls, founded in 1985, each member of Guerrilla Girls On Tour performs using the name of a dead female [[artist]] and wears a gorilla mask to conceal her true identity. Their company is made up of approximately 20 to 30 members of women actors, directors, designers, producers, directors and theatre administrators. Guerrilla Girls On Tour have been featured in the Village Voice, BackStage, Mother Jones, The New York Times, CUNY TV's Women In Theatre Series, i-D Magazine, American Theatre, Antiborder Conference Warsaw, LA Times, In Theatre, the BBC, French Channel 2, amNewYork, Wysokie Obcasy, and The Tony Awards.

== Tours ==

Guerrilla Girls On Tour currently tours 4 performances: ''Feminists Are Funny,  Silence Is Violence, The History of Women in Theatre: Condensed and [[If You Can Stand The Heat: The History Of Women And Food]].''

''Feminists Are Funny'' is an energetic romp through humorous historical moments in [[feminist history]] as well as the history of Guerrilla Girls On Tour.  The show provides an overview of GGOT's posters, street theatre actions, and excerpts from the current comedies in  repertoire.  Feminists Are Funny addresses the lack of parity for women in global theatre, political issues facing women such as [[reproductive rights]], the war in Iraq, current number of women elected to government, [[sex trafficking]] and [[violence against women]]....all in a fast paced comedy.  '''Guerrilla Girls On Tour''' briefly research each place they visit and include current local issues and [[statistics]] on the state of the arts for women in every city they perform in.

''Silence Is Violence'' contains similar material to ''Feminists Are Funny'' but includes a 30-minute section on up-to-date statistics and strategies for combating [[violence against women]].  Guerrilla Girls On Tour dramatize a series of [[date rape]] situations and educate the audience with information on how to set boundaries and avoid potentially dangerous situations.  The entire show is both upbeat and empowering.  Local and statewide stats regarding violence against women are incorporated into each performance making them site-specific.

''The History of Women In Theatre: Condensed'' is the recovered herstory of women in [[Portal:Theatre|world theatre]] in 90 minutes revealing the work of some of the most prolific yet unknown women of the [[History of theatre|modern theatre]].

''If You Can Stand the Heat: The History of Women and Food'' explores women's relationship to [[food]].  In Part I: "PIE" – celebrated food writer [[M.F.K. Fisher]] takes us on a 10-minute musical romp though the history of women and food while baking her favorite apple pie. In Part II "CAKE" – southern cooking expert [[Edna Lewis]] polls the audience in an exercise that unleashes female obsession/anxiety over body image.  And in Part III "BREAD" culinary heroine [[Julia Child]] explores global food supply and [[nutrition]] as well as women as both homemakers and bread winners while baking a French baguette.

Exhibitions of Guerrilla Girls On Tour's posters have been organized at [[museums]] in the US, and at Zendai MoMA, China; Portobello Film Festival, UK and the [[Busan Biennale]] in South Korea.  The Guerrilla Girls On Tour's web site contains all of their visual works as well as their annual Girlcott List (a list of theatres across the US that do not include plays by women in their mainstage seasons) and the annual Good News List (where to find plays by women). Their portfolio has been collected by museums and art collectors such as the [[Linda Lee Alter]] Collection of Art by Women,  
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Gallery of Canada.

== Website ==

'''''A History of the Book in America''''' is a five-volume series of scholarly books of essays published 2000–2010 by the [[University of North Carolina Press]], and edited by David D. Hall. Topics include [[printing]], [[publishing]], [[bookselling|book selling]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and other aspects of [[print culture]] in [[colonial America]] and the United States. Among the contributing writers: Hugh Amory, Georgia B. Barnhill, [[Paul S. Boyer]], Richard D. Brown, Scott E. Casper, Charles E. Clark, [[James P. Danky]], [[Ann Fabian]], James N. Green, [[Robert A. Gross]], Jeffrey D. Groves, [[David D. Hall]], Mary Kelley, [[E. Jennifer Monaghan]], [[Janice Radway]], [[James Raven]], Elizabeth Carroll Reilly, Joan Shelley Rubin, [[Michael Schudson]], David S. Shields, [[Wayne A. Wiegand]], Michael Winship.

The five volumes in ''A History of the Book in America'' offer a sweeping chronicle of our country's print production and culture from colonial times to the end of the twentieth century. This interdisciplinary, collaborative work of scholarship examines the book trades as they have developed and spread throughout the United States; provides a history of U.S. literary cultures; investigates the practice of reading and, more broadly, the uses of literacy; and links literary culture with larger themes in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469621647/a-history-of-the-book-in-america-5-volume-set/|title=A History of the Book in America (5 volume set) {{!}} David D.

'''Louis-François, Baron Lejeune''' (3 February 1775 in [[Strasbourg]] – 29 February 1848) was a [[France|French]] [[general]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[lithographer]]. His memoirs have frequently been republished and his name is engraved on the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

==Life==
He studied painting in the studio of [[Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes]], alongside [[Jean-Victor Bertin]], but left the studio to volunteer in the [[Compagnie des arts de Paris]] in 1792. He received his baptism of fire in the [[battle of Valmy]] later that year. He became a sergeant in the 1st Arsenal battalion and in 1793 moved to the artillery at [[La Fère]], assisting in the sieges of [[Landrecies]], [[Le Quesnoy]] and [[Valenciennes]]. At Valenciennes he became [[aide-de-camp]] to general Jacob then, as a lieutenant on attachment to the engineers, took part in the 1794 Holland campaign and the 1795 campaign.

Called to the depot in 1798, he succeeded brilliantly in his exams and was made a captain on attachment to the engineers. He became aide-de-camp to Marshal [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] in 1800, a post he retained until 1812 and in which he took an active part in practically all of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic campaigns]]. He was wounded and captured in [[Peninsular War|Spain]]. He was promoted to full captain after [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] and chef de bataillon after [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], also becoming a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and a colonel at the [[Second Siege of Zaragoza|Siege of Saragossa]].

The German campaign of 1806 brought him to [[Munich]], where he visited the workshop of [[Alois Senefelder]], the inventor of [[lithography]]. Lejeune was fascinated by the possibilities of the new method and whilst there he made the drawing on stone of his famous [[Cossack]] (printed by C. and ~f. Senefelder, 1806). Whilst he was taking his dinner, and with his horses harnessed and waiting to take him back to Paris, one hundred proofs were printed, one of which he subsequently submitted to Napoleon. The introduction of lithography into France was greatly due to the efforts of Lejeune.

In 1812, during the French invasion of Russia, he was made [[général de brigade]] and chief of staff to [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]]. Frostbitten on the face, Lejeune left his post during the retreat from Russia and was arrested on the orders of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. Freed in March 1813, Lejeune was then sent to the Illyrian provinces, before rejoining the army under the orders of marshal [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot|Oudinot]], becoming his chief of staff. During the Saxony campaign, Lejeune was present at the [[Battle of Lutzen (1813)]], the crossing of the [[River Spree]] and at [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]]. He was made an officer of the Légion d'honneur and a commander of the [[Order of Maximilian of Bavaria]]. At the battle of Hoyersverda, when [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bülow von Dennewitz|Bülow]]'s corps wiped out the 12th corps formed up in square on the plain, Lejeune (at risk of being kidnapped) ventured into the enemy lines with one battalion, general Wolf's cavalry and six 12 pounder guns. He thus broke the whole of the Prussian artillery and saved marshal Oudinot and his army. Wounded several times and lastly at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]], he was authorised to leave the army in November 1813 after more than 20 years' service. After his departure from the army, he devoted himself to painting.

After an initial grant in [[Hanover]] in 1808, and a second in [[Westphalia]] in 1810, he was made a [[Nobility of the First French Empire|baron d'Empire]] in 1810. Already a member of the cross of the [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold]], Lejeune was made a [[knight of St Louis]] by [[Louis XVIII]] and in 1823 a commander of the Légion d'honneur. He returned to the army (now under the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]) from 1818 to 1824, becoming commander of [[Haute-Garonne]] in 1831. On 2 September 1821 he married Louise Clary, sister of general Marius Clary and niece of [[Désirée Clary]], queen of Sweden by her marriage with [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]. In 1824 the king of Sweden conferred on Lejeune the grand-cross of the [[Order of the Sword]]. In 1837 he became director of the École des beaux-arts et de l’industrie in [[Toulouse]], a city of which he became mayor in 1841 and in which he died of a heart attack aged 73.

He produced an important series of battle-pictures based on his experiences. He had kept his paintbrushes with him on the battlefield and the popularity he enjoyed was due to the truth and vigour of his work, which was generally executed from sketches and studies made on the battlefield. His works are known for their lofty perspective' "offering a panoramic view of the totality of the battle's events." &lt;ref&gt;The Art of War[s] - Chase Maenius&lt;/ref&gt; When his battle-pictures were shown at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]], a rail had to be put up to protect them from the eager crowds of sightseers. He is best known for his paintings of the [[battle of Guirando]], which appeared in 1819 to enormous success, and of the [[battle of Borodino]], his masterwork. Many of his battle-pictures were engraved by [[Jacques Joseph Coiny]] and [[Edme Bovinet]]. He also produced several studies of uniforms in the French Imperial Army, such as those of the lancers of [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Berg]] under [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] and of Berthier's aides-de-camp.

Among his chief works are ''The Entry of Charles X. into Paris, 6 June 1825'' at Versailles; ''Episode of the Prussian War, October 1807'' at [[Douai Museum]]; ''Marengo (1801)''; ''Lodi, Thabor, Aboukir'' (1804); ''The Pyramids'' (1806); ''Passage of the Rhine in 1795'' (1824), and ''Moskawa'' (??).

'''Mustafa Râkim''' ({{lang-ota| '''مصطفى رآقم'''}}; [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]]: ''Mustafa Râkım'') (1757–1826), was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligraphy|calligrapher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesartsturcs.org/calligraphy/ottoman.html|title=The Ottoman Period|publisher=Les Arts Turcs|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended and reformed [[Hâfiz Osman]]'s style, placing greater emphasis on technical perfection, which broadened the calligraphic art to encompass the [[Thuluth|Sülüs]] script as well as the [[Naskh (script)|Nesih]] script.&lt;ref name=kalemguzeli&gt;[http://www.kalemguzeli.org/index.php?go=icerikgoster2&amp;MKNO=46&amp;KNO=34 Mustafa Rakım Efendi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Mustafa Râkim was born in Unye on the Black Sea in 1758. When he was very young, his father, Mehmed Kaptan, took him to Istanbul to live with his brother, [[İsmail Zühdi Efendi]], who was an established calligrapher.&lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; After Ismail was appointed as an instructor of calligraphy at the Imperial Palace , the young Râkim received his formal training there studying under his brother. Mustafa Râkim would become Ismail Zühidi's most celebtrated pupil.&lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ismail Zühidi and Mustafa Râkim went on to develop their own style of calligraphy based on the work of [[Hâfiz Osman]]. They were able to develop a style of ''celî sülüs'' that was aesthetically pleasing, something that other calligraphers had not been able to do.&lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Râkim also reformed the calligraphic shape of the tughra script.&lt;ref&gt;Ga'bor, A and Masters, B.A., ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', Infobase Publishing, 2010, p. 117; Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998 , p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the revolutionary changes brought about in calligraphy by Mustafa Râkim,&lt;ref name=aksiyon&gt;[http://www.aksiyon.biz/detay.php?id=2902 Haşim Söylemez, Türk Picassosu Rakım Efendi, Aksiyon Dergisi, Sayı 455, 25.08.2003]&lt;/ref&gt; scholars treat Turkish calligraphic art history  into two key eras: "Pre-Râkim" and "Post-Râkim". He was able to accomplish what nobody before him could in the [[Jali (script)|Jali]]-[[Thuluth]] script and [[tughra]]s of sultans. By finding the ideal measurement between the letter thickness and pen (writing tool) thickness, he established the style and form for the ideal beauty of tughras.&lt;ref&gt;Uğur Derman, M., ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  

He is regarded as the first great [[Turkish people|Turkish]] painter in the Western sense of painting. His bird, parrot, painting is considered to be the first [[Realism (arts)|realist]] work of Turkish painting.&lt;ref name=ordu&gt;[http://www.ordukulturturizm.gov.tr/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76 Ordu İl Kültür ve Turizm Müdürlüğü web sitesi, Erişim tarihi:03.06.2011]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew a portrait of Sultan [[Selim III]] who was amazed by his work and recited a poem in his honor in return.

'''''New Essays on Human Understanding''''' ({{lang-fr|Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain}}) is a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] of [[John Locke]]'s major work, ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. It is one of only two full-length works by Leibniz (the other being the [[Théodicée|''Theodicy'']]). It was finished in 1704 but Locke's death  was the cause alleged by Leibniz to withhold its publication. The book appeared some sixty years later.&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres philosophiques'', latines et françoises&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;, de feu Mr. de Leibnitz, tirées de ses manuscrits, qui se conservent dans la bibliothèque royale à Hanovre, et publiees par Rud. Eric Raspe, Amsterdam et Leipzig, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many philosophical works of the time, it is written in [[dialogue]] form.

==Overview==
The two speakers in the book are Theophilus ("loving God" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qeo%2Ffil-os&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qeo%2Ffil-os0 "θεόφιλος"]. ''[[LSJ]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who represents the views of Leibniz, and Philalethes ("loving truth" in Greek),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=filalh%2Fqhs&amp;la=greek "φιλαλήθης"]. ''[[LSJ]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; who represents those of Locke. The famous rebuttal to the empiricist thesis about the provenance of ideas  appears at the beginning of ''Book II'': "Nothing is in the mind without being first in the senses, except for the mind itself".&lt;ref&gt;Book II, Ch. 1, §2: "''Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu excipe: nisi ipse intellectus''".&lt;/ref&gt; All of Locke's major arguments against innate ideas are criticized at length by Leibniz, who defends an extreme view of innate cognition, according to which all thoughts and actions of the soul are innate.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Leibniz, ''New Essays on Human Understanding''. Translated and edited by Peter Remnant and Jonathan Bennett. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his discussion of innate ideas, Leibniz offers penetrating critiques of Locke's views on personal identity, free will, mind-body dualism, language, necessary truth, and Locke's attempted proof of the existence of God.

'''''Northeaster''''' is one of several paintings on marine subjects by the late-19th-century American painter [[Winslow Homer]]. Like ''[[The Fog Warning]]'' and ''[[Breezing Up]]'', he created it during his time in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Winslow_Homer.aspx |title=Winslow Homer |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|The Gale Group Inc.]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on display in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

==Background and description==
After extensive travel, Homer settled in [[Prouts Neck]], Maine. He had a studio built for him, which was completed in 1884, and painted marine subjects, including the hard lives of the fishermen and their families. He increasingly chose to depict the sea itself, and was especially attracted to stormy seas. During this period he painted a wide array of seascapes such as ''The Gulf Stream'' (1899), ''Moonlight&amp;nbsp;– Wood's Island Light'' (1886), ''Northeaster'' (1895) and ''Early Morning After a Storm at Sea'' (1902). Many of his paintings depict the battlefront of the sea and the shore, and the waves crashing onto the rocky shore.

==Provenance==
''Northeaster'' was at [[Knoedler|M. Knoedler and Company]] of New York in 1895 and then in 1895–96 with [[Thomas B. Clarke]], also in New York. It was then returned to Homer in Maine. In 1900 it was again with Knoedler. From 1901 to 1910 it was owned by George A. Hearn, also of New York, who gave it to the Metropolitan Museum.&lt;ref name=Met/&gt;

[[File:Palace of Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiev.jpg|thumb|right|Palace of Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]]
Zeynalabdin Taghiyev's palace – [[Baku]], H.Z. Taghiyev Street 4 (former Gorkogovskaya Street 6), previously owned by Baku millionaire [[Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]], and now the palace building houses the [[National Museum of History of Azerbaijan]]. The building was constructed in 1893–1902 by civil engineer [[Józef Gosławski (architect)|Józef Gosławski]]. The [[palace]] was Taghiyev's gift for his wife Sona khanim. The building covers a whole quarter in the central part of the city and has an ancient planning structure. The main symmetrical facade has been built in the forms of [[Italian Renaissance]]. 
During the construction of the palace, Goslawski used classic order, but some elements of the composition and interiors of the halls were inspired by [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] architectural traditions. Various architectural styles were used during the construction of the palace.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baku architects between XIX-XX centuries|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev.jpg|thumb|left|Zeynalabdin Taghiyev in early years of 20th century]]
[[File:Tagiyev's house.jpg|thumb|left|Taghiyev's palace in 1950]]
H.Z. Taghiyev was the customer of Goslawski's architectural works. Examples of these works are Taghiyev's palace, the Muslim girls' school, Taghiyev's villa in Mardakan, Taghiyev's Caucasian-made textile factory building. Goslawski also took part in designing a dwelling house built on the corner of [[Zarifa Aliyeva]] Street (former Mercuryev Street), where H.Z.Taghiyev's theater was built. Thus, according to the scale of [[Baku]], a small complex consisting of the architect's works appeared in one of the central areas.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"/&gt;

Construction works were started in 1895 on the streets of Gorkovskaya and Mercuryevskaya. It was assumed from the words inscribed on the building facade. According to some sources, after the completion of the first part of the building, this part was given to Volzhko-Kamsky (Volzhsko-Kamsky) bank. The construction materials used for the building, as well as equipment, furniture, chandeliers and interior were brought from Russia and Western Europe and foreign craftsmen and artists were invited. It was reported that 270 people were employed as engineers, architects, carpenters and other masters at the construction of Taghiyev's palace.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"/&gt;

All equipment inside the palace was imported from Russia, France, America, Germany. In the house heat and cooling systems were installed. 40 thousand rubles of gold were worked out by the masters on the ceiling patterns. The pillars of the palace decorated with diamond and colored mirror bottles, and the floor was covered with natural birch planks from Russia. Furniture from America, pictures and curtains were brought from Germany. Only 1.2&amp;nbsp;million rubles were spent on construction of the building (without imports of furniture and equipment from abroad).&lt;ref name="HM"&gt;[http://www.azhistorymuseum.az/index.php?mod=5&amp;item=85&amp;id=25 History of the palace], www.azhistorymuseum.az&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1914, the Baku Treasury Bank headed by H.Z.Taghiyev was also in the palace. In April 1920, the Bolsheviks, who had taken power in [[Azerbaijan]], confiscated the Taghiyev palace, and a part of the State History Museum had begun to operate. In 1941–1954, the Museum of History was transferred to the Shirvanshahs palace. In 1954, the second floor of the building was returned to the History Museum. On the first floor, the Technical and Medical Documents Archive was placed. All Tagiyev's property was handed over to the Azerbaijani History Museum in just 2000. Taghiyev palace has been reconstructed several times.&lt;ref name="HM"/&gt;

The '''Parc Abbey Bible''' ([[London]], [[British Library]], Add. MS 14788, 14789, and 14790) is a 12th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Bible]].  It was made in the [[Leuven]] region of [[Belgium]] at the [[Abbey of St. Mary of Parc]].  A [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] on  folio 197 indicates that the [[codex]] was produced in 1148.  The text is [[Latin]] and written in proto-[[blackletter|gothic book script]] on [[vellum]].  The folios are 437 by 300 mm, with the text block being 340 by 240 mm.  The [[manuscript]] is illuminated with miniatures, diagrams, decorated borders, and decorated initials.  The decorated initials include historiated, inhabited, and foliate initials.

The Bible was purchased by the British Library in 1844.  It is now kept in three volumes. The first volume (Add. MS 14788) contains the [[Pentateuch]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], I [[Ezra]],  2 Ezra, and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]. The second volume (Add. MS 14789) contains [[Books of Kings|Kings]], [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] and [[Maccabees]]  The third volume (Add. MS 14790) contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], the [[minor prophets]], and the [[New Testament]].

'''Post-contemporary''' (PoCo) is a forward-looking aesthetic philosophy distinguished by a re-constructive, global, human ethos which posits that the aesthetic experience is universal to humanity, and that this experience can inspire understanding and transformation. It has developed in tandem with new theories of [[Emergence]] in Complexity science, as well as advances in [[Biosemiotics]]. In art historical terms, “modern” and “contemporary” arts are limited to their era and are defined by stylistic and philosophical parameters - chief among them, a critique of the classical European tradition and constructive philosophy, and secondly, the Contemporary ethos is characterized by an emphasis on transient or exclusively contemporary issues which reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. Following the legacy of [[Modernism]], [[Post-Modernism]] and [[Contemporary art]] follow the tradition of [[Deconstruction]] and questioning, while Post Contemporary emphasizes generating new, constructive hypotheses. However, modeled after the Scientific Method, both modes are inter-dependent as the question|answer cannot exist without each other. Thus, Post-Contemporary views the history of the humanities as branching and pluralist, rather than a linear path of development. Consequently, PoCo has chosen a forking path, builds upon knowledge from all eras, and values quality, sublimnity, and empathy above novelty. PoCo emphasizes empathy for all, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.

Post-Contemporary as a concept was first described by Italian Poet Primo Levi. (See Philosophical Overview.) Though as of yet, the first documented use of the specific term was in 2005 by [[Abbas Gharib]] in a conversation with [[Bahram Shirdel]], two architects of Iranian origins, both proficient in  western culture and participant in the current debate on. The conversation was published by Sharestan Magazine, 55 . 2007.&lt;ref name=Sharestan&gt;[[Abbas Gharib]] and [[Bahram Shirdel]] "A discussion between two architects", Sharestan Magazine 15-–6, Teheran, Iran: Sharestan/Naghshiran, Spring&amp;nbsp;– Summer 2007, 11–16, (7–12 in Persian).&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion took this definition also to distinguish the [[third millennium]] epitomes of creative sectors, by their projection into coming [[avant-garde]] configurations, toward future. To day in its own progress, the Post-contemporary concepts, often known simply as Po-co is much better defined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbas Gharib|A. Gharib]], "the third spatiality in the [[third Millennium]]",  Architecture &amp; Urbanism Magazine 52–53, Teheran, Iran: Faroos/Epthoform, 2000, 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main topics==

Far from the modernist [[heterotopia (space)|heterotopia]], the post modernist [[historicism]] [[contemporary]] hazards and the current tautologies.&lt;ref name=Sharestan /&gt; The objective of two architects now is the recognition of the renovated of creative disciplines which are [[morphing|forming]] their concepts, by shifting above the [[contemporary]] contents and projections,

==Characteristics and attributes==

By the ending decade of twentieth century, the “transitional contemporary” as the plethora of western thoughts was mainly expressed in intellectual patterns, by borrowing tools from functions such as fluidity, flexibility, dynamicity, continuity, heterogeneity, smoothness, and transparency or by acquisition of concepts from transitional Philosophy  such as multiplicity, difference, repetition, nomadic and “weak thought".&lt;ref&gt;Vattimo Gianni, Dialectic, Difference Weak Thought, ©2012 State University of New York Albany&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of twenty-first century, the opening  of minds and matters to the social contexts of sciences, technologies and to the means of physical environments, as well as to the organizational contents of political and economical components, helped the post-contemporary propositions to shift from the contemporary assumptions toward a new universal theory for retooling the educational, cultural and creative systems. 
In the same decade, the universal crisis of the western economical system, and the deficits of the industrial productions mostly basing on the same system  led to need of redefinition of social, political and economical resources, as the organizational components of territories.
These are the needs of re-appraisals on the industrial societies, for the implantation of post-contemporary organizational contents by the paradigms given by sciences and technologies toward the means of physical environments from micro-systems. to the macro- organizations and vice versa.

==Post–Euclidean mathematics and geometries ==
[[File:Nonlinear Dynamics.jpg|right|thumb| '''Methods of Qualitative Theory in Nonlinear Dynamics'''&lt;br /&gt;

The origin in diversely phenomenological systems and exact models from life sciences is in the area of the theory of applied dynamical systems and global bifurcations. The special interest in the subject can be find in a new emergent cross-disciplinary field known as mathematical neuroscience. Its scopes include nonlinear models of individual neurons and networks. In-depth analysis of such systems requires development of advanced mathematical tools paired with sophisticated computations. For instance, Andrey Shilnikov, a neuroscientist and mathematician derives models and create bifurcation toolkits for studying a stunning array of complex activities such as multistability of individual neurons and polyrhythmic bursting patterns discovered in multifunctional central pattern generators governing vital locomotor behaviors of animals and humans. Thanks to the non linear qualitative dynamics, the organization of holistic nature of post-contemporary lineage was implemented by interoprativity and interactivity within the heterogeneous components and characters of Micro - systems, being present in many concrete social contents and in most territorial recourses.  In this way [[post-structuralism]] as well as the new sciences of complexity, [[Complex system|Complexity theory]] and [[chaos theory]], were appropriated and interpreted within Micro - systems by means of "self-creation", expressing a fundamental [[dialectic]] among [[structure]], [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] and [[function (engineering)|function]], identifiable and recognizable in concrete territorial contexts.

==Relevances to architecture and design==
In the field of architecture, the flourishing endeavor of "Architecture of complexities"&lt;ref&gt;The Architecture of Complexity, Herbert A. Simon, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 106, no. 6. 1962, pp. 467–482. [http://ecoplexity.org/files/uploads/Simon.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or customized "Folding" Theory for architecture in the transitional contemporary architecture are outstanding examples. The matter is well distinct by Patrick Schumacher from [[Zaha Hadid Architects]] issued as Parametric Pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Parametric Patterns The Autopoiesis of Architecture, Volume I &amp; II, Wiley Editor , NJ- USA, 2012 {{ISBN|0470772999}}.[http://www.patrikschumacher.com/Texts/Parametric%20Patterns.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:POL Culture and Art Centre 2.jpg|right|thumb| A. Gharib, POL Culture and Art Centre:&lt;br /&gt;"Continues, Smooth and Heterogeneous"]]

The use of digital and parametric techniques have created a new saptial organization in Urban Design, Architecture, and Design that values the organizing form over the abstract function. This is a new method, out of the modern abstractions, versus its two-dimensional projections and against its typical linearity and flatness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrikschumacher.com/index.htm P. Schumacher;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, an important critical topic was written on this subject by [[Farshid Moussavi]] a London-based architect and university teacher of Iranian origins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Farshid Moussavi]] on the need for parametric thinking.[http://www.elcontexto.net/post/15032978670/farshid-moussavi-on-the-need-for-parametric-thinking]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[holistic]] dynamicity of Post-contemporary paradigm and its built-in capacities for design agenda, incorporates the ten creative sectors such as [[architecture]], [[urban design]], [[engineering]], [[design]], [[graphics]], [[art]], [[photography]], [[cinematography]], [[music]] and [[performing arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ten-international.net Tenstar Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007181842/http://www.ten-international.net/ |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture must evolve to keep itself relevant for society and to do this must adapt itself to the  Post-contemporary social and technological conditions and innovate by absorbing its influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrikschumacher.com/index.htm Patrik Schumacher, "Lectures &amp; Interviews"&amp;nbsp;– theorizing architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage from the “star system architecture” to the social design is also improved by awarding the social architecture of [[Shigeru Ban]], a Tokyo-born, architect by [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] 2014, who designs elegant, innovative work for private clients, and uses the same inventive and resourceful design approach for his extensive humanitarian design efforts, which is just a beginning.

==In Visual Art==
In the visual arts, Post-Contemporary has taken the form of representational painting, photography, and sculpture which addresses current issues in globalized culture.&lt;ref&gt;"The Post Contemporary Paradigm", Brandon Kralik, Huffington Post, Aug 29th 2014 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brandon-kralik/the-post-contemporary-par_b_5731594.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[New Britain Museum of American Art]] was the first to dedicate a room to Post-Contemporary Art in their permanent collection - highlighting their new collection with a discussion panel on the term.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn of the Post-Contemporary, Daniel Maidman, Huffington Post, Dec, 20, 2015 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-maidman/dawn-of-the-post-contempo_b_8847168.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbmaa.org/event/panel-discussion-post-contemporary-art-artists Post Contemporary Art Discussion Panel, Graydon Parrish, Sept 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of this collection is Graydon Parrish's "The Cycle of Terror and Tragedy"—a painting concerning the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11.

==Sociological replica==
Post-contemporary society is strongly related to the values of [[sustainability]], putting in plain words the description of a civilization that meets the higher human real needs for a vast majority in an advanced [[post-industrial]] universe, Shifting forward from [[Post-Fordism|Fordism]] and Tylorism industrial managements.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Peaucelle, "From Taylorism to post-Taylorism: Simultaneously pursuing several management objectives", Journal of Organizational Change Management, Vol. 13 Iss: 5, pp.452 - 467 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Post-contemporary bestows our social opportunities to flourish in the utmost of their potential creativity, rather than struggling with the precast sachems or the sinkings in artificial consumerism. The objective therefore is to resolve the causes which go against the self flourishing, the self-fulfillment jointly with the collective harmony, by purge them from the routine of contemporary habits and adopt those post-contemporary values such as creativity, holism, complexity, quality, passion, interconnection, responsibility foremost, the jurisprudence of citizenship  ... This is an education versus the universal belief for the continues economic growth, is a training in order to gain the ability to grasp  [[Complex systems]] within long-term problems, is an exercise against the human tendency which buries the uncomfortable truths or the habit to relate only to what can be seen close to us and see only one cause to one effect. All these or even more are preventing our safe passage toward a sustainable world.&lt;ref&gt;Inspiration for the values came from Gladwin, T.N., W.E. Newburry and E.D. Reiskin. 1997. “Why is the Northern elite mind biased against community, the environment and a sustainable future?”.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economical structure==
Large crowds of interests, constitute in associations and foundations, such as [[Tenstar Community]], Omid Foundation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omid-e-mehr.org Omid Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other progressing [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] institutions, as new [[creative class]] are forming their economic contents and values as the third sector economy, out of the general logo-centric illiteracy of previous century economy. Hence, the learning of the alphabet, the language and the paradigms of the 21st century actions become an ineluctable imperative. This fact is mainly applicable to the economical structures proposed by Post-contemporary vision, which its prosperity and richness creates in an added value out from the profit maximization of speculative economy based on old capitalism of industrial productivity. Post-contemporary assets are recourses from dynamic social economy, pro-profit-no-dividend which its plus value is subject to immediate reinvestment in problem solving, in economy of culture, in creative economy and creative education as the New Third sector operations.

==Philosophical overview==
Amongst the great varieties of creative fields, disciplines and sectors, the post-contemporary knowledge is represented more generally by philosophy and aesthetic. It makes the paradigms and languages of the 21st century, where so far is resisting and should resists to the intellectual temptations for its contamination and re-theorization through the both modernist and post-modernistpast idioms. “ ... resistance, first against being forced in certain tempting directions and against the trends in current popular opinion, against the hole domain of imbecilic interrogation, … But I think that … as [[Primo Levi]] said, the creating would be resistance …”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Delueze: R for Resistance, The ABC’s of Deleuze, interview with Claire Parnet [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNt_3Cfk560]&lt;/ref&gt; Beside, the dynamism of post–contemporary progression is conical and shifts from micro - to macro - systems, along the complex paths of its continued improvements and recognitions. In fact, the advancing of this knowledge is totally antithetical to the expansions of the modernist, the post-modernist and the contemporary obsolete cultural heterotopias. It is quite comprehensible then, why the novel post-contemporary action has brandished the weapon, obtained from the powerful tools of complex systems, against the unstoppable and cyclical rebirth of the 'modernist’ rhetoric, which has blind faith in the reality of single and singular "fact", as an ideology against multiplicity, and idiom which terrifies from the universal and generalizable knowledge, thus, the modernist and the  post-modernist thought, has no existence without a pulse of continuous driving of the abstract "theorization" in its many contradictory aspects, as a symptom that requires continuous intervention for the correction of its own paths of survival. Today within these paths, the two antithetical approaches, the temptations of intellectual reconstructions and the appeals of cultural works are still present as a system of total empiricism. The abstract theorization of the first idiom generates perpetual tautology and the second produces the rhetoric of communication and language. In fact, the new post - contemporary paradigm and language is far from the daily vocabulary of cultural routines, making opposition to modernism and post-modernism idioms by identifying it-self through what is constructive in the progressive intellectual trends of today, projecting their new directions into the coming future. In this complex context, Po-co’s innovative paradigm is looking for new varieties of intervention and fresh forms of knowledge. In this sense, every single isolated act from the realm of conventional theory, results inappropriate, inconvenient and unmentionable, while the post-contemporary look for new types of intervention and new kinds of insights”.&lt;ref&gt;Post-contemporary interventions, Publishers series, Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, Robert M. Dainotto Duke University Press Publishers, 2010, Durham, NC 27708-0660. [http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ProductList.php?viewby=series&amp;id=42&amp;pagenum=all&amp;sort=newest]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One step back, a glance at the contemporary culture, which is still modernist and post-modernist, shows how the relative contents are completely characterized by [[heterotopia (space)|heterotopia]], [[logocentrism]], [[historicism]],  [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] and rhetoric. These are as dominant ideologies that for the most part are unnecessary replication of the related intellectual, subjective and abstract productions, thus evoking the need for the transition to the post- contemporary paradigms.

'''Postmodern dance''' is a [[20th century concert dance]] form that came into popularity in the early 1960s. While the term "postmodern" took on a different meaning when used to describe dance, the dance form did take inspiration from the ideologies of the wider [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] movement, which "sought to deflate what it saw as overly pretentious and ultimately self-serving modernist views of art and the artist"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;International Theory and literary practice, edited by Hans Bertens, and Douwe W. Fokkema, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1997. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/northeastern-ebooks/detail.action?docID=622707&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and was, more generally, a departure from [[Modernism|modernist]] ideals. Lacking stylistic homogeny, Postmodern dance was discerned mainly by its anti-modern dance sentiments rather than by its dance style. The dance form was a reaction to the compositional and presentational constraints of the preceding generation of [[modern dance]], hailing the use of everyday movement as valid performance art and advocating for unconventional methods of dance [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]].

Postmodern dance made the claim that all movement was dance expression and any person was a dancer regardless of training. In this, early postmodern dance was more closely aligned with the ideologies of [[modernism]] rather than the [[architectural]], [[literary]] and [[design]] movements of [[postmodernism]]. However, the postmodern dance movement rapidly developed to embrace the more broad idea of postmodernism, which was reflected in the wide variety of dance works emerging from [[Judson Dance Theater]], a pioneering postmodern dance collective located in [[New York City]] during the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jack (January 31, 1982). "How the Judson Dance Theater Changed American Dance". ''Nytimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The peak popularity of Postmodern dance as a performance art was relatively short, lasting from the early 1960s to the mid 1980s, but due to the changing definitions of postmodernism, it technically reaches the mid 1990s and beyond. The form's influence can be seen in various other dance forms, especially [[contemporary dance]], and in postmodern [[Choreography|choreographic]] processes that are utilized by choreographers in a wide range of dance works.   

==Characteristics of Postmodern Dance==
{{Seealso|20th century concert dance#lineage of dance forms|20th century concert dance}}

=== Early Postmodern Dance: ===
The earliest usage of the term "postmodern" in dance was in the early 1960s. During the formative years of the performance art, the only defining characteristic was the participants' rejection of its predecessor, modern dance. The pioneer choreographers utilized unconventional methods, such as chance procedures and improvisation. Chance procedure, also known as dance by chance, is a method of choreography "based on the idea that there are no prescribed movement materials or orders for a series of actions." &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choreography: A Basic Approach Using Improvisation|last=Minton|first=Sandra|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers|year=2007|isbn=9780736064767|location=|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the chance methods, which could be the toss of a coin, determine the movements rather than the choreographer. Dance by chance was not a distinctly postmodern method – it was first used by modern dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, despite their adamant rejection of their predecessors, many early postmodern choreographers embraced the techniques of modern and classical ballet. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Analytical Postmodern Dance: ===
As postmodern dance progressed into the 1970s, a more identifiable, postmodern style emerged. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sally Banes uses the term "analytical postmodern"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Banes, Sally. Terpsichore in Sneakers: Post-Modern Dance, Wesleyan University Press, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/northeastern-ebooks/detail.action?docID=776783&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the form during the 70s. It was more conceptual, abstract, and distanced itself from expressive elements such as music, lighting, costumes, and props. In this way, analytical postmodern dance aligned more with modernist criteria as defined by art critic Clement Greenberg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Analytical postmodern "became objective as it was distanced from personal expression through the use of scores, bodily attitudes that suggested work and other ordinary movements, verbal commentaries, and tasks." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Modernist influence can also be seen in the analytical postmodern choreographers' use of [[minimalism]], a method used in art that relies on "excessive simplicity and objective approach." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=İnan|first=Şükriye|date=January 2024|title=The Effects of Minimalist Movement on Painting, Arts and Music|url=http://www.ijonte.org/FileUpload/ks63207/File/02.yucetoker1.pdf|journal=International Journal on New Trends in Education and Their Implications|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Analytical postmodern dance was also heavily influenced by the political activism taking place in the U.S. during the late 60s and early 70s.  The [[Black Power movement]], the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movement, the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], and the [[LGBT social movements|LGBTQ movement]] all became more explicitly explored in analytical postmodern dance. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many postmodern dancers during this time, despite their Euro-American backgrounds, were heavily influenced by African-American and Asian forms of dance, music and martial arts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Postmodern Dance 1980 and Beyond: ===
The 1980s saw a distancing from the analytical postmodern dance of the previous decade, and a return to expression in meaning &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, which was rejected by the postmodern dance of the '60s and '70s. Though stylistically, postmodern dance of the '80s and beyond lacked a unifying style, specific aspects could be seen throughout the work of various choreographers. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The form took on an "alliance with the avant/pop music world" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and saw increased distribution on international main stages, with performances in venues such as City Center and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, both in New York City. There was also an increased interesting in preserving dance on film, in repertory, etc., which contrasts the improvisational attitudes of early postmodern dance choreographers. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

Another aspect that unifies the postmodern dance of 1980 forward is the interest in "narrative content and the traditions of dance history." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The more recent forms of postmodern dance have distanced themselves from the formalism of the '70s and began a greater exploration into "meaning of all kinds, from virtuosic skill to language and gesture systems to narrative, autobiography, character, and political manifestos." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Postmodern Choreographic Process ==
{{seealso|choreographic technique}}

Postmodern dance utilized many unconventional methods during the choreographic process. One of the main methods used was chance, which is a technique pioneered in dance by Merce Cunningham that relied on the idea that there were "no prescribed movement materials or orders for a series of action." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Choreographers would use random numbers and equations or even roll dice to determine "how to sequence choreographic phrases, how many dancers would perform at any given point, where they would stand on stage, and where they would enter and exit.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/cunningham/|title=Merce Cunningham in Conversation with John Rockwell|last=Kam|first=Vanessa|date=2005|website=Prelectur.stanford.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using the chance technique, it was not uncommon for dancers in a postmodern piece to hear the music they were dancing to for the first time during the premiere performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-04-15-8701280655-story.html|title=Merce Cunningham's Dance Succeeds by Chance|last=Leader|first=Jody|date=April 15, 1987|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern choreographers also often utilized an objectivism similar to literary theorist [[Roland Barthes]]' idea of "[[death of the author]]." &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Copeland|first=Roger|date=1983|title=Postmodern Dance Postmodern Architecture Postmodernism|url=Jstor.org/stable/3245292|journal=Performing Arts Journal|volume=Vol. 7, No. 1|pages=27-43|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narratives were rarely conveyed in postmodern dance, with the choreographer more focused on "creating an objective presence." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Performances were stripped down – dancers wore simple costumes, the music was minimalist or, in some cases, nonexistent, and performances often "[unfolded] in objective or clock-time rather than a theatrically-condensed or musically-abstract time." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this, postmodern choreography reflects the objective present, rather than the thoughts and ideas of the choreographer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">{{other uses|Luminance (disambiguation)}}

'''Relative luminance''' follows the [[Luminance|photometric definition of luminance]], but with the values normalized to 1 or 100 for a reference white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Poynton, Charles | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | isbn = 1-55860-792-7 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA206&amp;dq=relative-luminance+100-units&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=lU18R8aTJ4iUtgOskqGeBw&amp;sig=IEWpWLxN_3uSazaqN-6dBkJ3UXM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the photometric definition, it is related to the luminous flux density in a particular direction, which is radiant flux density weighted by the [[luminosity function]] {{overline|''y''}}(''λ'') of the CIE Standard Observer.

The use of relative values is useful in systems where absolute reproduction is impractical. For example, in prepress for print media, the absolute luminance of light reflecting off the print depends on the illumination and therefore absolute reproduction cannot be assured.

==Relative luminance in colorimetric spaces==
For [[color space]]s such as [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ]], xyY, etc. the letter Y refers to relative luminance. No computation is required to find relative luminance when it is explicit in a color representation in such spaces.

For [[RGB]] color spaces that use the [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709]] primaries (or [[sRGB]], which defines the same primaries), relative luminance can be calculated '''from linear RGB components: first [[SRGB#The_reverse_transformation|convert the gamma-compressed RGB values to linear RGB]]''', and then &lt;ref&gt;Michael Stokes, Matthew Anderson, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, and Ricardo Motta, "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet - sRGB", [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB online] see matrix at end of Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula reflects the [[luminosity function]]: green light contributes the most to the intensity perceived by humans, and blue light the least.

For other sets of primary chromaticities (defined by their x and y chromaticity coordinates), different linear coefficients are needed to get relative luminance. In general, the coefficients are all positive, the green coefficient is largest and blue smallest, and the three form the middle row of the RGB-to-XYZ color transformation matrix.

For nonlinear gamma-compressed R′G′B′ color spaces as typically used for computer images, a linearization of the R′G′B′ components to RGB is needed before the linear combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Maureen C. Stone]] | title = A Field Guide to Digital Color | publisher = A K Peters, Ltd | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k8IsqEF8FgQC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=inauthor:stone+luminance+linear-values-of-RGB&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=GU98R7ahBpHwsgOw67ieBw&amp;sig=zirxmtOXHJG0vvtFIkQJqb5oYlQ | isbn = 1-56881-161-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[L*a*b*]] space, the L* component is the [[lightness (color)|lightness]]; a perceptual scale of the brightness as a nonlinear function of the relative luminance Y.

Note that [[luminance (relative)|relative luminance]] should not be confused with ''[[luma (video)|luma]]'', the weighted sum of the nonlinear gamma-compressed R′G′B′ components. For color spaces that use luma, such as [[Y′UV]] or [[Y′CbCr]] (where Y′ represents luma), computation of relative luminance can still be done. The R′G′B′ components can be transformed into RGB linear components by undoing the [[gamma compression]]; these linear components can then be used to calculate luminance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">A '''''roman à tiroirs''''' (French for "novel with/made of drawers") is a French term for a novel in which the principal or main [[narrative]] (or "[[frame story]]") is interrupted by secondary narratives (involving secondary characters and/or told by other narrators), which may in turn themselves be interrupted by further narratives/narrators.  As such, it is a form of the "[[story within a story]]" [[literary device]] in which the fiction is nested in two or more layers and where the resolution of the main narrative is delayed because of the inserted secondary tales/stories.  In French, the embedded narratives are referred to as ''récits enchâssés'' or ''récits emboités''.

The expression "à tiroirs" as applied to a work of literature dates from 1752, and appears to have been used originally in reference to theater and plays (a "pièce à tiroirs" or "comédie à tiroirs").&lt;ref&gt;''"Romans à tiroirs" d'hier et d'aujourd'hui: Parodie et experimentation romanesque."'' Maria Eduarda Keating. [http://encls.net/files/Keating.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes this time spent out of school as being significant for allowing her time to play and enter a state of child-like games and develop her imagination during these important early years.&lt;ref name="Collet 90-91"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in Australia during her early years was by her own admission a particular contributing factor from her childhood to her decision to make art a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother told her not to go to art school as the best artists she knew didn't attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was however encouraged by staying with [[Charles Blackman]] as well as having artist friends during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre was also a large influence as Rhys James's mother was an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant production of scenery, props and theatre costumes as well as rehearsal of parts all formed part of the environment that surrounded her during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Histories of Five Contemporary Welsh Women Artists|last=Collet|first=Penelope|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7734-2667-2|location=United States of America|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early education took place in [[Eltham, Victoria|Eltham]], Australia from 5 to 9 years of age then Parliament Hill Girls School, London.&lt;ref name="Collet 90-91" /&gt;

==Education and career==
Rhys James studied at [[Loughborough College of Art and Design]] and in 1976 obtained a degree in Fine Art at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="BBC Arts 2010" /&gt;

She later moved to Powys to live and work, taking her young family with her.&lt;ref name="WM 2003"&gt;Stephanie McNicholas [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/content_objectid=13615823_method=full_siteid=50082_headline=-Meet-the-women-leading-Wales-name_page.html ''Meet the women leading Wales''], Western Mail, 12 November 2003. Retrieved 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhys James is known particularly for her melancholy self-portraits.&lt;ref name="Metro 2008"&gt;Susie Wild [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/209814-art-on-reflection ''Art: On Reflection''], Metro, 8 July 2008. Retrieved 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1993 ''[[Studio with Gloves]]'' shows her sitting in her studio. When she is not painting herself she generally paints other women, still lifes, domestic scenes or "riotously spiky and rip-roaring" vases of flowers. Art critic [[Michael Glover (author)|Michael Glover]] says "There's something mad, wild and thuggish about this work, such is its total lack of restraint. It seems to be gulping at colour... She lathers and slathers on the paint with a kind of unrestrained glee. No wonder the eyes of the model are always slightly bulbous with a kind of childish wonderment".&lt;ref name="Glover 2009"&gt;Michael Glover [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/shani-rhys-james-connaught-brown-london-1706796.html ''Shani Rhys James, Connaught Brown, London: Mad dashes and flying colours''], The Independent, 17 June 2009.

Rhys James has been elected to the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art and the [[56 Group Wales]].&lt;ref name="MT profile" /&gt;

In 2011 the artist and entertainer, [[Rolf Harris]], included Rhys James in a BBC TV series on 'great' Welsh artists. She was the only living artist included. Harris painted a self-portrait in the style of Rhys James, using a small hand mirror and looking at his face 'as a landscape'.&lt;ref name="WM Rolf"&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/television-in-wales/2011/02/12/can-you-tell-who-it-s-by-yet-rolf-harris-91466-28149283/ ''Can you tell who it’s by yet? - Rolf Harris''], Western Mail, 12 February 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">The '''Symphony No. 6''' is an [[orchestra]]l [[symphony]] in six movements by the American composer [[Howard Hanson]].  The work was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the direction of [[Leonard Bernstein]] for the orchestra's 125th anniversary.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rhein |first=John von |title=Howard Hanson: Symphony No. 3, Symphony No. 6, "Fantasy Variations on a Theme of Youth" |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=February 3, 1991 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-03/entertainment/9101100657_1_delos-new-york-chamber-symphony-gerard-schwarz |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was composed in 1967 and was given its world premiere on February 29, 1968, by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Hanson.

==Structure==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 20 minutes and is composed in six continuous [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Andante
#Allegro scherzando
#Adagio
#Allegro assai

==Reception==
The Symphony No. 6 has been praised by music critics.  John von Rhein of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it "one of [Hanson's] most formally innovative" symphonies.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune" /&gt;  Andrew Achenbach of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' similarly wrote, "it boasts a formidable thematic economy and intriguing formal scheme of which Hanson himself was justifiably proud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Achenbach |first=Andrew |title=Music of Howard Hanson - Volume 1 |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=September 1998 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/music-of-howard-hanson-volume-1 |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TRIAD Berlin''' is a German [[exhibition design]] firm based in [[Berlin]] with an office in [[Shanghai]]. The agency is best known for the development of two major sports museums: the [[German Football Museum]] in [[Dortmund]] and the [[FIFA World Football Museum]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/football-in-museums/av-19083717 |title=Football in museums|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Expo 2010 Shanghai, Urban Planet Pavilion.jpg|thumb|''Urban Planet'' pavilion, Expo 2010 Shanghai]]
The Berlin agency was founded in 1994 by Lutz Engelke to realize the exhibition ''The Dream of Vision – Age of Televisions'' at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] in the city of [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/koepfe/triad-berlin-eine-agentur-mit-der-besonderen-dna/12526828.html|title=Eine Agentur mit der besonderen DNA|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=1 November 2015|access-date=2018-03-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the theme pavilion ''[[Expo 2010 pavilions#Urban Planet Pavilion|Urban Planet]]'' at [[Expo 2010]], the company also has an additional permanent office in Shanghai, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-11/02/content_11489135.htm |title=How to build cities with character|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency focusses on spatial communication and sees itself as a ''Think &amp; Do Tank''. Its main goal is to turn complex ideas into tangible experiences. Although the content of the projects varies, the method used for their development is always the same: the creation of stories that can be experienced from abstract ideas. A key component of this process is the development of a narrative that structures the messages and guides the visitor through the exhibition. Most of the times, the [[storytelling]] is enhanced by digital media. TRIAD exhibitions rely heavily on digital interactive exhibits with the intention of bridging the gap between the intellectual learning process and the physical experience. In many cases, TRIAD combines education and entertainment in a multimedia space. The result is the so-called [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], whose goal is to educate through entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Engelke/Osswald, 2017, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIAD has applied edutainment concepts to various projects focused on children's education, such as the 2018 exhibition on the [[MS Wissenschaft]] about working life of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ms-wissenschaft.de/english/ |title=MS Wissenschaft – The Floating Science Center|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the company has used this approach in the [[Brandenburg Gate Museum]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/emotionen-am-tor-the-gate-zeigt-stadtgeschichte-in-einer-multimedia-show/13511474.html|title="The Gate" zeigt Stadtgeschichte in einer Multimedia-Show|access-date=2017-03-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also tackling other challenges that exhibitions face today, like the creation of barrier-free museums. An example of this is the exhibition ''Wilderness Dreams'' in [[Eifel National Park]] which is part of the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.undekade-biologischevielfalt.de/projekte/aktuelle-projekte-beitraege/detail/projekt-details/show/Wettbewerb/1863/?cHash=59202f3f0faf587a430c6400f5b54774&amp;L=0 |title=„Wildnis(t)räume im Nationalpark-Zentrum Eifel|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tate Britain''' (known from 1897 to 1932 as the '''National Gallery of British Art''' and from 1932 to 2000 as the '''Tate Gallery''') is an art museum on [[Millbank]] in the [[City of Westminster]] in London. It is part of the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]] network of galleries in England, with [[Tate Modern]], [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[Tate St Ives]]. It is the oldest gallery in the network, having opened in 1897. It houses a substantial collection of the [[art of the United Kingdom]] since Tudor times, and in particular has large holdings of the works of [[J. M. W. Turner]], who bequeathed all his own collection to the nation. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] museums in the country.

==History==
The gallery is situated on [[Millbank]], on the site of the former [[Millbank Prison]]. Construction, undertaken by [[Higgs and Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49753 'General introduction', Survey of London: volume 26: Lambeth: Southern area (1956), pp. 1–17.] Date accessed: 27 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; commenced in 1893, and the gallery opened on 21 July 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. However, from the start it was commonly known as the Tate Gallery, after its founder [[Sir Henry Tate]], and in 1932 it officially adopted that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#gallery Tate: ''History of Tate – The gallery at Millbank, London''] Linked 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2000, the gallery housed and displayed both British and modern collections, but the launch of [[Tate Modern]] saw Tate's modern collections move there, while the old Millbank gallery became dedicated to the display of historical and contemporary [[British art]]. As a consequence, it was renamed Tate Britain in March 2000.

The front part of the building was designed by [[Sidney R. J. Smith]] with a classical [[portico]] and [[dome]] behind, and the central sculpture gallery was designed by [[John Russell Pope]]. Tate Britain includes the Clore Gallery of 1987, designed by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], which houses work by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. The Clore Gallery has been regarded as an important example of [[Postmodern architecture]], especially in the use of contextual irony: each section of the external facade quotes liberally from the building next to it in regard to materials and detailing.&lt;ref&gt;"British Architecture", ''Architectural Design'', London, 1982, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crises during its existence include flood damage to work from the [[River Thames]], and bomb damage during World War II. However, most of the collection was in safe storage elsewhere during the war, and a large [[Stanley Spencer]] painting, deemed too big to move, had a protective brick wall built in front of it.

In 1970, the building was given [[Listed building|Grade II*]] listed status.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1222913 |desc=Tate Gallery |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tate Britain announced that it had raised the £45&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="Sulcas"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roslyn|last=Sulcas|date=18 November 2013|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/tate-britain-completes-renovation/|title=Tate Britain Completes Renovation|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; required to complete a major renovation, largely thanks to a £4.9&amp;nbsp;million grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and £1&amp;nbsp;million given by Tate Members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18101020|title=Tate Britain hits £45m renovation target|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=17 May 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum stayed open throughout the three phases&lt;ref name="Merrick"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Merrick|date=18 November 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/tate-britains-redesign-it-may-not-be-cool-but-its-restrained-and-elegant-and-it-works-8947624.html|title=Tate Britain's redesign: It may not be cool but it’s restrained, and elegant, and it works|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of renovation.&lt;ref name="Sulcas"/&gt; Completed in 2013, the newly designed sections were conceived by the architects [[Caruso St John]] and included a total of nine new galleries, with reinforced flooring to accommodate heavy sculptures. A second part was unveiled later that year, the centrepiece being the reopening of the building's Thames-facing entrance as well as a new spiral staircase beneath its rotunda.&lt;ref name="Merrick"/&gt; The circular balcony of the rotunda's domed atrium, closed to visitors since the 1920s, was reopened. The gallery also now has a dedicated schools' entrance and reception beneath its entrance steps on Millbank and a new archive gallery for the presentation of temporary displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24987799|title='Transformed' Tate Britain unveiled|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[File:Millbank Pier, London.JPG|thumb|[[Millbank Millennium Pier]] outside Tate Britain, which is linked by a high-speed boat to [[Tate Modern]]]]
The front entrance is accessible by steps. A side entrance at a lower level has a ramp for wheelchair access. The gallery provides a restaurant and a café, as well as a Friends room, open only to members of the Tate. This membership is open to the public on payment of an annual subscription. As well as administration offices the building complex houses the Prints and Drawings Rooms (in the Clore galleries),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/printrooms/ |title=Prints and Drawings Rooms |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Library&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/library "Research services: library"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; and Archive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/library "Research services:archive"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/readingrooms/ "Research services: Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant features a mural by [[Rex Whistler]].

Tate Britain and Tate Modern are now connected by a high speed boat along the [[River Thames]], which runs from [[Millbank Millennium Pier]] immediately outside Tate Britain. The boat is decorated with spots, based on paintings of similar appearance by [[Damien Hirst]]. The lighting artwork incorporated in the pier's structure is by [[Angela Bulloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millbankpier.co.uk |title=Millbank Pier web site |publisher=Millbankpier.co.uk |date=22 May 2003 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
The main display spaces show the permanent collection of historic British art, as well as contemporary work. It has rooms dedicated to works by one artist, such as: [[Tracey Emin]], [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]], [[Douglas Gordon]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]], [[Tacita Dean]], Marcus Gheeraerts II, though these, like the rest of the collection, are subject to rotation.

The gallery also organises career retrospectives of British artists and temporary major exhibitions of British Art. Every three years the gallery stages a Triennial exhibition in which a guest curator provides an overview of contemporary British Art. The 2003 Tate Triennial was called ''Days Like These''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/days-these "Days Like These"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Art Now'' is a small changing show of a contemporary artist's work in a dedicated room.

Tate Britain is the home of the annual and usually controversial [[Turner Prize]] exhibition, featuring four artists selected by a jury chaired by the director of Tate Britain. This is spread out over the year with the four nominees announced in May, the show of their work opened in October and the prize itself given in December. Each stage of the prize generates media coverage, and there have also been a number of demonstrations against the prize, notably since 2000 an [[Stuckist demonstrations|annual picket]] by [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] artists. In recent years the exhibition and award ceremony have taken place at locations other than in Tate Britain: for example in Liverpool (2007), Derry-Londonderry (2013), Glasgow (2015) and Hull (2017).

Tate Britain has attempted to reach out to a different and younger audience with ''Late at Tate Britain'' on the first Friday of every month, with half-price admission to exhibitions, live music and performance art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/eventseries/late-tate-britain "events education"], Tate online.&lt;/ref&gt; Other public involvement has included the display of visitors', as opposed to curators', interpretation of certain artworks.

Regular free tours operate on the hour, and at 1.15&amp;nbsp;pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday short 15-minute talks are given on paintings, artists and artistic styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonboard.co.uk/tate-britain/ Tate Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209223049/http://londonboard.co.uk/tate-britain/ |date=9 February 2012 }}, LondonBoard.co.uk, Accessed 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent collection==

Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art from 1500 to the present day. As such, it is the most comprehensive collection of its kind in the world (only the [[Yale Center for British Art]] can claim similar expansiveness, but with less depth).  More recent artists include [[David Hockney]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]. Works in the permanent Tate collection, which may be on display at Tate Britain include:

==Statue of Millais==
[[File:Millais statue 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[John Everett Millais]] by [[Thomas Brock]] at Tate Britain]]
When the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painter and President of the [[Royal Academy]], [[John Everett Millais]], died in 1896, the Prince of Wales (later to become [[King Edward VII]]) chaired a memorial committee, which commissioned a statue of the artist.&lt;ref name=birchall&gt;Birchall, Heather. [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=27325&amp;searchid=11876&amp;tabview=text "Sir Thomas Brock  1847–1922"], Tate online, February 2002. Retrieved 5 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This was installed at the front of the gallery in the garden on the east side in 1905. On 23 November that year, ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' called it "a breezy statue, representing the man in the characteristic attitude in which we all knew him".&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt;

In 1953, Tate Director, [[Norman Reid (museum director)|Sir Norman Reid]], attempted to have it replaced by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]'s ''John the Baptist'', and in 1962 again proposed its removal, calling its presence "positively harmful". His efforts were frustrated by the statue's owner, the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Ownership was transferred from the Ministry to [[English Heritage]] in 1996, and by them in turn to the Tate.&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt; In 2000 the statue was removed to the rear of the building.&lt;ref name=birchall/&gt;

'''''The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781''''' is a 1783 large [[oil painting]] by [[John Singleton Copley]].  It depicts the death of Major [[Francis Peirson]] at the [[Battle of Jersey]] on 6 January 1781.

The Battle of Jersey was the last French attempt to seize the island of [[Jersey]], and one of the last battles with invading forces from a foreign nation in the British home islands.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746 was the last pitched battle on the British mainland; the [[Battle of Fishguard]] involved a short-lived French invasion of Wales in February 1797; and a French expeditionary force fought at the [[Battle of Ballinamuck]] in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The invasion was organised privately by Baron [[Philippe de Rullecourt]] but funded and supplied by the French government, and was intended to remove the threat that British naval vessel based in Jersey posed to American ships in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Approximately 1,000 French soldiers, commanded by de Rullecourt and an Indian, [[Mir Sayyad]], landed at La Rocque, [[Grouville]], overnight on 5–6 January. They occupied [[St Helier]] early on the morning of 6 January. They captured the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]], [[Moses Corbet]], in bed. Although Corbet surrendered, Peirson, the 24-year-old commander of around 2,000 troops of the British garrison, refused to surrender. As Peirson organised a counter-attack, a French shot killed him. Lieutenant Philippe Dumaresq of the Jersey militia took command of the British forces, which comprised detachments of the [[95th Regiment of Foot (1779)|95th Regiment of Foot]], [[72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders|78th&lt;!--renumbered 72nd in 1786--&gt; Highlanders]], and [[Jersey Militia]]. The British forces quickly overwhelmed the French, most of whom surrendered.

[[John Boydell]], a successful engraver and publisher and [[Aldermen]] of the [[City of London]], commissioned Copley to paint a large painting, {{convert|251.5|cm}} by {{convert|365.8|cm}}. The scene looks towards the final French resistance in [[Royal Square (Jersey)|Royal Square]], viewed along what is now Peirson Place, with the French soldiers taking their last stand around the statue of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. Further British reinforcements are visible on the hill at the top left. The statue and some of the buildings depicted still stand (some with bullet holes  caused by the battle).

Although Peirson was killed in the early stages of the battle, the painting shows Peirson (at the centre of the painting under the large [[Union Flag]], supported by other officers) being shot down leading the final charge, giving him a more heroic role and fate. To the left, his black servant Pompey avenges his master by shooting the sniper. It is believed that the depictions of the officers supporting the stricken Peirson are true portraits; the black servant of auctioneer [[James Christie (auctioneer)|James Christie]] was the model for Pompey, although it is unclear whether a black servant played a role (there is no suggestion in contemporaneous sources). Copley modeled the civilians fleeing to the right on his wife, family nurse and children.

Peirson became a national hero, and the painting drew crowds when it was first exhibited at 28 [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]] in May 1784, with admission charged at 1 shilling.  The [[Tate Gallery]] purchased the painting in 1864. Between 1989 and 2010, a copy appeared on the 10 [[Jersey pound]] note, and before that on the 1 pound note.

'''''The Informers''''' is a collection of [[Short story|short stories]], seemingly linked [[shared universe|by the same continuity]], authored by American author [[Bret Easton Ellis]]. It was first published as a whole in 1994. Chapters 6 and 7, "Water from the Sun" and "Discovering Japan", were published separately in the UK by [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0330445820|title=PICADOR SHOTS - 'Water from the Sun': Discovering Japan: Amazon.co.uk: Bret Easton Ellis: 9780330445825: Books|work=amazon.co.uk|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It displays attributes similar to Ellis' novels ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'', ''[[The Rules of Attraction]],'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[American Psycho]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Like many of Ellis' novels, the stories here are set predominantly in California.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=December 2007}}

=== Chapter 1 - Bruce Calls from Mulholland ===
Nameless protagonist receives a phone call from Bruce, who apologizes for not being in New Hampshire, but in Los Angeles. It has been two months since the last time he contacted her. Bruce mentions how things have deteriorated ever since sleeping with Lauren, the girlfriend of his wealthy roommate, Robert. The affair between the two lasted a week before she moved on to someone wealthier than Robert. Bruce then had an affair with Lauren's brother, Marshall, which lasted longer than his affair with Lauren only because Marshall stayed in the apartment for a week and a half before moving back in with his ex-boyfriend. Bruce ends up moving out of Robert's apartment and into Reynold's due to some of Robert's expensive pet lizards dying, but this is a feeble excuse.

She thinks back to the past summer, when she met Bruce at a workshop, but has few memories of the time spent together. Bruce inquires about an event during that summer that she cannot remember. After the phone call, she meets up with Reynolds for dinner at a Chinese restaurant. Although Reynolds makes conversation, all the protagonist can think about is Bruce, Lauren and Arizona.

=== Chapter 2 - At the Still Point ===
This chapter is narrated by Tim. This may possibly be Tim Price from the novel ''American Psycho'', because as mentioned in ''American Psycho'' Tim is from California, where he went to school at UCLA before dropping out and going to Stanford.

Tim and his friends Raymond, Dirk, and Graham gather at Mario's restaurant, where Raymond recalls that it is the one-year-anniversary of the death of Jamie, a mutual acquaintance of the boys'. Emotions run high as Dirk denies remembering that it is the anniversary, ultimately breaking down and recalling Jamie's death in graphic detail: Dirk was following Jamie's car through the desert when Jamie crashed it, and Dirk pulled Jamie's body from the wreck and waited with it until help arrived.

Raymond becomes upset by the story and retreats to the bathroom to cry, where Tim goes to calm him down. Although Tim acknowledges to the reader that Jamie never liked Raymond, Tim tells him that Jamie considered him a good friend, which cheers Raymond up. Meanwhile, Tim notices inconsistencies in Dirk's story: Although the coroner's report stated that Jamie died instantly when his car crashed, Dirk claims to have watched helplessly as Jamie slowly bled to death. Dirk dismisses the inconsistency as his intentionally trying to upset Raymond for bringing up the accident.

=== Chapter 3 - The Up Escalator ===
This chapter is narrated by the ex-wife of William, and mother of Graham and Susan. Though unnamed in the novel, she is called "Laura" in the film adaptation. The chapter starts out with a dream about the narrator being pushed out the window by her much younger lover Martin. She then awakens and wanders about the house in a daze of Valium. She tries to make conversation with her son and daughter, but fails as they either ignore her, or change the subject. She then eats lunch with Martin, then goes back to his apartment and has sex with him, after which she gives him a pith helmet as a gift.

The next scene is the narrator sitting by the pool observing the pool cleaner. The pool cleaner then finds two dead rats and starts talking to the narrator, who becomes flustered by the conversation. The narrator then has lunch with her friends, in which she daydreams about the pool boy. After this she talks with her daughter Susan who mentions Blair. This may be the same Blair from ''Less Than Zero'' as she would be about the right age and living in LA. The narrator then dreams of drowning rats and pool boys, then wakes up and has more Valium before calling Martin.

The narrator then has lunch with her son and daughter. During this lunch Graham and Susan mention Julian. This again is probably the same Julian from ''Less Than Zero''; as he would be about the right age, deals heroin, and is mentioned to be a male prostitute. The next section is where the narrator gets a call from her mother. They discuss her mother's health and the narrator remembers a Christmas from her childhood.

Next the narrator meets with her psychiatrist so she can get her prescriptions filled. She then follows her son Graham and watches him score drugs. She then talks with Martin about how she is friend with his mother, then loans him money to pay for Billy Idol tickets. After this her husband William and she are getting ready to go to a party. She contemplates filling William's insulin shot with air to kill him, because they just had a fight. Once at the party she mentions seeing the rock star's wife who tried to kill herself. This is most likely Bryan Metro's wife who also tries to kill herself and is discussed in the chapter Discovering Japan.

=== Chapter 4 - In the Islands ===
This chapter is narrated by Les Price, the father of Tim Price from previous chapters. The chapter begins with Les on the phone with a man who is referred to by what sounds like a surname, Lynch. Les is watching Tim and Graham stand in line for a movie through the mirrored window in his office. While he watches the two boys, he begins to see signs that the two boys he thinks are friends, may have a more physical relationship. Les gets a phone call from his ex-wife Elena, who informs him that Tim does not want to go to on the trip to [[Mauna Kea Beach Hotel|Mauna Kea]].  The next day, Les picks up Tim in his limousine and, after Les makes some attempts to talk to him and fails, they go to the airport.

After Tim and his father arrive in Hawaii, they eat at the Mauna Kea restaurant and his father once again tries unsuccessfully to make conversation with Tim. Once dinner ends, they go walking around the hotel until they meet two ladies from Chicago at the bar. Les tries unsuccessfully to pick up on the two ladies, and Tim gets upset at his father's actions and leaves. They play tennis and Les wins every set, which Tim shrugs off. They go to the beach and relax in the sun, until Tim meets a girl his age, named Rachel. Later that evening, Tim and his father have dinner with Rachel. Les tries to pick up Rachel during the dinner, at which point Tim freaks out and leaves. Tim's dad finds him up in their room smoking marijuana, causing him to attempt in vain to apologize.  Les has been crying, possibly motivated by guilt. Les wanders around the hotel and once again meets Rachel. Les talks with her about manta rays and Tim. The chapter ends with Tim and Les sitting on the beach staring at the ocean.

=== Chapter 5 - Sitting Still ===
The chapter involves Susan, the sister of Graham and daughter of William, going to Los Angeles by train to her father's wedding. She remembers the conversation she has with her father asking if she approved of his marriage to Cheryl. The father also admits never telling the mother of the marriage and that a divorce has never been finalized. Since the father hardly ever talks about Cheryl in detail the girl gets most of her information from Graham. She also mentions that one summer she had spent time with Cheryl.

She tells her father—or rather lets him assume—that she likes Cheryl; but in a phone conversation with Graham later on in the chapter, she describes how she believes it is a bad idea for them to get married and how much she disapproves of it. Later in the story, the narrator calls her mother and discovers that she had not heard about the wedding. At the end of the chapter, she leaves Los Angeles giving the reader the impression that she travelled there but then decided not to stay, instead planning to return by train to Camden College. The character of Susan had previously made an appearance in ''The Rules of Attraction'', sleeping with Sean Bateman.

=== Chapter 6 - Water from the Sun ===
Chapter about Cheryl Laine, a news anchor with a complicated love life. She married William, but they separated after he left her for a woman named "Linda". The chronology of all this is unclear, as are Cheryl's age and Linda's current significance (or lack thereof) in William's life. It is clear that Cheryl views William as an ex, however. Due to her high-profile career, Cheryl is recognized in public places. Like William's (other) ex-wife (Graham's mother), Cheryl has now started sleeping with much younger men who are using her for food and shelter.

She must remind her boyfriend Danny to record her newscasts, as she feels they are the only opportunity for him to look at her nowadays. Danny informs her that Ricky, the boyfriend of Danny's pal, Biff, has been murdered. Neither Cheryl nor Danny truly seem to care, though Danny claims he does. Throughout the story, William tries to reconcile his marriage with Cheryl, pleading that he's changed. She tells him, however, that she's happier with Danny despite her own fears he may be more attracted to Biff than to her. Danny, in turn, abruptly dumps her by a note left in her apartment, and suggests she hook up with Biff.

=== Chapter 7 - Discovering Japan ===
Burned out rock star Bryan Metro—the father of a friend of Martin's and the ex-husband of a woman Graham's mother is friends with—travels to Japan on his world tour, where he beats up groupies, rapes hotel maids, has sex with underage girls, and engages in drug-induced acts of self-mutilation. In a constant, drug-and-alcohol induced stupor, he attempts to negotiate the future of his career with his savvy, world-weary agent, who wants Bryan to team up with an up-and-coming band known as the English Prices. Bryan proves resistant, and is too focused on his own self-indulgence to care. Lost in the past, Bryan makes unsuccessful attempts to reconcile via phone with his ex-wife and son, and meditates on the suicide of one of his former bandmates, an event left out of a well-received documentary film about the events leading to the band's dissolution. Bryan ultimately completes the tour after a disastrous show (during which he forgets the words to his own songs) and prepares to head back to America.

=== Chapter 8 - Letters from L.A. ===
This section is a series of letters from a character named Anne, who is a 20-year-old student at Camden College taking a semester (or more) off in Los Angeles with her grandparents, to Sean (character Sean Bateman from ''The Rules of Attraction''). The letters span from September to January and decrease in frequency. Anne undergoes drastic physical, emotional, and mental changes, being indoctrinated into the often detached and morally hollow Los Angeles mindset. Among other things, Anne specifically details her friendship with 30-year-old named Randy. She practically lives at his house much of the time and describes him as a sort of best friend, constantly writing about him in the letters. Yet she seems pretty unaffected when he is found dead (possibly murdered) and mentions it in passing as a minor detail. Physically she changes from a brunette, pale, scholarly and sensitive college student to blonde, tan, vapid and disillusioned aerobics junkie.

=== Chapter 9 - Another Gray Area ===
Graham lives in an apartment with his girlfriend, Christie, and two other boys, Randy and Martin, the latter of whom is having an affair with Graham's mother and with whom Graham is also having sex. Graham is further convinced that Christie and Martin are having sex, but does not care.

Graham visits Martin at a building where Martin is filming a music video for the English Prices, whose stoned lead singer proves difficult to work with. Later he has lunch with Christie, who tells him that a friend of theirs has been found dead in Mexico, severely mutilated and drained of blood. The two argue about their relationship, ultimately concluding that neither cares if the other has sex with different people.

One morning Graham goes downstairs to discover that a hostage situation is unfolding across the street involving numerous police officers; Graham dismissively watches it unfold along with the doorman, who wants to be introduced to Martin so that he can get into music videos. Graham ultimately goes back upstairs, ignoring the outcome of the hostage situation. Later, he receives word that his father has been killed in a plane crash, and travels out to Las Vegas to see the body and visit the accident site. Afterwards he gambles most of his money away at different Casinos, and ultimately loses most of his father's ashes after betting them on a game of Blackjack.

=== Chapter 10 - The Secrets of Summer ===
Chapter 10 flashes back to the life of Jamie, whose death was recounted earlier. Jamie is a sexist, racist young playboy fond of making jokes about [[Ethiopia]]ns. Throughout the course of the story, it becomes clear that Jamie either is, or at least believes himself to be, a [[vampire]], who sleeps in a coffin outfitted with cable television and survives on raw [[filet mignon]] and by drinking the blood of teenage girls during sex. He is part of an apparent [[secret society]] of other "vampires," including socialite Miranda and his friend, Dirk, who has taken vampirism to the extreme by killing his victims rather than simply draining and drinking their blood.

Visiting Dirk, Jamie discovers various mutilated body parts that indicate him as the serial killer responsible for deaths mentioned in several previous stories. Jamie and Dirk uncomfortably recall the fate of Roderick, who disappeared at the same time a pile of ashes were found at the bottom of his pool, near a wooden stake and [[Lawry's and Adolph's|Lawry's]] garlic powder. The next time Jamie picks up a girl he discovers that she is more perceptive to his racism and lifestyle than his other conquests, which causes him to snap and murder her.

In the last section, Jamie goes to visit his psychiatrist, Dr. Nova, whom he asks for more [[Darvocet]]. Jamie taunts the psychiatrist by claiming responsibility for his father's death; Dr. Nova calmly dismisses the story as one Jamie has told before, casting doubt on Jamie's reliability as a narrator. Jamie then threatens to kill Dr. Nova's daughter, spurring him to write the prescription. Before leaving, Jamie claims to be the biblical demon [[Legion (demons)|Legion]].

=== Chapter 11 - The Fifth Wheel ===
A car wash attendant, Tommy, gets a call from an old acquaintance of his, Peter, who wants to stay at his place while he visits the city. Tommy agrees, and Peter shows up later along with his girlfriend, a heroin addict named Mary who takes to sleeping on a mattress on the floor of Tommy's room. Initially, Peter and Mary only prove to be a minor nuisance, as the [[morbidly obese]] Peter binge-eats all day and watches cartoons while Mary shoots up in the bedroom. One afternoon, however, Tommy comes home to discover a ten-year-old boy tied up in the bathtub; Peter explains that he owes money to a drug dealer named Spin, and explains that the child—whom he and Mary kidnapped from the mall—is part of a plan to raise money to pay off the debt. Tommy initially protests, prompting Peter to assault him. Tommy quickly grows too apathetic to intervene, and simply takes to urinating in his kitchen sink and defecating at a nearby gas station as a way to avoid the bathroom.

As time goes on it becomes apparent that Peter has no real plan to use the child as a means of income; he never makes ransom demands from the child's parents, and only briefly considers selling him to the vampires in Los Angeles, before deciding to use the boy as his own personal sex slave. The sight of the child's bloody body after being raped by Peter only causes Tommy to become more apathetic.

One night, left alone with Mary, Tommy attempts to have sex with her. Mary tells him that the last time the couple found themselves in a similar situation, she had sex with their host, prompting Peter to shoot him in the eye and castrate him. Nevertheless, Tommy still attempts to have sex with her, an effort that fails when she passes out from heroin.

After Spin shows up and threatens Tommy, Peter decides to flee to Las Vegas, and asks Tommy to come along with. Before they leave, he encourages Tommy to murder the child to tie up loose ends. Tommy initially refuses, but is too apathetic to keep up his protest, and obligingly stabs the boy to death. The trio flee into the desert, where Peter reminds Tommy that the child's death is on his hands, and not Peter's. When Tommy brings up the man that Peter shot and castrated, Peter is genuinely confused, and indicates he does not know what Tommy is talking about.

=== Chapter 12 - On the Beach ===
An unnamed protagonist spends his days with his dying girlfriend, who wants to spend the time she has left on the beach at her mother's house in Malibu. The protagonist meditates upon his girlfriend's rapidly deteriorating condition, which she first exhibited at their senior prom, and which he attended while high.

Keeping the couple company are the girlfriend's best friend, Mona, and a seemingly endless string of young men that Mona brings home. The latest, Griffin, clashes with the narrator by drinking all of his beer, exacerbating the already tense situation. After sleeping with Mona, the narrator informs her of his ambivalence towards his girlfriend, and his decision to leave the next day: Her impending death reminds him too much of his own mortality, and the prospect of being around to witness it is too frightening.

The narrator visits his girlfriend one last time as she lays weakly on the beach, watching the sunset, listlessly begging to be allowed to work on her tan. The narrator quietly walks away, leaving her alone and contemplating his own mortality.

=== Chapter 13 - At the Zoo with Bruce ===
An unnamed protagonist spends the day at the zoo with her married lover, Bruce, a television writer who has been using her for money and sex while promising to leave his wife. Over the course of the day, the narrator finds parallels between the various injured zoo animals they encounter and her own life situation, as her attempts to leave Bruce all end with Bruce begging her not to and the narrator ultimately relenting.

When the narrator finally tries to confront Bruce about leaving his wife, Bruce tells her a long, convoluted story about being an alien sent to Earth to prepare for its destruction in the 24th century. Leaving the zoo, the narrator contemplates finally living a life independent of Bruce, but sees no immediate release from the situation.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|The Informers (2008 film)}}
A film version of the book has been produced from a script by Ellis and [[Nicholas Jarecki]] and was screened at the 2009 Sundance film festival. It was directed by [[Gregor Jordan]] and featured an [[ensemble cast]], such as [[Winona Ryder]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Amber Heard]] and [[Kim Basinger]]. It was [[Brad Renfro]]'s last film before his death.

==Criticism==
Reviewing the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Michiko Kakutani]] wrote that Ellis had written "a novel that is as cynical, shallow and stupid as the people it depicts." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/books/books-of-the-times-some-familiar-terrain-after-american-psycho.html&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'', [[Will Self]] said that "The Informers shows the work of a writer at the peak of his powers, deeply concerned with the moral decline of our society."&lt;ref&gt;Evening Standard (London)  October 13, 1994  BEYOND THE AMERICAN PSYCHO BACKLASH; (1) It's all there on WILL SELF's Sanyo M1118 cassette tape recorder - an interview in which the received image of Bret Easton Ellis, the author of the reviled American Psycho, is put to death (2) This is a man whom I'd happily let bath my children - should he wish to engage in such an atrocity (3) The Informers shows the work of a writer deeply concerned with the moral decline of our society  BYLINE: Will Self 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Life of Henry Brulard''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Vie de Henri Brulard'''}}) is an unfinished autobiography by [[Stendhal]]. It was begun on November 23, 1835 and abandoned March 26, 1836 while the author was serving as the French [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Civitavecchia]]. Stendhal had severe doubts about contemporary interest in his autobiography, so he bequeathed it to the reader of 1880, or of 1935, or 2000. The manuscript, including Stendhal's numerous diagrams and illustrations, was published in 1890. Stendhal primariliy discusses his unhappy and dull childhood, touching briefly on his time as a soldier. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is considered a masterpiece of  autobiographical writing and ironic self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Life-of-Henry-Brulard |title=The Life of Henry Brulard  |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/13/classics.nicholaslezard |title=Witty once a week:Nicholas Lezard on ''The Life of Henry Brulard'', Stendhal's rambunctious memoir |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 13, 2002 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''The Life of Henry Brulard'' begins in 1832, with Stendhal on the [[Janiculum]] (named for [[Janus]], the two-faced god of beginnings) looking down at [[Rome]]. He begins questioning his accomplishments as he approaches 50 years of age. He reflects on the churches and monuments of the city and how much they have changed since he was a young man. He heads home through a cold mist at night and decides he will reflect upon his past until its truth emerges. He also decides to write as fast as he can without revising, to avoid lies. He believes a quickly-written rough draft would, like [[automatic writing]], disclose the truth about himself. Stendhal explicitly compares himself with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and calls ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' his own ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=97 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Stendhal was 52 years old when he began the memoir and the first scene is a small fiction. The  first chapter was written in two days in November 1835, and Stendhal also claims that ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is an imitation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Oliver Goldsmith's]] novel ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=103–104 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stendhal notes at the start that other men's biographies naturally focus on their public career. Stendhal himself campaigned with Napoleon in Russia and became consul at [[Civitavecchia]]. But Stendhal asserts that his real life can be found in a list of names: Virginie, Angela, Adele, Melanie, Mina, Alexandrine, Angelina, Metilde, Clementine, Giulia, Madame Azur, Amalia. Stendhal says that none of these women ever honored him with her favors and, despite others who did, the “habitual condition of my life is that of an unhappy lover.”

Stendhal forthrightly admits to wanting to sleep with his mother, who died when he was seven. While discussing his childhood in [[Grenoble]], Stendhal describes how Eighteenth-century French society habitually crushed his natural feelings. He often compares his father to a tyrant or king, on slender pretenses: young Henry is not allowed to play with other kids, not allowed to leave home at age 10, and must accompany his father on walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=146 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal's descriptions of scenes from his youth often provoke present-moment commentaries, blurring together the feelings of a young boy and the reflections of a middle-aged man. 

Stendhal only found happiness when he crossed the Alps into Italy as a 17-year-old in Napoleon's army. Stendhal describes the first time in his life that he mounted a horse, which went berserk and ran towards the willows on the shore of [[Lake Geneva]]. For a quarter of an hour he was in fear of breaking his neck. This became a favorite motif of Stendhal's; the heroes of ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[Lucien Leuwen]]'', and ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'' all fall off their horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vizinczey |first=Stephen  |date=February 20, 1986 |title=Lucky Lucien |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v08/n03/stephen-vizinczey/lucky-lucien |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=17–18 |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal loved Italy, which he considered a land where his truest self could be freely expressive without fear of reprisals. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' ends with the beginning Stendhal's love for Italy and his mistress Angela Pietragrua, countess Simonetta. Stendhal asks, "How can I talk reasonably about those times? I prefer to put it off until another day...What does one do? How does one describe one's wildest happiness?" Stendhal ends the work by saying, "One spoils such tender feelings by recounting them in detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=98 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/the-life-of-henry-brulard|title=The Life of Henry Brulard, Essay by Michael Dirda|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Review |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Founding (1991-2005) ===
Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].  The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an [[Honorary Consul]] for the [[Russian Federation]] in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions "to international cultural diversity and education," both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's [[Order of Friendship|Order of Friendship Medal]], the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a [[Congregational church]] and funeral home. The building received special recognition for [[adaptive reuse]] from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes {{convert|18,000|sqft|m2}} of display galleries and administrative offices.

TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including [[Rossotrudnichestvo]], the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Russian Embassy in the United States]] - Washington D.C., the [[Russian Cultural Center]], the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow), [[State Russian Museum]] (St. Petersburg), [[State Museum of Yaroslaval]] (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-russia-create-a-way-to-skirt-russian-arts-embargo/329721831/|title=Minnesota, Russia create a way to skirt Russian arts embargo|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to its exhibition calendar, TMORA hosts a variety of events throughout the year including concerts, lectures, theater, dance, artist talks, book clubs, and an annual vodka tasting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

On March 6, 2018, the museum's former Director Vladimir von Tsurikov, Ph.D., received the Silver Archer "[http://www.luchnik.ru/ СЕРЕБРЯНЫЙ ЛУЧНИК]" award at the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C. for his leadership of over 30 programs at TMORA in 2017: "In recognition of his work advancing creative activities contributing to Cultural Diplomacy in the United States during a time of cooling bilateral relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmora.org/2018/04/04/silverarcher/|title=Director Honored with “Silver Archer” award in D.C.|date=2018-04-04|work=The Museum of Russian Art|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">'''''The Saturday Book''''' was an annual [[miscellany]], published from 1941 to 1975, reaching 34 volumes. It was edited initially by [[Leonard Russell (journalist)|Leonard Russell]]  and from 1952 by [[John Hadfield]].  A final compilation, ''The Best of the Saturday Book'', was published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;John Hadfield (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qvg7AAAAIAAJ ''The Best of the Saturday Book''], Hutchinson {{ISBN|978-0-09145-990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher throughout was [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson's]]. 

''The Saturday Book'' provided literary and artistic commentary about life in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Second World War]] and the ensuing decades. It covered a range of arts, including [[ballet]] and music.  Many writers contributed poems as well as [[essay]]s.

The very first volume totaled 444 pages, but, with paper in short supply,  the length of the second was slashed to 274 pages. From the third to the 24th volumes the number fluctuated between 288 and 304 pages, but the remaining ten ran to no more than 256 pages each, with the last one dropping to 240 pages.  

In 2002 Nekta Publications published ''What's Where in The Saturday Books: A Comprehensive Guide and Index'' by Peter Rowland, 154 pages long, which  provides an index and guide to the whole series.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rowland (2002) ''What's Where in The Saturday Books'', Nekta Publications (Limited Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
The many writers who contributed to the series included [[H. E. Bates]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[John Masefield]], [[H. J. Massingham]], [[George Orwell]], [[J. B. Priestley]], [[L. T. C. Rolt]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. 

The series was profusely illustrated with photographs, woodcuts and line drawings, many specially commissioned. Artists included [[Edward Ardizzone]], [[Roland Emmett]], [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Lawrence Scarfe]] and [[Richard Chopping]]. Photographers included [[Bill Brandt]], [[Cecil Beaton]], [[Douglas Glass]] and [[Edwin Smith (photographer)|Edwin Smith]]. Wood engravers included [[Robert Gibbings]], [[George Maclay]] and [[Agnes Miller Parker]].

[[George Orwell]]'s essay "Benefit of Clergy", intended for the volume published in 1944, was suppressed on grounds of obscenity, but its title remains in the table of contents.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell (1944) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521092041/http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/essay/CriticalEssays/salvadordali.html "Benefit Of Clergy: Some Notes On Salvador Dali"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatrical constraints''' are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of [[Play (theatre)|stage play]]s in the [[theater]].   Whether imposed externally, by virtue of [[monopoly]] franchises or [[censorship]] laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, [[theatre director|director]]s, or [[theatrical producer|producer]]s, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to  tackle the challenges of working with and around them.

The [[Classical unities]], requiring "unity" of "time, place, and subject", is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints.  It was first employed by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and later became more fully embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create "[[Kabuki|Onnagata]]" which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition.  In the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] theatre of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys.  The plot of ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' turns on this fact.

In [[film|cinema]], the [[Dogme 95]] films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen.

Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France.  In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors – strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place – took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.

But this aroused the jealousy of the [[Comédie-Française]] which decided to outlaw all spoken dialogue except in its own theatre. To overcome this, the travelling players divided their plays into soliloquies and performed nothing but monologues – which brought them even greater success than previously.   One actor would say his lines, run off into the wings, while another appeared in order to reply. He would then go off in his turn, allowing the first one to come back and reply, and so on and so forth.

After this, the Comédie-Française declared that they alone had the right to use speech on stage. Consequently, the public theatre found its way round this by using song instead of speech – and this is how French [[Operetta]] came into being. But then the Academy of Music proclaimed that they alone should be given the right to sing!

So in the markets and fairgrounds the itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or [[karaoke]]) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship.

Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if [[Marcel Carné]]'s ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' is a reliable guide.  This also explains why France has given the world so many [[mime artist|mime]]s.

'''''Twilight in the Wilderness''''' is an 1860 oil painting by American painter [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. The woodlands of the northeastern United States are shown against a setting sun that intensely colors the dramatic [[altocumulus cloud]]s. Church scholar John K. Howat describes the painting as "one of his finest ever"&lt;ref&gt;Howat (2005), 99&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the single most impressive example of Church's depictions of unsullied North American woodlands and their most famous representation in nineteenth-century painting".&lt;ref&gt;Howat (1987), 251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

Painted during a time of increasing American interest in unspoiled nature—Thoreau's ''[[Walden]]'' was published in 1854—there are no signs of human activity in this landscape; the only life is a small bird perched at left. Like many of Church's paintings, the picture is likely a composite of sketches taken in the field, especially in [[Maine]], which he visited often. He travelled many times in the 1850s to [[Mount Desert Island]] and [[Mount Katahdin]], then an especially remote area.&lt;ref name="h97-52"/&gt;

Like Church's other major works, it is a highly detailed view of nature. The sky is painted in skillful gradations of purples, oranges, and yellows,&lt;ref name="h97-52"&gt;Howat (1987), 252&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects the influence of the popular English landscapist [[J. M. W. Turner]] on Church.&lt;ref name="s57"&gt;Sweeney, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Improved oil colors may have helped Church achieve the effect.

In terms of the [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminist]] style, with which Church is sometimes associated, the artistic achievement in the painted sky is the culmination of his many earlier pictures of sunsets and sunrises. David C. Huntington, Church's "re-discoverer" in the 1960s, writes that "there is no [longer a] surfeit of pigment; no unnatural border inadvertently solidifies the cloud vapors ... In ''Twilight in the Wilderness'' the discipline of careful study achieved its consummation."&lt;ref&gt;Huntington (1989), 169&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of imposing "paintiness" contributes to the effect of a camera-like clarity that leaves the personality of the painter scarcely discernible, as one contemporary reviewer noted:

{{quote|He has attained the distinction—that rarest distinction—of being a painter without a manner, almost without a style. His pictures are not tinged with his own personality. He paints, not nature according to Mr. Church, but simply nature. His eye, like every other man's, is a camera with a brain behind it; but his brain gives him the power to transfer to canvas the vanishing forms and tints and shadows thrown upon his eye, unaffected by the medium through which they have passed, except by selection, combination, and unification.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown reviewer quoted in Huntington (1989), 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whether this approach to painting, an aspect of Luminism, was commendable depends on the critic. The quoted review ends, "It is this absence of any signs of mood or manner in his works that we attribute the charm of a deficiency in feeling which is sometimes brought against him." Huntington responds, "The dissemblance of art has so enthralled the critic that the mood, the feeling of ''Twilight in the Wilderness'' elude his recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Huntington (1989), 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and interpretation==
[[File:Sanford Robinson Gifford - Twilight in the Catskill - 2007.178.1 - Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Sanford Robinson Gifford]]'s ''A Twilight in the Catskills'' (1861)]]

In 1860 the painting was exhibited from June 8 to July 25 at [[Goupil &amp; Cie|Goupil's]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 164&lt;/ref&gt; It was well received, with contemporary viewers relating its purity of nature with spirituality. Critics described it as a "scene unhistoric, with no other interest than that of a wilderness, without human association of any kind" and "Nature with folded hands, kneeling at her evening prayer".&lt;ref name="s57"/&gt; Others saw "merely" nature, such as the ''Cosmopolitan Art Journal'', which called it "unworthy of the artist, being a mere piece of scene painting, which it was a vanity to exhibit".&lt;ref name="h97-52"/&gt;

Huntington emphasized the connection between pristine wilderness and the cultural sense of [[American exceptionalism]]. He highlighted the painting tradition that Church incorporated, and reinvented, for a uniquely American art: 

{{quote|[''Twilight in the Wilderness''] was his final solution to the heroic representation of the New World's classic image.... Church had learned what he could from [[Thomas Cole|Cole]] and from the [[Dusseldorf school|Dusseldorf painters]]. Turner, [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], and the Old Masters were the influences which would henceforth guide Church to his maturity.... in ''Twilight in the Wilderness'', Church for the first time presented this all-important American subject at the level of [[history painting|history-painting]] in the Great Tradition—an Adamic [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]. He caused the trees in this painting to act like the figures in the Old Masters he collected; yet the trees appear to be perfectly natural.... To create it, Church may well have heeded Ruskin's counsel that the artist should respond to the spiritual message suggested in nature's transcendent moments.... According to American doctrine, pure nature's "transcendent moments" should be accessible to all: no need for an Anglican "High Priest of Nature" to intercede between man and his universe.... As New World man and therefore "Nature's favorite," he was quite content with nature as she was.... His responsibility to humanity on this side of the Atlantic was not to manipulate but to re-create nature, quintessential nature.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington (1966), 79&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For receptive viewers, the painting contains discrete religious symbols: the tree stump is a "wilderness altar" on which there is a small cross formed of wood splinters, and the outline of an angel is apparent; the three trees that frame the scene at right symbolize the three crosses at [[Calvary]]. Huntington suggests that a small cloud fragment (or alternately a small gap in the clouds), located by following the line of the tree stump, evokes the "Dove of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]".&lt;ref name="s57"/&gt; 

The American wilderness and turbulent sky pictured here, as night descends, have been interpreted apocalyptically, as a metaphor for a country falling into discord on the brink of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In this context, the painting is considered patriotic. [[Sanford Robinson Gifford]]'s ''A Twilight in the Catskills'' (1860) has been interpreted similarly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenhalgh |first=Adam |date=2001 |title='Darkness Visible': A Twilight in the Catskills by Sanford Robinson Gifford |journal=American Art Journal |volume=32 |issue=1/2 |pages=45–75 |doi=10.2307/1594639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
''Twilight in the Wilderness'' was commissioned for [[William T. Walters]].   It was acquired by [[John Taylor Johnston]] in 1866, and then sold to [[John Work Garrett]] in 1876.  It was inherited by his daughter [[Mary Garrett]], and sold to family friend (and John Taylor Johnston's son-in-law) [[Robert W. DeForest|Robert de Forest]].  His brother [[Lockwood de Forest]] inherited it in 1931, and the painting descended through the  family until sold by Lockwood's grandson in the 1960s. It was bought by the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://clevelandart.org/art/1965.233 |title=Twilight in the Wilderness |website= Cleveland Museum of Art |access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Art Rating''' is a reference book published since 1999 by [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] as one of the instruments of art market regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Чтобы как-то стабилизировать ценообразование на арт-рынке, Профессиональный союз художников с 1999 года издает "Единый художественный рейтинг". В него входят имена, даты жизни и рейтинговые категории почти 40 тыс. художников Российской империи, СССР, русского зарубежья, Российской Федерации и республик бывшего Советского Союза. Живые и ушедшие — вперемешку. "Делить художников по принципу "жив или мертв" неправильно: с точки зрения ценообразования смерть мастера не самый значительный фактор",— рассказывает Сергей Заграевский. Тем не менее высшую часть пирамиды рейтинга формируют великие мастера прошлого. Основание пирамиды — растущие молодые художники или инертная масса работников изобразительного цеха, которые не участвуют в бурной выставочной жизни. Эксперты, занимающиеся составлением рейтинга, отслеживают динамику роста или деградации тех и других. Живопись — это не теннис, и здесь, конечно, трудно быть уверенным, кто кого обыграет… И все же справочник во многом — зеркало ценообразования: середнячки редко бывают богаты". ([http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1028246 Ксения Гулиа. Картинная лотерея. Журнал «Деньги», № 37(692) от 22.09.2008])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Проект «Арт—рейтинг» может помочь «войти» и в современное искусство, и в сложный процесс арт—рынка. В Арт—рейтинге — в Едином художественном рейтинге Профессионального союза художников — сделана некая попытка классификации: расположить художников по уровню реализации их дарования с учетом, конечно, участия в престижных выставках, внимания к ним средств массовой информации, искусствоведов, музейных работников, членства в союзах, творческих объединениях и прочее... Подобная попытка поставить художников в ряд «по росту» может показаться безнадежной. Но она удалась. Поставленная задача решена, правда, без особых претензий на полную строгость и объективность, что и хорошо".([http://www.artcitiez.com/index.php?id=813 Журнал «Арт Город», № 1 (24), 2010])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Оценивая современную живопись, из-за отсутствия аукционов галеристы и покупатели руководствуются художественным рейтингом. Рейтинг в данном случае понимается как попытка со стороны экспертов стратифицировать творчество художников. Наиболее полным на сегодняшний день рейтингом как украинских, так и российских художников является «Единый художественный рейтинг»".

== Principles of rating ==
The Rating Centre acts under Artists Trade Union of Russia and has a status of an independent professional jury, free in its judges and estimations. Defining rating categories is made on the basis of all available information about works of art, biographies, expositions, collections and sales of works, catalogues and Internet and press publications, art historians' and art-managers' opinions, public opinion polls etc.

United Art Rating consists of 2 sections:
*Russian Art Rating (Rating of artists of Russian Empire, the USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of the former Soviet Union);
*International Artists Rating (All-world Rating of artists of 18th–21st centuries, forming the world art heritage).

Artists are subdivided into categories "A" and "B": an artist of "A" category does not virtually submit to the market's demand. an artist of "B" category is mainly oriented to the market demand.

Each category has its levels from the first (the top of recognition and fame; is referred to the deceased classic artists, whose works of art are widely recognized in museums) to the seventh one (amateur artist).

According to the declared principles, defining of rating categories is made on available information about expositions, sales and collections of works, catalogues, publications, biographies, public-opinion polls etc. Rating criteria are: art level of works, their humanistic significance, professionalism, exhibitions, works in museums, recognition by the public, galleries and art critics, social and civil significance of works, price level of works etc.

United Art Rating contains pricing recommendations about sale and purchase of works of art.

United Art Rating is constantly changed, refined and supplemented.

== Description of rating categories ==
*1 – an artist of world fame, tested with time (for no less than a century).
*1A – a world-famous artist.
*1B – a high-class professional artist with remarkable organizational skills, who is popular and in demand.

== International Art Rating ==
International Art Rating includes the first three categories of United Art Rating (i.e. 1, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B). These artists formed and are forming the history of world art of 18th–21st centuries.

International Art Rating includes artists of [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and former Soviet republics, the republics of the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[United States]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Japan]] and some other countries, such as [[Namibia]].

All famous artists of the period mentioned in the project are represented such as [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Andy Warhol]] just to name a few. From [[Namibia]] e.g. the artists [[Adolph Jentsch]], [[Hans Anton Aschenborn]], [[Dieter Aschenborn]] and [[Uli Aschenborn]] are listed in the project (see '' 'Internet-project' '' under ''' 'External links' ''' below). The art of the rated artists form the world art heritage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10978">'''Women's Art Resources of Minnesota''' ('''WARM''') is a women's art organization based in the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]]. It was founded in 1976 as '''Women's Art Registry of Minnesota''', a [[feminist art|feminist]] [[artist collective]]. The organization ran the influential WARM Gallery in downtown Minneapolis from 1976 to 1991.

==History==

===Early years===
WARM has its origins in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]] of the early 1970s. Gatherings in the studios and homes of [[women artists]] in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] led to the beginning of the Women's Art Registry of Minnesota in the winter of 1973 with the establishment of a slide registry of women artists from Minnesota by Lynn Lockie Warkov and Susan Fiene.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=13}} The group organized their own exhibitions and gathered statistics on the representation of women in the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]] and the [[Walker Art Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Meredith A.|title="The Enemies of Women’s Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed": A.I.R. Gallery’s Role in the American Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/essay/meredith-brown|publisher=Archives of American Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year artist [[Judy Chicago]] spoke at the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[College of St. Catherine]] about her [[Feminist Art Program]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. The next year Chicago, [[Miriam Shapiro]], and educators from the College of St. Catherine laid the foundations for WARM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Jennie|title=Doin' It in Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=132|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0129}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Mid-west Women's Artists' Conference in Michigan in 1975, attendees from Minneapolis learned about the practicalities of maintaining a cooperatively run gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=Toward a History of Feminism, Art, and Social Movements in the United States|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=30|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota was founded as a [[artist cooperative|cooperative]] by 37 [[women artists]] in 1976. It was the first feminist art cooperative in Minnesota.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=3}} The group was non-hierarchical, with all members serving on the organization's governing body.&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt; They registered as a non-profit on January 28, 1976. They limited the membership to 40 people, who were required to pay dues, attend monthly meetings, and spend at least 300 hours annually on activities related to the organization and gallery.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=27–28}}

===WARM Gallery (1976–1991)===
In 1976 the WARM collective established WARM: A Women's Collective Artspace (also known as the WARM Gallery) in a former millinery store in Minneapolis' [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] in the Wyman Building at 414 First Avenue North.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=21}} In 1972 New York City's [[A.I.R. Gallery]] had become the first women's cooperative gallery in the United States. WARM Gallery was one of number of cooperative artist galleries established by women using A.I.R. as a model. The WARM Gallery hosted solo and group exhibitions by invited women artists and from its membership. Visiting artists at the gallery included the painters [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Joan Semmel]] and [[Joan Snyder]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=38–39}}

WARM began offering the Feminist Perspectives monthly lecture series in 1980. The program was directed by Joyce Lyon and succeeded in bringing art critics and historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Lucy Lippard]], and [[Germaine Greer]] through the group's visiting artists program. The series continued until 1984.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=51–52}}&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyon|first1=Joyce|last2=Erickson|first2=Elizabeth|title='The House We Built: Feminist Art Then and Now'|url=http://www.womenspress.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=22&amp;ArticleID=4243|work=Minnesota Women's Press|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the WARM newsletter expanded to the quarterly ''WARM Journal''. Designed by [[Patricia Olson]], the periodical featured fiction and poetry from Minnesota women in addition to articles on art. The journal's editorial committee was chaired by Susan McDonald, Alice Towle, Marty Nash and Elizabeth Erickson until 1985 when Phyllis Wiener took over. By 1985 the journal's circulation had risen to nearly 5000.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=58–59}} Informed by [[cultural feminism]], ''WARM Journal'' was one of the few interdisciplinary publications in the area and for a time it was the only art magazine published regularly in the Twin Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiarmonte|first1=Paula L.|title=Women Artists: A Resource and Research Guide|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=October 1982|volume=1|issue=5|page=A-15|jstor=27947012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''WARM Journal'' ceased publication in 1987.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=58}}

Catherine Jordan was hired as the gallery's coordinator in 1981. She became executive director of WARM the following year.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umolu|first1=Yesomi|title=WARM in the ’80s Then &amp; Now: Catherine Jordan on Art, AIDS, and Feminism in the Twin Cities|url=http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2012/catherine-jordan-minneapolis-feminist-art-aid|publisher=Walker Art Center|date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective established the WARM Mentor Program in 1982. Emerging artists are paired with professionals for the two-year program. A more intensive program, the WARM Mentor Intensive Program, lasts one to three months.&lt;ref name="History of WARM"/&gt;

In October 1986, WARM hosted a national conference at the Minneapolis Plaza Hotel called "The Contemporary Women in the Visual Arts". The conference featured speakers such as [[Wilhelmina Holladay]], artist [[June Wayne]], and Janet Wolff. WARM Gallery and other galleries in the Twin Cities featured women artists during the conference. WARM also sponsored a traveling exhibition featuring artist [[Harmony Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Crowe|editor1-first=Edith L.|title=WOMEN AND ART DOCUMENTATION GROUP: The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=Spring 1987|volume=6|issue=1|page=36|jstor=27947720|doi=10.1086/adx.6.1.27947720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conference, WARM found itself in significant debt.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=67}} Shortly after the opening of the nearby [[Target Center]] sports complex in October 1990, parking and traffic problems worsened and the gallery experienced a decline in visitors. Unable to keep up with rising rents, the board made a decision to close WARM Gallery in January 1991. They retained the non-profit and the Mentor Program, moving to an office on University Avenue in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] before relocating to the Women's Building on Rice Street.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=74–75}}

==Post-gallery era==
The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota continues to hold exhibitions for its members. In addition to its educational and professional programs, WARM maintains an online art registry of local and regional artists and publishes an e-newsletter.&lt;ref name="History of WARM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olsen|first1=Alis|title=About WARM: History of WARM|url=http://www.thewarm.org/about-warm/|publisher=Women's Art Resources of Minnesota|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARM changed its name to Women's Art Resources of Minnesota in 2010.&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The WARM Gallery provided an important exhibition space outside of mainstream venues for Minnesota women artists. It was a catalyst for economic renewal in the Warehouse District and played an important role in the development of [[arts in Minneapolis]]. WARM served as a key Midwestern node in the early [[feminist art movement in the United States]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=2}}

The University of Minnesota's [[Weisman Art Museum]] held an exhibition of work from 12 of WARM's long-term members in 2006. The exhibition was documented in Joanna Inglot's 2007 book ''WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota''. The book includes a history of WARM and entries for each of the 12 artists featured in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner-Huggett|first1=Joanna|title=Review: WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota by Joanna Inglot|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=64–66|jstor=20358154}}&lt;/ref&gt; On WARM's 40-year anniversary in 2013, exhibitions were held at both the University of Minnesota's [[Katherine E. Nash Gallery]] and Robbin Gallery.&lt;ref name="Abbe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbe|first=Mary|title=Women's work, and proud of it|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/187324971.html|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Historical Society]] holds records and media related to WARM in its collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holbert|first1=Sue E.|title=MHS Collections: Women's History Resources at the Minnesota Historical Society|journal=Minnesota History|date=Fall 1990|volume=52|issue=3|page=116|jstor=20179218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
