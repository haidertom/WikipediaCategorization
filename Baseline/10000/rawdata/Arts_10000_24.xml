'''Fashion in the period 1700–1750''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries is characterized by a widening silhouette for both men and women following the tall, narrow look of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|1680s and 90s]]. This era is defined as late Baroque/Rococo style. The new fashion trends introduced during this era had a greater impact on society, affecting not only royalty and aristocrats, but also middle and even lower classes. Clothing during this time can be characterized by soft pastels, light, airy, and asymmetrical designs, and playful styles. Wigs remained essential for men and women of substance, and were often white; natural hair was powdered to achieve the fashionable look.

Distinction was made in this period between ''full dress'' worn at court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress, which had all but disappeared by the end of the century.

Fashion designers became more recognizable during this period, as men and women were eager to be dressed in the latest trends and styles. Fashion magazines emerged during this era, originally aimed at intelligent readers, but quickly capturing the attention of lower classes with their colorful illustrations and up-to-date fashion news.

==Women's fashion==

===Gowns and dresses===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Antoine Watteau]] --&gt; 
[[Image:Phillips Tea Party.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A rigid, upright posture with a sharp "break" at the bust is characteristic of the stiffly boned stays of the 1730s. These English ladies wear formal mantuas for tea.]]
[[Image:Elisabeth Christine of Braunschweig Wolfenbuettel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Empress Elisabeth Christine in riding costume.]]
In the early decades of the new century, formal dress consisted of the stiff-bodiced [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]]. A closed (or "round") [[petticoat]], sometimes worn with an apron, replaced the open draped mantua skirt of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]].  This formal style then gave way to more relaxed fashions.  

The ''robe à la française'' or [[sack-back gown]] had a tight bodice with a low-cut square neckline, usually with large ribbon bows down the front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed with all manner of lace, ribbon, and flowers. With flowing pleats from the shoulders was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a ''sacque''. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, Rachel H., "Costume," pg. 105 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body by means of a tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called "Watteau pleats" from their appearance in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].

The less formal ''robe à l'anglaise'', [[Close-bodied gown]] or "nightgown" also had a pleated back, but the pleats were sewn down to fit the bodice to the body to the waist. It featured a snug bodice with a full skirt worn without panniers, usually cut a bit longer in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief was worn around the neckline.

Either gown could be closed in front (a "round gown") or open to reveal a matching or contrasting [[petticoat]].
Open-fronted bodices could be filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], and toward the end of the period a lace or linen kerchief called a ''fichu'' could be worn to fill in the low neckline.

Sleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, and caught up at the elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the [[shift (clothing)|shift]] ([[chemise]]) beneath. Sleeves became narrower as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called [[engageante]]s were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|1770s]].

Necklines on dresses became more open as time went on allowing for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of [[pearl]]s, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled neckband, a separate piece from the rest of the dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 .&lt;ref&gt;B. Payne, "Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette introduced the chemise à la reine, a loose white gown with a colorful silk sash around the waist. This was considered shocking for women at first, as no corset was worn and the natural figure was apparent. However, women seized upon this style, using it as a symbol of their increased liberation.

===Underwear===
The ''stays'' or [[corset]] of the early 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the shoulders back until the shoulder blades almost touched.  The resulting  silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.

Skirts were worn over small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]], called panniers, in the 1730s and early 1740s. Depending on the occasion, these panniers varied in size. Smaller hoops were worn in everyday settings and larger hoops for more formal occasions, which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the French court of [[Marie Antoinette]].

The shift ([[chemise]]) or smock had full sleeves early in the period and tight, elbow-length sleeves in the 1740s as the sleeves of the gown narrowed.

Some women wore drawers (underpants) in England. For instance, as early as 1676 inventory of Hillard Veren had "3 pair of women drawers". Although, they are not common in English or New England inventories during the 17th and 18th century. Clothing Through American History: The British Colonial Era, by Kathleen A. Staples, Madelyn C. Shaw page 245

Woolen waistcoats were worn over the corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting.

[[Handbag|Free-hanging pockets]] were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the gown or petticoat.

Loose gowns, sometimes with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift ([[chemise]]), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, and it was fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.

===Outerwear===
[[Riding habit]]s consisted of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching petticoat. Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.

When outdoors, ladies also wore elbow-length capes, often lined with fur for warmth.

===Fabrics and colors===

In the early years of this period, pastel silk hoods and light colors became fashionable at the French court for mature women, under the influence of [[Madame de Maintenon]]. Younger women also wore light or bright colors, but the preference was for solid-colored or floral silks with ornamentation.

Gradually, trim in the form of applied lace and fabric ''robings'' (strips of ruched, gathered or pleated fabric) replaced the plain style.  Ribbon bows, lacing, and rosettes became popular, as did boldly patterned fabrics. Silk gowns and [[stomacher]]s were often intricately embroidered in floral and botanical motifs, demonstrating great attention to detail and care for an accurate portrayal of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1914|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-8109-6317-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mid-century vogue for striped fabrics had the stripes running different directions on the trim and the body of the gown.

[[Chintz]], Indian cotton fabric with block-printed imaging on a white base, was wildly fashionable.  Bans against their importation to protect the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[wool]]en industries did nothing to reduce their desirability.  Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds.  Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen ([[linsey-woolsey]]) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of [[Calico (textile)|Indian calicoes]]. Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but they were unable to produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=Beverly|author2=Giorgie Reillo|title=East &amp; West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2008|volume=41|series=4|pages=887–916|doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear and accessories===
[[Image:18th century shoes mules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoes of 1742 (left) and 1731 (right).]]
The '''[[shoe]]''' of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]] with its curved heel, squarish toe, and tie over the instep gave way in the second decade of the 18th century to a shoe with a high, curved heel. Backless [[mule (footwear)|mules]] were worn indoors and out (but not on the street). Toes were now pointed.  This style of shoe would remain popular well into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|next]] period. Shoes at the time had many variations of decoration, some even included metal wrapped threads.&lt;ref name="The Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slippers|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/156126?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=shoes+1700&amp;img=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women, particularly in France, began wearing a '''boutonnière''', or a small bouquet of fresh flowers in a "bosom bottle." About four inches in length, these glass or tin bottles were small enough to discreetly tuck into the bosom or hair, but also just large enough to contain water to keep the flowers from wilting.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=R. Turner|title=The Mode in Costume|year=1958|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
An 18th-century toilette began with a heavy white foundation made from white lead, egg white, and a variety of other substances. This was overlaid with white powder (typically potato or rice powder), rouge, and deep red or cherry lip color.

Tiny pieces of fabric, known as patches, in the shapes of dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion is thought to have originated as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings. A patch near the mouth signified flirtatiousness; one on the right cheek denoted marriage; one on the left cheek announced engagement; one at the corner of the eye signified a mistress.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.vintageconnection.net/ModesInMakeup.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suits===
The male suit, also known as the habit à la française, made of three parts: the [[justaucorps]], a jacket, and [[breeches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Marybelle S.|title=Fashion in History: Western Dress, Prehistoric to Present|year=1979|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waistcoat was the most decorative piece, usually lavishly embroidered or displaying patterned fabrics. In the early 18th century the Breeches usually stopped at the knee, with white stockings worn underneath and heeled shoes, which usually had large square buckles.  Coats were worn closer to the body and were not as skirt-like as during the Baroque era.  They were also worn more open to showcase the elaborate waistcoats..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrde|first=Penelope|title=The Male Image Men's Fashion in Britain 1300-1970|year=1979|publisher=The Anchor Press Britain|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7134-0860X|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics for men were primarily silks, velvets, and brocades, with woolens used for the middle class and for sporting costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas A.|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear===

In the early 18th century, men's shoes continued to have a squared toe, but the heels were not as high. From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from the first half of the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|year=1987|publisher=Drama Book Publishers|location=New York|pages=62, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessories===

Upper class men often wore a cane as part of their outfits, suspending it by a loop from one of their [[waistcoat]] buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs. The cane was thus less functional and rather for the sake of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Nesfield|title=The Costume Book|year=1935|publisher=Robert M. McBride &amp; Company, New York|location=New York, NY|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Wigs in a variety of styles were worn for different occasions and by different age groups.

The large high parted wig of the 1690s remained popular from 1700 until around 1720.  During this time various colors were worn, but white was becoming more popular and the curls were getting tighter. The cadogan style of men’s hair developed and became popular during this period, with horizontal rolls of hair over the ears. Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' or tied back at the nape of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag were brought to the front and tied in a bow in a style called a "solitaire".

Wide-brimmed [[hat]]s with brims turned up on three sides into [[tricorne]]s were worn throughout the era. They were an essential element to the "domino", a stylish costume for masquerade balls, which became an increasingly popular mode of entertainment. The "domino" style consisted of a mask, a long cape, and a [[tricorne]] [[hat]], all usually constructed of dark colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribiero|first=Aileen|title=The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790|year=1984|publisher=Garland|location=New York, NY|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's fashion==
{{contradict|date=August 2014}}
Toddler boys and girls wore low-necked gowns.  ''[[Leading strings]]''—narrow straps of fabric attached to the gown at the shoulder—functioned as a sort of leash to keep the child from straying too far or falling as they learned to walk.

Children older than toddlers continued to wear clothing which was in many respects simply a smaller version of adult clothing.  Although it is often said that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth.  Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were.&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls did not wear jackets or bedgowns.  Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded.  During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.  Even if the size is not apparent, it is usually possible to tell a child's garment from an adult's.

1.A simple trimmed lace and cloth dress English/French cut. (1710)

2. Silk dress supported by panniers. Note that there is no central parting to the dress. The low cut neckline is also less ornamented than a contemporary women's would be. (1718)

3.A group scene of a girl and two boys. Boys were breeched at around 5-10. The girl wears a low neckline that was customary for young girls and boys. (1724)

4.An example of an older girl not far from adulthood. The neckline is still lower than a womans but is more ornamented than that of a child. (1727)

5. The girl sitting holding a fan is displaying her leading strings that her mother would have used to make sure she didn't fall when learning to walk. (1730)

6.A boy of around 10 who has been breeched and wears a Frock coat of a child's pattern. The cuffs and frills would have been less obvious on a grown man. (1738)

7. A middle class girl c1740. The simpler fabric and colours used in her dress show her not to be of noble birth but not in poverty either.Again the low neckline is typical of girls of that age.(1740)

8.A group portrait of children in fine clothes of the period. The boy has been newly breeched while the girls have the characteristic low neckline of children. (1745)

==Satirising fashion==
[[Joseph Addison]] in 1711 devoted an issue of ''[[The Spectator]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Spectator no. 119. 17 July 1711&lt;/ref&gt; to satirising fashion, by noting how the country fashions lagged behind those in [[London]].  "As I proceeded in my journey I observed the petticoat grew scantier and scantier, and about threescore miles from ''London'' was so very unfashionable, that a woman might walk in it without any manner of inconvenience" and so on.

{{French literature sidebar}}
The '''Société littéraire des Goncourt''' ('''Goncourt Literary Society'''), usually called the '''académie Goncourt''' ('''Goncourt Academy'''), is a French literary organization based in Paris. It was founded &lt;!-- in 1900 (citation?) --&gt; by the French writer and publisher [[Edmond de Goncourt]] (1822–1896).  He wanted to create a new way to encourage literature in France, and disagreed with the contemporary policies of the [[Académie française]].

==Formation and organization==
Wishing to honor his deceased brother [[Jules de Goncourt|Jules]] (1830–1870), Goncourt  bequeathed his estate to establish an organization to promote [[French literature|literature in France]]. He named his friend, the writer [[Alphonse Daudet]], along with [[Léon Hennique]], to oversee and administer his estate. The society was to consist of ten members, of whom eight were nominated in the will. Each of the members was to receive an annuity of 6,000 [[French franc|francs]], and a yearly prize of 5,000 francs was to be awarded to the author of some work of fiction. After some litigation, the academy was constituted in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Goncourt, De|volume=7|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, each December, a ten-member board of the Académie has awarded the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]'' for the best work of [[fiction]] of the year.

Membership is reserved to writers who have produced works in the French language, but it is not limited to citizens of France. In 1996, the [[Spain|Spanish]] novelist and scriptwriter [[Jorge Semprún]] was elected as the first foreigner to become a member of the academy.

In addition to the Prix Goncourt, which comes with a symbolic cheque of 10 euros, the Académie Goncourt awards honors for first novel and achievements in short story, poetry and biography genres.

The ten members of the academy are usually called ''les Dix'' (the Ten).  They meet the first Tuesday of each month, except in summer. Since 1914, they have convened in an oval room, the ''salon Goncourt'', on the second floor of the Restaurant Drouant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drouant.com/fr/lhistoire/0-5-1-1.html "Histoire"], Restaurant Drouant. Note: The restaurant Drouant was founded as a ''bar tabac'' by the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] Charles Drouant, who expanded it to a [[bistrot]]. It made its reputation from the fresh oysters delivered by Drouant's brother, who farmed them. Daudet was a regular, as were artists such as [[Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Camille Pissarro]].&lt;/ref&gt; place Gaillon, in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|heart of Paris]].  The [[cutlery]]  which they use while dining there constitutes the main physical continuity of the academy.  Each new member receives the fork and knife of the member whom he (or she) is replacing, and the member's name is engraved on the knife and the fork.

'''''Automat''''' is a [[1927 in art|1927]] painting by the [[Visual arts of the United States|American]] [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[painting|painter]] [[Edward Hopper]]. The painting was first displayed on Valentine’s Day 1927 at the opening of Hopper’s second solo show, at the Rehn Galleries in [[New York City]]. By April it had been sold for $1,200.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Troyen, ''Hopper in Gloucester,'' in Carol Troyen, Judith Barter, Janet Comey, [[Elliot Bostwick Davis]] and Ellen Roberts (eds.), ''Edward Hopper''. Boston: MFA Publications (Museum of Fine Arts), 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is today owned by the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa.

==The woman==
The painting portrays a lone woman staring into a cup of coffee in an [[automat]] at night. The reflection of identical rows of light fixtures stretches out through the night-blackened window.

Hopper's wife, [[Josephine Hopper|Jo]], served as the model for the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, (1995) 2007, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hopper altered her face to make her younger (Jo was 44 in 1927).  He also altered her figure; Jo was a curvy, full-figured woman, while one critic has described the woman in the painting as {{"'}}boyish' (that is, flat-chested)".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carol Troyen, ''{{'}}The Sacredness of Everyday Fact': Hopper’s Pictures of the City''. In Carol Troyen, Judith Barter, Janet Comey, [[Elliot Bostwick Davis]] and Ellen Roberts (eds.), ''Edward Hopper''. Boston: MFA Publications (Museum of Fine Arts), 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.

She has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time.

The time of year—late autumn or winter—is evident from the fact that the woman is warmly dressed. But the time of day is unclear, since days are short at this time of year.  It is possible, for example, that it is just after sunset, and early enough in the evening that the automat could be the spot at which she has arranged to rendezvous with a friend. Or it could be late at night, after the woman has completed a shift at work. Or again, it could be early in the morning, before sunrise, as a shift is about to start.

Whatever the hour, the restaurant appears to be largely empty and there are no signs of activity (or of any life at all) on the street outside. This adds to the sense of loneliness, and has caused the painting to be popularly associated with the concept of [[Urban sociology|urban alienation]]. One critic has observed that, in a pose typical of Hopper's melancholic subjects, "the woman's eyes are downcast and her thoughts turned inward."&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, Margaret, ''Edward Hopper''. [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], 2004, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic has described her as "gazing at her coffee cup as if it were the last thing in the world she could hold on to."&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland, ''Edward Hopper: Portraits of America''. Translated by John William Gabriel. Munich: Prestel, 1999, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine used ''Automat'' as the cover image for a story about stress and depression in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, August 28, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Ivo Kranzfelder compares the subject matter of this painting (a young woman nursing a drink alone in a restaurant) to [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Plum]]'' and [[Edgar Degas]]'s ''[[L'Absinthe]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Kranzfelder, ''Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 2010, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;—although unlike the subject in Degas's painting, the woman is introspective, rather than dissipated.

==The viewer’s perspective==
The presence of a chairback in the lower right-hand corner of the canvas suggests that the viewer is sitting at a nearby table, from which vantage-point a stranger might be able to glance, uninvited, upon the woman.

In an innovative twist, Hopper made the woman’s legs the brightest spot in the painting, thereby "turning her into an object of desire" and "making the viewer a voyeur."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hobbs, ''Edward Hopper''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; By today’s standards this description seems overstated, but in 1927 the public display of women’s legs was still a relatively novel phenomenon.

Hopper would make the crossed legs of a female subject the brightest spot on an otherwise dark canvas in a number of later paintings, including ''[[Compartment C, Car 293]]'' (1938)[http://artsandletters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/hopper-compartment-c-car-293-image-geoffrey-clements-corbis.jpg] and ''[[Hotel Lobby]]'' (1943).[http://ayiajavon.com/imd100/g2.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;The comparison between ''Automat'' and ''Hotel Lobby'' is made in Robert Hobbs, ''Edward Hopper.'' New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The female subject of his 1931 painting ''[[Barber Shop]]''[http://www.artsfairies.com/Edward_Hopper/Hopper_Edward_The_Barber_Shop.jpg] is also in a pose similar to the woman in ''Automat'', and the viewer's image of her is similarly bisected by a table. But the placing of the subject in a bright, populated place, at midday, makes the woman less isolated and vulnerable, and hence the viewer's gaze seems less intrusive.

==The restaurant==
As critic Carol Troyen notes, "the title, rather than any detail within the picture, is what identifies the restaurant as an automat."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Troyen continues on, however, to note a number of features which would have made the restaurant identifiable to a New Yorker of the 1920s: "They were clean, efficient, well-lit and—typically furnished with round Carrera marble tables and solid oak chairs like those shown here—genteel. By the time Hopper painted his picture, automats had begun to be promoted as safe and proper places for the working woman to dine alone."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; To a New Yorker of the 1920s, Hopper's interior would have been instantly recognizable as an Automat. A 1912 photograph of the Automat in [[Times Square]] reveals every detail of the chairs and the marble-topped tables to correspond with what Hopper has painted.&lt;ref&gt;See photograph in Lorraine B. Diehl and Marianne Hardart, ''The Automat: The History, Recipes, and Allure of Horn and Hardart's Masterpiece.'' New York: Clarkson Potter, 2002, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not the Times Square Automat; the ceiling lights at that location were significantly more ornate than the ones in the painting.

Automats, which were open at all hours of the day, were also “busy, noisy and anonymous. They served more than ten thousand customers a day."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Moreover, the woman is sitting in the least congenial spot in the entire restaurant for introspection. She has, as Troyen notes, the table nearest the door, and behind her, on her other side, is the staircase to the restaurant’s below-ground level. Even if the restaurant were relatively empty, there would have been constant foot-traffic past her table. Thus, "the figure’s quiet, contemplative air," which is "out of step with the city’s energy, its pace and its mechanized rhythm,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; is made even more noteworthy by the particularly busy spot in which she has chosen to sit.

==The window==
Hopper’s paintings are frequently built around a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] that unfolds as the viewer gazes into a window, or out through a window. Sometimes, as in ''[[Railroad Sunset]]'' (1929),[http://www.sai.msu.su/cjackson/hopper/hopper12.jpg] ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''[[Office in a Small City]]'' (1953), it is still possible to see details of the scene beyond even after Hopper has guided the viewer’s gaze through two panes of glass. When Hopper wishes to obscure the view, he tends to position the window at a sharp angle to the viewer’s vantage-point, or to block the view with curtains or blinds. Another favourite technique—used, for example, in ''[[Conference at Night]]'' (1949),[http://www.artsfairies.com/Edward_Hopper/Hopper_Edward_Conference_At_Night.jpg]—is to use bright light, flooding in from the exterior at a sharp angle from the sun or from an unseen streetlight, to illuminate a few mundane details within inches of the far side of the window, thereby throwing the deeper reaches of the view into shadow.

By way of comparison, in ''Automat'' the window dominates the painting, and yet "allows nothing of the street, or whatever else is outside, to be seen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mark Strand, ''Hopper''. New York: Knopf, 2007, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete blackness outside is a departure both from Hopper’s usual techniques, and from realism, since a New York street at night is full of light from cars and street lamps. This complete emptiness allows the reflections from the interior to stand out more dramatically, and intensifies the viewer’s focus upon the woman.

The window conveys an impressionistic view, rather than one that is realistic, in another way. As [[Mark Strand]] notes, "The window reflects only the twin receding rows of ceiling lights and nothing else of the automat interior." It is possible that Hopper omitted these reflections in order to avoid distractions that might turn the viewer’s away from the woman.  Strand, however, suggests an alternative reason why the woman’s reflection is omitted:

{{cquote|The painting suggests several things, but the most obvious and most resonant is that if what the window reflects is true then the scene takes place in limbo and the seated woman is an illusion. This is a troubling idea. And if the woman thinks of herself in this context, she cannot possibly be happy.  But of course she does not think, she is the product of another will, an illusion, an invention of Hopper’s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}
The focusing effect of the blank window behind the woman can be seen most clearly when it is contrasted with ''[[Sunlight in a Cafeteria]]'' (1958),[http://www.museumsyndicate.com/images/1/9792.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;The comparison between ''Automat'' and ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria'' is made in Ivo Kranzfelder, ''Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 2010, p. 146, and in Lloyd Goodrich, ''Edward Hopper''. New York: Abradale Press / Harry N. Abrams, 1983, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Hopper’s late paintings. In that painting, a female and a male subject sit in an otherwise empty cafeteria in spots reminiscent of the tables occupied, respectively, by the female subject and the viewer in ''Automat''. Even the bowl of fruit on the windowsill in ''Automat'' has its parallel in a small potted plant on the windowsill in ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria''. But in ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria'', the well-illuminated street scene outside the large window seemingly distracts the man's attention from his counterpart, so that the two subjects "do not seem to be acting in the same scene, as it were."&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gunter Renner, ''Edward Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in ''Automat'' the viewer is fully engaged by the presence of the woman.

'''Boho-chic''' is a style of [[fashion]] drawing on various [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[hippie]] influences, which, at its height in late 2005 was associated particularly with actress [[Sienna Miller]] and model [[Kate Moss]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and (as "boho" chic) actress and businesswoman [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] in the [[United States]]. It has been seen since the early 1990s and, although appearing to wane from time to time, has repeatedly re-surfaced in varying guises. Many elements of boho-chic became popular in the late 1960s and some date back much further, being associated, for example, with [[pre-Raphaelite]] women of the mid-to-late 19th century.

==Lexicography==
[[Image:Sherlock Holmes - Blue Carbuncle.JPG|thumb|left|Sherlock Holmes "upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown" in ''The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle'' (Illustration by Sidney Padget, ''Strand Magazine'', 1891)]]

==="Boho"===
"BoHo" is an abbreviation of Bohemian Homeless, self descriptive of the style.

Vanessa Nicholson (granddaughter of [[Vanessa Bell]], one of the pivotal figures of the unconventional, but influential "[[Bloomsbury Group]]" in the first half of the 20th century) has described it as a "curious slippery adjective".&lt;ref&gt;''Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original [[Bohemian|Bohemians]] were inhabitants of central [[Europe]], the term has, as Nicholson noted, "attached itself to individuals as disparate as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]]". The writer and historian [[A. N. Wilson]] remarked that, "in his dress-sense as in much else", [[Winston Churchill]] was "pre-[[First World War]] Bohemian", his unbleached [[linen]] suit causing surprise when he arrived in [[Canada]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson (2005) ''After the Victorians''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s first short story about Holmes for ''The Strand'', [[Doctor Watson]] noted that the detective "loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul" and "remained in our lodgings in Baker-street, buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition..".&lt;ref&gt;''A Scandal in Bohemia'', 1891&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Savannah Miller]], elder sister of actress Sienna Miller, described a "real bohemian" as "someone who has the ability to appreciate beauty on a deep level, is a profound romantic, doesn't know any limits, whose world is their own creation, rather than living in a box".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Chic"===
"[[Chic (style)|Chic]]" was borrowed from French in the late 19th century and has come to mean stylish or [[Elegance|elegant]].

==Elements==
[[Image:Boho 003.jpg|thumb|340px|left|Furry [[gilet]], Autumn 2005]]
The boho look, which owed much to the [[hippie]] styles that developed in the middle to late 1960s, became especially popular after [[Sienna Miller]]'s appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 26 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although some of its features were apparent from photographs of her taken in October 2003&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and of others living in or around the postal district of W10 ([[North Kensington]]), an area of [[London]] associated with bohemian culture since the mid-1950s.

By the spring of 2005, boho was almost ubiquitous in parts of London and was invading stores in almost every British high street.&lt;ref&gt;''Closer'', 10–16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents were sometimes referred to as "Siennas",&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; this eponym even being applied to Miller herself: "Sienna's Sienna-ishness", as Jessica Brinton put it in the ''Sunday Times'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 5 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Features included "floaty" skirts (notably long white ones), furry [[gilet]]s, embroidered tunics, cropped jackets, large faux-coin belts, sheepskin ([[UGG Australia|UGG]]) boots and [[cowboy boot]]s, baggy cardigans and "[[hobo bag]]s". Demand was so great that there were allegations the following year of some sub-contractors' having used cheap child labour in [[India]] for [[zari]] embroidery and [[beading]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Footless [[tights]] or "[[leggings]]", of which Miller was a proponent, were a contributory factor in the halving of sales of [[stockings]] in Britain between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 18 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho trends==
[[Image:SiennaMillerFactoryGirl.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Sienna Miller]] at the London premiere of ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'', 2007]]

===Sienna Miller in the early 2000s===
Sienna Miller's relationship with – and, for a time, [[engagement]] to – actor [[Jude Law]], after they had starred together in the 2004 film, ''[[Alfie (2004 film)|Alfie]]'', kept both her and her style of dress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey |first=Catriona |url=http://www.getlippy.com/starstyle/siennamiller/herstyle/ |title=Cosmopolitan, the women's magazine for fashion, beauty, sex tips and celebrity news |publisher=Getlippy.com |date=2015-10-13 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the media headlines during 2004–05. In December 2004, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' featured Miller on its front cover and described her as "the girl of the year".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Vogue'', December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ending of her relationship with Law (which resumed temporarily in 2009–10) seemed to signal that boho too was past its peak. In fact, as early as May 2005 the ''Sunday Times Style'' magazine had declared that "overexposed" white peasant skirts were "going down"&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 16 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and had advised adherents of boho to "update your boho [[mojo (African American culture)|mojo]]" by mixing the look with metallic items (anticipating so-called "[[boho-chic#Boho-rock and gothic|boho-rock]]" in 2006) or with layers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;''Style'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2005, Miller herself, who claimed later that her boho look was not very original – "I think I'd just come back from traveling or something"&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; – had adopted other styles of dress and her shorter, [[bob cut|bobbed hairstyle]] – ironically a feature of bohemian fashion in the quarter century before [[World War II]] – helped to define a new trend in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Hair'', June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She was quoted in ''Vogue'' as saying "no more boho chic ... I feel less hippie. I just don't want to wear anything floaty or coin-belty ever again. No more gilets ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Vogue'', January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, in 2008, Miller reflected that

{{quote|It was a strange social experiment, to be responsible for all that. It made me self-conscious, which, inherently, I'm not. People would say, "I'm sick of boho", and now I stand up and say, "But I liked those clothes – it's not my fault that they were copied, you wore them and now you're sick of them. Also, I did not start the trend."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;}}

===2007–08: folk, "diluted", and Balearic boho===
In the autumn of 2006, ''The Times''' style director Tina Gaudoin observed that "when the women's wear buyer at M[arks] &amp; S[pencer] is quoted saying 'boho is over', you know the trend is well and truly six foot under."&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the so-called "[[Folk art|folk]]" look of spring 2007, with its smock tops and flounce hemmed dresses, owed much to boho-chic, while embracing such trends as the re-emergence of the [[miniskirt|mini-dress]]: as the ''Sunday Times'' put it, "if you are still bemoaning the passing of the gypsy look, then the folk trend could be your saving grace".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 18 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times'' cited the 1960s singer [[Mary Hopkin]] as influencing the use of [[bandanna]]s,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; while, around the same time, Sienna Miller's appearance as 1960s "starlet" [[Edie Sedgwick]] in the film ''[[Factory Girl (film)|Factory Girl]]'' positioned her once more as a bohemian style icon. ''London Lite'' observed in May 2007 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You may baulk at the very word, but this summer's style has definite nuances of boho – albeit in a very diluted form. Sienna Miller's gipsy skirt brigade somehow didn't finish this feminine trend off for good, and some of the less contrived ingredients – embroidery, leather, gentle frills – are back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Mischa barton london.JPG|thumb|160px|right|[[Mischa Barton]] in 2006]]
Noting that "this time it's much more about a deconstructed, looser version of English Country Garden style", ''London Lite'' recalled the early 1970s designs of [[Laura Ashley]] – "all folds of floral cotton and centre partings".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Deborah Arthurs, ''London Lite'', 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses [[Mischa Barton]] and [[Milla Jovovich]] were cited as exponents of this look, while [[Jade Jagger]] (daughter of Sir [[Mick Jagger]], of the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Bianca Jagger]]) was said to be promoting her own style of "[[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] boho" on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Ibiza]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; a long-time haven for [[beatniks]] and hippies who colonised the village of [[Santa Eulària des Riu|Sant Carles]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Stewart, ''Ibiza &amp; Formentera'' (Rough Guide Directions, 2nd ed., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tatler'' wrote of Jagger – "the original 'Boho'" – that she "lives, breathes and creates a certain kind of contemporary "bohemian" chic", although Jagger herself claimed to be "a little wary of the word "bohemian"", describing her approach as "daring to mix ... combining things that are unexpected".&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Mitchell, ''The Tatler'', November 2010. The particular context of Jagger's observations was her styling of a group of villas in Marrakech.&lt;/ref&gt; Jagger modelled for designer [[Matthew Williamson]], whose style has been described as combining "Ibiza glamour" with "London cool".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Sienna Miller has written that, when she first met Williamson, whose [[muse]] she became,&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her mother's kitchen in 2001

&lt;blockquote&gt;she had a magazine on the table with Jade Jagger wearing the most beautiful bright dress I had ever seen. I remember thinking it was my dream dress. I now feel that way about almost every dress of Matthew's I have worn".&lt;ref&gt;Sienna Miller, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 "destination dressing" for Ibiza was still deemed to "embrace boho chic with a hint of understated glamour"&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Stewart, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in August 2007, Sienna and Savannah Miller launched their own fashion label, Twenty8Twelve (so-called after Sienna's birthday, 28 December), one commentator referred to Sienna's "own brand of [[Notting Hill]]billy chic" (a reference to London W10) and remarked that, "with [her] love of all things boho, it's unsurprising to see a thread of louche, folksy styling running through the line".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Deborah Arthurs in ''London Lite'', 3 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same writer observed wryly that "quite how many French peasants hoed fields in printed smocks is undocumented" and felt that one particular shirt-dress was "a little too reminiscent of [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]] in [[Oliver Twist]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The following year, the ''Sunday Times'', noting that one in two Americans and one in five Britons were reportedly sporting [[tattoo]]s, observed that Miller "complete[d] her luxe-layabout look with a cluster of stars on her silken shoulder";&lt;ref&gt;Alice Fordham in ''Sunday Times Style'', 13 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that she had also a tattoo of a bluebird, the subject of both a poem by [[Charles Bukowski]] and a drawing by Edie Sedgwick; and that Kate Moss displayed "two swallows diving into her buttock crack".

===Recession of 2008–10: ''broderie'', exotic lingerie, 70s glam/beatnik===
[[Image:Zooey Deschanel at Mercy Lounge in Nashville, TN by breezy421.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Zooey Deschanel]] in 2008]]
In 2008 fashion consultant [[Gok Wan]] cited a ''[[broderie anglaise]]'' top worn by [[Nadine Coyle]] of the group [[Girls Aloud]] as evidence that "the folk/boho look is so hot for summer",&lt;ref&gt;''Sky Mag'', June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while Marks &amp; Spencer employed the headline "Bohemian Rhapsody" to summarise its summer range, which owed much to the colours and patterns of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', May/June 2008. ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' was the title of 1975 hit record by the British rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of June that year fashion writer Carrie Gorman announced that "this week, shopping is about going bright and bold with a boho feel", citing, among other trends, multi-coloured [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]]s ("or dress, according to your height") by Harlow, said to be the favorite label of American actress [[Rachel Bilson]].&lt;ref&gt;''thelondonpaper'', 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Bilson has cited Kate Moss and actress [[Diane Keaton]] as among her stylistic influences;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremovies.co.uk/filmmaking.asp?ID=185 |title=Filmmaking Category |publisher=Future Movies |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; striped multi-colored panties with brodierie edging were a feature of her photographic shoot for ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' magazine in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/stuff/girls-of-stuff/37978/rachel-bilson.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502065805/http://www.maxim.com/stuff/girls-of-stuff/37978/rachel-bilson.html |date=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, rather distinctive, exponent of the "vintage" look was actress and singer [[Zooey Deschanel]], who, in June 2008, appeared on the front cover of the magazine ''[[BlackBook Magazine|BlackBook]]'' in a black lace-edged [[swimsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/zooey-deschanel-blackbook-june-july-cover-girl/3022 |title=Zooey Deschanel: BlackBook June–July Cover Girl - BlackBook |publisher=Blackbookmag.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a journalist wrote of Deschanel:

{{quote|... she's the antistarlet ... She tiptoes in looking like a graceful version of boho-chic 29-year-olds found everywhere from Brooklyn to Silver Lake, with an [[Barack Obama|Obama]] [Democratic Presidential candidate] button on her vintage coat and [t]he ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' rolled up in her pocket...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24967420/ns/entertainment-movies/ |title=Actress Zooey Deschanel is the antistarlet - Entertainment - Movies - TODAY.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deschanel's "kooky" style&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Radio Times'', 23 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently found a popular outlet as [[Los Angeles]] teacher Jess Day, whom she played in the [[Fox TV]] [[sitcom]], ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]'' (2011-). Jess's fashion preferences, including some striking brassières in a range of colours,&lt;ref&gt;Notably a purple demi [[rhinestone]] bra by [[Victoria's Secret]] in series 2, episode 15 ("Cooler")&lt;/ref&gt; attracted much interest, while, around the same time, Anastasia (Ana) Steel's tastes in [[E. L. James]]' best-selling erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' (2011) were thought to have assisted sales of exotic lingerie.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Jones in ''Daily Mail'', 15 August 2012; Rachel Felder in ''New York Times'', 13 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue was a favoured color ([[Natalie Portman]] as Dr. Emma Kurtzman was shown dressing hastily for work in a lacy blue bra in the 2011 film, ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]'') and was Ana's own preference: "I'm in the pale blue lacy perfect-fit bra. ''Thank heavens''".&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Shades of Grey'', chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the winning German entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|Eurovision Song Contest]] proclaimed, "I even did my hair for you/I bought new underwear, they're blue" (''[[Satellite (Lena Meyer-Landrut song)|Satellite]]'', sung by [[Lena Meyer-Landrut|Lena]]). In 2013 the former "little hippie"&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', ''You'', 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|X Factor]]'' contestant [[Diana Vickers]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Sun'', 7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; wore blue panties (with a short white top bearing the legend, "LOST MY MIND") for a widely publicised photoshoot for the magazine ''[[FHM]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 7 November 2013; ''FHM'', January 2014. In one photograph Vickers was holding a copy of [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|Motorcycle Diaries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although boho once again appeared to be on the wane by 2009, elements of it were clearly in evidence in collections for spring and summer 2010. [[Fashion Union]] advertised "spring's new bohemian trend in full bloom" and "hippie chic tops on loveworn denims",&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Union, ''The Fashionista's Pocket Guide to Miami'', Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Avon Products|Avon]] introduced a perfumed spray called "Boho Chic". [[Monsoon Stores Ltd|Monsoon]], founded in 1973 and still described by the ''Sunday Times'' in 2010 as "the boho chic fashion retailer", saw its pre-tax profits rise dramatically during the [[Late-2000s recession|recession]] of the late noughties: from £3.6 million in 2008 to £32.6 million in the year to August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Business'', 21 March 2010. In early 2010 Monsoon planned to open a further 140 stores worldwide in the coming year.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bohemian clothing.jpg|thumb|upright|Women wearing bohemian clothing]]
In 2010 the ''Sunday Times'' anticipated that the medieval [[Mail (armour)|head chain]] – "a step on from the hippie head band" – would be a feature of that year's festival circuit, "instantly adding summer bohemia to your look". Socialite [[Nicole Richie]]'s "beatnik/[[Glam rock|disco-glam]] mash-up" was cited as an example of this trend, while [[Peaches Geldof]], model and daughter of rock musician [[Bob Geldof]], was identified as another who had adopted the look.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year the ''Sunday Times'' lauded the "''haute'' hippie, bohemian splendour and punked up classics" that were putting "a modern spin on 1970s style". These included a cream [[crochet]] dress by [[Marc Jacobs]] ("''haute'' hippie") and a [[devoré]] dress and fringed [[scarf]] by [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]] ("boho splendour").&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Ewing, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late autumn of 2010 ''The Times'' noted the desirability in the UK of [[fake fur]] ("Recession chic lets Britain go full pelt for the fake fur"), with Marks and Spencer and [[J. Sainsbury|Sainsbury's]] TU retailing bestselling coats at a time of economic stringency. According to [[Lisa Armstrong]], "everyone from Kate Moss to [[Alexa Chung]], [[Fearne Cotton]] to [[Kylie Minogue|Kylie]] [Minogue], Rachel Bilson and [[Taylor Momsen]] to [[Carine Roitfeld]] ha[d] been swaddling themselves in exotic cat prints with varying degrees of success".&lt;ref name="The Times, 27 November 2010"&gt;''The Times'', 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong speculated also that the "[[Impossible Boot]]", based on a 1930s snow boot and so-called by its designer [[Penelope Chilvers]] because it had "proved a headache to make", might, despite its relatively high cost (£325–375), displace the Ugg,&lt;ref name="The Times, 27 November 2010"/&gt; which had been a durable boho accessory. As Armstrong put it wrily, the Impossible was "perfect for [[après-ski]]" in the fashionably bohemian London districts of [[Primrose Hill]] or [[Dalston]].

===Boho Chic Childrens' Fashion Trends===
Many parents have also embraced the Boho Chic trends and elements to create and purchase apparel for their children.  This particular trend is inspired by the casual American fashion of the 1960s, but as the counterculture included the influences of earlier time periods in its eclectic embrace of style and personal values, it often includes hints of the Victorian, a nod to the fabrics and details of the 1940s, or an homage to the intellectuals of the 1950's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrate Beautifully Styled Boho-chic Children’s Clothing Styles  (part 1)|url=http://www.magnolialakeclothing.com/posts/boho-chic-childrens-clothing/|website=Magnolia Lake Clothing|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and exponents==

=== Kate Moss and Sienna Miller ===
Many, including actress [[Lindsay Lohan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indiebohoboutique.com/collections/bohemian-attire-staff-picks |title=Kate Moss has a new A-list fan |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the boho look to supermodel [[Kate Moss]] (who in 1997 had been associated, through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]], with the so-called "[[heroin chic]]" or "[[waif]]" look). In fact the Australian journalist Laura Demasi used the term "boho-chic" as early as October 2002 with reference to Moss and Jade Jagger. In April 2004, the British-born fashion writer [[Plum Sykes]] was quoted as saying of a lynx mini-top, "Very cool, very bohemian, very Kate Moss–y";&lt;ref&gt;''New York Magazine'', 5 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 ''Times'' fashion editor Lisa Armstrong described a plaited leather belt of the previous year as a "Boho 'Kate' belt".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 20 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was the apparently unaffected ease with which Sienna Miller (dubbed by some as the "new Kate Moss"&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, London ''Evening Standard'', 5 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) carried off the look that brought it into the mainstream: even in advertisements for [[Chloé]] early in 2005 Miller was shown as if casually shopping, while she told ''Vogue'' that she had a laid-back approach to grooming, including cutting her own hair.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Established in 1993, the UK clothing label 'OVERIDER' described as 'the brand of a free spirit' and favoured for its understated, effortless, bohemian style exemplifies the 2014 Boho-chic trend.

In 2008 the ''Sunday Times'' applied the term "real chic" to a group of "the chicest celebrities", including Miller and actresses [[Julie Christie]] and [[Marion Cotillard]], who "handle the glare of fame with a large dose of reality", Miller being described as "a professional free spirit who, annoyingly, seems to have more fun than anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Brinton, ''Sunday Times Style'', 6 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Miller's appearance as the poet [[Dylan Thomas]]'s wife, [[Caitlin Macnamara]] in the film ''[[The Edge of Love]]'' caused one journalist to refer to "a new romantic style: woe-ho chic"&lt;ref&gt;Fleur Britten, ''Sunday Times Style'', 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This referred to the [[austerity]] clothing of the 1940s, worn also in the film by [[Keira Knightley]]:

{{quote|A beguillingly shambolic Sienna is seen sobbing on the beach busting a wartime make-do-and-mend look: boiled-wool cardie over flowery tea dress over folded-down wellies over long woolly socks.&lt;ref&gt;Britten, 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One reviewer observed of Miller's role that "Caitlin is meant to be a boho girl and free spirit, which is a posh way of saying she's a drunk who is promiscuous".&lt;ref&gt;Cosmo Landesman, ''Sunday Times Culture'', 22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal and impact ===
The cross-generational appeal of boho influenced, among other things, the ranges that brought about a revival in the fortunes of [[Marks and Spencer]] in 2005–06. An illustration of this, just as boho as such appeared to near its end, was M&amp;S's use of 1960s' icon [[Twiggy]] and younger models such as [[Laura Bailey (model)|Laura Bailey]] ("the natural choice for the season's bohemian chic"&lt;ref&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', Christmas 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) for a major advertising campaign in late 2005. In 2006 the ''Sunday Times'' identified fur gilets and "ugg-a-likes" as preferred winter wear for middle-aged women whom it described as the "[[Botulin toxin|botox]]-and-better-sex-after-40 brigade".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;''Style'', 18 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exemplars ===
In their differing ways, British singers [[Joss Stone]] (who, in 2011, named American singer [[Gwen Stefani]] as her style icon&lt;ref&gt;''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 24 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was by then combining an independent professional career with the lifestyle of a "[[Devon]] hippy"&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday Live'', 11 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) and (notwithstanding an early tendency to be associated with photographic spreads for "[[List of men's magazines|lads' magazines]]") [[Rachel Stevens]]&lt;ref&gt;In 2001 and 2002, Stevens was voted the second "sexiest woman in the World" by ''[[FHM]]'' readers in the UK.&lt;/ref&gt; were both held up in the mid-noughties as exemplars of boho. So, a few years later, were Diana Vickers and another teenaged singer, [[Pixie Lott]]. Following an event in 2009, the ''Daily Mail'' commented about Vickers that&lt;blockquote&gt;[she] looked like a cross between a stylish sixties icon and a rambler as she donned a stunning backless dress with a tramp's boots for an X Factor party last night. The 17-year-old, who spent much of her time on the ITV show running around barefoot, opted to cover up her feet with the charity shop footwear. The footwear drew attention away from the singer's stylish sixties style black and red dress which was split open at the back to reveal her [[brassiere|bra]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1164984/Nice-dress-Diana-shame-ugly-boots-X-Factor-stars-party-outfit-hit-miss.html |title=Nice dress Diana, shame about the ugly boots: X Factor star's party outfit is a hit and miss &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For her part, Pixie Lott cited French screen goddess [[Brigitte Bardot]] and Edie Sedgwick as her fashion icons – and ''Factory Girl'' as her favourite film – and defined her look as "vintage clothes, which I mix with contemporary stuff, or I'll be [[Indie design|indie]] and hippie, with accessories such as rings, chains and headbands ... I like to wear girlie things, but only if I can rock them up with biker boots or a jacket".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday, 3 October 2010"&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Author and critic Bruce Dessau wrote of American-British actress and singer [[Juliette Lewis]] that "there is something odd about [her] attractive boho-chic appearance in a stringy black vest, vintage beads and blue skirt that I cannot quite locate".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''London Lite'' contrasted the "gay glamour" of American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] with the "more relaxed, boho look" of her daughter, actress [[Kate Hudson]], noting that "keeping the colours neutral, [Hudson]'s careful not to break any style rules, with classy knitwear and good-quality accessories".&lt;ref&gt;Camilla St John, ''London Lite'', 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-judged exponent of boho, in the second series of ITV's ''[[Murder in Suburbia]]'' (2005), was Detective Sergeant Emma Scribbins, the character played by [[Lisa Faulkner]].

=== Fast fashion ===
The impact of boho illustrated certain broader trends in what Shane Watson referred to as "the way we dress now":&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;''Style'', 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that fashion was increasingly being dictated, not by the main houses, but what Watson called "the triple-F crowd" (the F referring to the f's in "famous and fashion-forward"), of which Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan and Sienna Miller were exemplars. Once they had spotted new fashions, young women were not prepared to wait a season for them to become available and, consequently, the familiar boundaries between summer wear and that for autumn and winter were becoming blurred. As [[Jane Shepherdson]], brand director of the clothing chain [[Topshop]], put it, "when Sienna wore that gilet, we had to pull them forward fast ... She was doing boho in the autumn, and we were expecting it to be a trend for the following spring. Girls see it and they want it immediately".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

The practice of meeting such demand, pioneered by the Spanish firm [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], and of which Shepherdson, until she left Topshop in 2006, was the leading British proponent,&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Collins ''(Draper's Magazine)'', ''Today'', BBC Radio 4, 6 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; became known as "[[fast fashion]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 30 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho-rock and gothic==

[[File:Theda-bara-cleopatra detail.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Theda Bara]] (1885–1955)]]
By Midsummer 2006, the ''Sunday Times'' had discerned a trend that fused aspects of boho-chic with "[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] attitude": "It's about wearing a studded leather jacket with a flimsy chiffon number, stomping about town in biker boots ... and wearing anything with a skull on it".&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Croft, ''Style'', 2 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper referred to this style, which had been a feature of collections for Autumn 2006 by [[Christian Dior]] and [[John Galliano]], as "boho-rock" and noted that both Sienna Miller and Kate Moss had adopted it. "[[gothic fashion|Gothic]] rock"&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Standard Magazine'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; had similar connotations. A look described by the ''Sunday Times'' in Autumn 2006 as "modern goth" was a more stylised version, exuding a "[[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] vibe" and contrasting "soft, light fabrics ... with the harsh sleekness of patent [leather]".&lt;ref&gt;Britt Bardo, ''Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The gothic look was in vogue again in the autumn of 2007, a sleeker "dark [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] style" being associated with, among others, Sienna Miller, twin actresses [[Mary-Kate Olsen|Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]] (through their clothing label, The Row), the Australian model [[Gemma Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;''thelondonpaper'', 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the rising Ukrainian singer [[Mika Newton]] (the latter notably in photographs associated with her début album of 2005, ''Anomaliya''). In 2009 [[Nicole Scherzinger]], lead vocalist of the [[Pussycat Dolls]], described her off-stage image as "understated-rock-boho-chic",&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Jane Gordon, ''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 5 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while, in the autumn of 2010, under the heading "Boho with bite", the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' advised readers after "dark, soft, floaty fabrics [to] flirt heavily with leather and lace, [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] and killer heels" and to "think laid-back cool with a shot of [[vampire|vamp]]".&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Baker in ''You'', ''Mail on Sunday'', 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In some respects this particular refinement harked back to the style of the [[silent film]] actress [[Theda Bara]], who became known as "the Vamp" (after "vampire") and habitually used kohl, a black cosmetic prevalent in Eastern countries, to make up her eyes.

====Florence Welch====
In 2009 the rise of British singer [[Florence Welch]] (as Florence + the Machine) coincided with the publication of [[Franny Moyle]]'s study of the private lives of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] Brotherhood of the mid-19th century (''[[Desperate Romantics]]'', 2009) and its dramatisation by BBC television. Welch has cited as her stylistic icons singer [[Marianne Faithfull]], who had been closely associated with the [[Rolling Stones]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;''Tatler'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and her former [[English language|English teacher]] who used to "come to school in crushed-[[velvet]] gowns like a medieval maiden&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 29 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, her stage image, which owed much to her long dyed [[red hair]],&lt;ref&gt;''Mail on Sunday'', 8 August 2010. Welch first dyed her hair red at the age of 10 and when she was 11 – during her "goth period" – wore it black: ''Mail on Sunday'', 1 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; called to mind the pre-Raphaelite [[muses]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Francesca Ryan, ''Daily Telegraph'', 4 June 2009; John Harris, ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; who, in certain respects, had anticipated the hippie styles of a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Maas, "The Pre-Raphaelites: A Personal View" in Leslie Parris (1984) ''The Pre-Raphaelite Papers''; Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination''. Welch denied in 2009 that she herself was a hippy – "I'm just an emotional creature": quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Welch herself once described her style as "[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|Lady of Shalott]] meets [[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]] [paintings by [[John William Waterhouse|Waterhouse]] and [[John Millais|Millais]]] mixed with scary gothic bat-lady"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jane Gordon in ''Mail on Sunday'', 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and declared her attraction to "doomed romantic heroines, like [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s [poem] ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Saturday Review'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of Welch's second album ''[[Ceremonials]]'' (2011) drew very clearly on later Pre-Raphaelite images.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf.'', for example, ''The Baleful Head'' by Edward Burne-Jones (1874), whose 2011 biographer has described him as "a perfect artist for that period [late 1960s] of flower power, sex, drugs and rock 'n'roll" (Fiona MacCarthy, ''op.cit.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on Welch's broader influence, one rock journalist noted in 2010 that "even [[Cheryl Cole]] [of Girls Aloud and an ''X Factor'' judge] has gone gothic princess on her ... single, "[[Promise This]]", and she's looking very Florence in the [[pop video|video]], all black [[leotard]]s and raggedy [[ballet tutu|tutu]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Nicholson in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karen Elson====
Other redheads whose personal style combined elegance with boho and gothic features were English model [[Lily Cole]] (who adopted black hair in 2010 – "Golly goth", as one newspaper headline put it&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 27 November 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;) and model/singer [[Karen Elson]]. Elson told a ''Times'' journalist that she had always been "the weird looking one" in modelling circles and remarked of herself and her then husband [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of the rock duo [[White Stripes]] that "there's going to be a point when our children view us as the [[Addams Family]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Playlist'', 8 May 2010. See also ''ES Magazine'', 14 May 2010: "Karen Elson and Jack White: The Addams Family of Rock".&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1960s incarnation of ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television, based on the characters created by [[Charles Addams]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1938, [[Carolyn Jones]] had created a gothic icon with her portrayal of [[Morticia Addams]].) Like Welch, Elson exuded pre-Raphaelite features, though a marked gothic strain was also apparent when, as a singer on stage in 2009, she wore a long salmon dress with black lace edging. Similarly, her [[lingerie]] portfolio that year for [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] combined gothic and boho-rock features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wasilak |first=Sarah |url=http://www.fabsugar.co.uk/Karen-Elson-Agent-Provocateur-2943683 |title=Karen Elson for Agent Provocateur &amp;#124; POPSUGAR Fashion UK |publisher=Fabsugar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; there being, for example, a certain resonance between a black and white brassiere and panties set that formed part of that collection and the black swimsuit in which Zooey Deschanel was photographed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''BlackBook'', June/July 2008 ''(supra)''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Pixie Lott said that the item of clothing she would save in a fire were her "favourite black frilly shorts".&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday, 3 October 2010"/&gt;

====Duchess of Cambridge====
[[File:William and Kate wedding.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|The Duchess of Cambridge]], in [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]] dress by [[Sarah Burton]], with [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] on their wedding day, 2011]]
In 2011 some detected a pre-Raphaelite line to the [[Alexander McQueen]] dress, designed by [[Sarah Burton]], for [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine Middleton]]'s [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|wedding]] to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Tim Adams in ''The Guardian'', 30 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Middleton's somewhat medieval headdress called to mind images from paintings by such later pre-Raphaelites as John Waterhouse and [[Edward Burne-Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;In her biography of Burne-Jones (''The Last Pre-Raphaelite'', 2011), Fiona MacCarthy referred to a "special kind of mysticism" in his major works. Citing this observation in a review, David Waller observed that "the girls are high born and ethereal, the men dreamy and knightly, the whole transfused with an idiosyncratic beauty": ''History Today'', October 2011, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt; the overall impression being especially apparent in a side-on double page photograph of the couple by [[Max Mumby]] on the cover of the following day's edition of the London ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 30 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boho terminology of 2004–10==
In advance of Glastonbury 2004, the ''Sunday Times'' coined the term "festival chic", for a style with some similarities to boho.&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 6 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently labelled a photographic spread of Sienna Miller, Lauren Bailey, [[Erin O'Connor]] and other muses of Matthew Williamson as "boho babes",&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 16 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; advised its readers to "think art-school chic" by adopting layers of clashing colours&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and, in 2006, noted that "last year's boho babe" had become "this year's boho-rock chick".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 2 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost an extension of "festival chic", the ''Telegraph'' coined the term "foho" to describe the evolution of the boho style in the summer of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Clare Coulson, '' The birth of Foho '', 16 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the newspaper, this look, which took its influence from both boho style and "the heavy influence of folk culture", had been seen on the likes of Sienna Miller and Kate Moss.

The London ''Evening Standard'' referred to "hippie chic" (a term used in the 1990s with reference to the velvet [[kaftan]]s created by [[Tom Ford]] for the Italian house of [[Gucci]]) in a feature about "gypsy queens",&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Standard Magazine, 11 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Sunday Times'', reflecting on what "the fashion world called ... boho chic", referred to Sienna Miller's having created "the retro hippie look that swept Britain's high streets".&lt;ref&gt;Dean Nelson, ''Sunday Times'', 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''London Lite'' hailed the return of "hippy, hippy chic"&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 14 May 2007. "Hippy, hippy chic" was a pun on ''[[Hippy Hippy Shake]]'', the title of a 1963 hit record by the [[The Swinging Blue Jeans|Swinging Blue Jeans]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as noted, Fashion Union marketed "hippie chic" tops in 2010.

"Boho-by-default" was an unflattering description used by Lisa Armstrong to describe the style of women ("gargoyles" as opposed to "summer goddesses") who, for summer wear, "drag the same greying, crumpled boho-by-default mess out of storage every year".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco and Talitha Getty ===
In 2006 the ''Sunday Times'' described the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] resort and seaport of [[Essaouira]] as the "boho/barefoot-chic beach" because of its association with fashionable "Euro aesthetes with their Talitha Getty-esque kaftans".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The latter was a reference to an iconic photograph of [[Talitha Getty|Talitha Pol]], wife of [[Paul Getty|John Paul Getty]], that was taken by [[Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield|Patrick Lichfield]] in [[Marrakesh]] in 1969. This image was described by Lisa Armstrong as "typif[ying] the luxe bohemian look".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating Glastonbury 2005, Hedley Freeman in the ''Guardian'' had recommended the wearing of headscarves to achieve "Talitha Getty chic".&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Freeman, Guardian, 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olsen twins and American bobo===
In the United States, [[Mary-Kate Olsen|Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]], especially the former, were credited with a "homeless" look, first identified as such in [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City|New York]] in late 2004, that had many "boho" features (large sunglasses, flowing skirts, boots and loose jumpers). This was sometimes referred to as "ashcan chic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The term, "bobo chic" (also known as "[[hobo]]-grunge",&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 7 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; "[[heroin chic]]" or "[[luxe grunge]]"), had similar connotations, "bobo" (or "BoBo") being a contraction of "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" and "bohemian" coined by ''New York Times'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] in his book, ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' (2000).

Bobo chic was associated in particular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] in the [[SoHo]] area of [[Lower Manhattan]], to the south of Greenwich Village. It was described by a student fashion writer as "paying to look poor" and having been "made popular by silver screen stars who all look like they got dressed in the dark like the Olsen twins, [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Chloë Sevigny]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kristale Ivezay, ''The South End'', 8 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 English actress [[Sophie Winkleman]], who had attended [[Cambridge University]] in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had "wor[n] floaty dresses at university ... thinking that I looked poetic and wistful. I actually looked homeless".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Times Body &amp; Soul'', 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another British commentator referred to Mary-Kate Olsen's "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dressing", but noted that, by 2006, the Olsens' merchandising empire was recording annual sales of £500 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Brinton, ''Style'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cocktail grunge and the catwalk====
A "[[catwalk]]", a refinement in 2006, of which actresses [[Kate Bosworth]] and [[Thandie Newton]] were said to be exponents, was referred to as "cocktail grunge" – "looking done-undone ... it's what Marianne Faithfull and [[Debbie Harry|Blondie]] would be wearing if they were young now".&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Paster, ''Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; – while a journalist who interviewed supermodel [[Helena Christensen]] in 2011 observed that, fresh from a photoshoot, she "flopped in a leather armchair like a sexy, ageing beatnik" and that, while "not a hippie, exactly", she lived in "[[groovy]] bohemia in Manhattan, where you can spot [her] moseying around the [[flea market]]s on the weekends".&lt;ref&gt;Giles Hattersley in ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2000s (decade), this combination of apparently conflicting features was adopted by teenaged actress [[Taylor Momsen]], who, in 2010, became the "face" of the British retailing chain [[New Look (clothing retailer)|New Look]]. Momsen described her style as "sweet and tough, [[grunge]] meets [[Chanel]] – a giant [[oxymoron]]" and claimed that she chose her outfits from "whatever clean clothes she finds on her floor" ("although no one ever believes me").&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French ''bobos'' and similar stylists ===
In the world of [[Paris]]ian fashion, the term ''bobo'' (short for ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bourgeois Bohème]]''), which also had political connotations, was applied to "typically discerning customers who are [[left wing]] and [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]";&lt;ref&gt;Carola Long in ''The Times Guide to Paris Fashion and Style'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or, put another way, "that subset of [[thirtysomething (term)|thirty- or forty-something]]-year-olds who don't allow their socialist leanings to interfere with an enjoyment of material pleasures".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;''National Geographic'', August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''la gauche caviar'' [the [[caviar]] left] was sometimes applied as an epithet to ''bobos''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 25 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''bobo'' style of dress has been described as "retro-hippie-[[shabby chic|shabby-chic]]",&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; its elements including [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] tops, [[boiled wool]] jackets, smart [[jeans]], [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] [[Athletic shoe|training shoes]] and leather bags by [[Jerome Dreyfuss]] (born 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Guide to Paris Fashion and Style'' October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A leading exponent was actress and singer [[Vanessa Paradis]], who particularly favoured the designs of [[Isabel Marant]] (born 1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modeaparis.com/va/couturiers/ima/index.html |title=Fédération Française de la Couture du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Créateurs de Mode |publisher=modeaparis.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while English actress [[Michelle Dockery]], best known for her part as Lady Mary Crawley in the early 20th century drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2010–14), cited Anglo-French actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as one of her style icons: "I love that she looks like she's just thrown it on. Simplicity is true elegance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Luxx'', 26 November 2011. Dockery added that, when wearing long dresses, she tried not to look "too ''Downton Abbey''" ... I like to make it a little bit more edgy".&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, another British actress [[Karen Gillan]], best known as [[Amy Pond]] in the BBC's science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', defined the look of 1960s model [[Jean Shrimpton]], whom she greatly admired and had just portrayed in a filmed drama for television, as "messy, [[gamine|waifish]], bony". She herself professed a liking for vintage clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When girls do the walk of shame ... I think they look best like that, slightly dishevelled." The Kate Moss look? "Yeah".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Magazine'', 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the teenaged rock bands, such as [[Second Sex (band)|Second Sex]]&lt;ref&gt;Second Sex took their name from the [[Second Sex|book]] of that name (1949) by [[Simone de Beauvoir]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Plastiscines]], that emerged in France ''c.'' 2006 and were known collectively as ''les bébés rockers'' ("baby rockers"), were initially derided in some sections of the press because of their ''bobo'' backgrounds: as Kate Spicer observed in the ''Sunday Times'', "it's as if a bunch of privileged [[Islington]] kids had picked up their guitars and proclaimed themselves the new [[Sex Pistols]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 25 March 2007. Islington is an upper-middle class area of London; the Sex Pistols were a leading [[punk rock|punk]] band of the late 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 ''bobos'' – "free-thinkers at the weekend, but bankers Monday to Friday" – were said to be squeezing out young, genuinely creative Parisians from their traditional neighborhoods,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Scofield, ''Sunday Times Travel'', 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Porte de Bagnolet (Paris Métro)|Porte de Bagnolet]], in the 20th ''[[arrondissement]]'', cited as an alternative base for "the next generation of diverse Parisian voices".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Spanish Gypsy Girls NGM-v31-p267.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish Gypsies, 1917 ''(National Geographic)'']]
The name "Bourgeois Boheme" was adopted in 2005 by a British company, founded by Alicia Lai, that marketed "ethnically sourced" fashion accessories and cosmetics and, by 2009, had moved into handmade shoes crafted from such materials as hemp and organic cotton.&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 21 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bohemian roots ==
{{main article|Bohemian style}}
Although boho-chic in the early years of the 21st century represented a definite style, it was not a "movement." Nor was it noticeably associated with bohemianism as such. Jessica Brinton saw it as "the tagging and selling of the bohemian dream to the masses for £5.99".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Sunday Times'' thought it ironic that "fashionable girls wore ruffly floral skirts in the hope of looking bohemian, nomadic, spirited and non-bourgeois", whereas "gypsy girls themselves ... are sexy and delightful precisely because they do not give a hoot for fashion".&lt;ref&gt;''Style'', 19 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the first half of the 20th century, aspects of bohemian fashion were a reflection of the lifestyle itself.

In fact, most of the components of boho had, in one way or another, drifted in and out of fashion since the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967 when [[hippie]]dom and [[psychedelia]] were at their peak. As journalist Bob Stanley put it, "the late 1960s are never entirely out of fashion, they just need a fresh angle to make them ''de jour''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

[[File:Byodoin Wall Painting JYOHIN-CHUSEI South.JPG|right|thumb|upright| Wall Painting on South door of Byōdō-in]]

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 218.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tōdai-ji restoration project lasted several generations, from roughly 1180 to 1212,&lt;ref name=munsterberg&gt;Munsterberg, Huge. ''The Arts of Japan: An Illustrated History''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

[[File:Sesshu - Haboku-Sansui.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Nihongo|''Splashed-ink Landscape''|破墨山水|''[[Haboku sansui]]''}}, [[Sesshū]], 1495, ink on silk, 148.6 × 32.7 cm]]

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

[[File:Hyônen zu by Josetsu.jpg|thumb|170px|Hyōnen-zu (瓢鮎図), ink on paper, 111.5 × 75.8 cm, Myōshin-ji temple, Taizō-in, Kyoto.]]

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

==[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603)==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - left hand screen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku".

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

{{see also|Seal of Alabama}}

The '''coat of arms of Alabama''' depicts a shield upon which is carried the symbols of the five nations which have at various times held sovereignty over a part or the whole of what is now [[Alabama]]. These are the coat of arms of [[France]], the ancient coat of arms of [[Crown of Castile]] for [[Spain]] ([[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] quartering [[Kingdom of León|León]]), the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (which was not adopted until after Alabama's independence) and the battle flag of the [[Confederate States of America]]. On an escutcheon of pretence is borne the shield of the [[United States]]. The crest of the coat represents a ship (the "Badine") which brought the French colonists who established the first permanent European settlements in the state. Below is the [[List of U.S. state mottos|state motto]]: ''[[Audemus jura nostra defendere]]'', meaning "We dare defend our rights."

The bill to adopt a state coat of arms was introduced in the Alabama Legislature of 1939 by James Simpson, Jefferson County, and was passed without a dissenting vote by both houses.&lt;ref name="ADAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us |title=Alabama Department of Archives and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original design of the Alabamian coat of arms was made in 1923 by B.J. Tieman, New York, an authority on heraldry, at the request of Marie Bankhead Owen, Director of the Department of Archives and History.  A few years later Naomi Rabb Winston, Washington, DC, painted the completed design in oil.  Mrs. Owen selected the motto which was put into Latin by Professor W.B. Saffold, of the University of Alabama.  It was through the influence of Juliet Perry Dixon, wife of Governor Dixon, that official action was taken by the Legislature.&lt;ref name="ADAH"/&gt;

[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|left|British flag that would have flown in Alabama prior to American independence]]
The Union Flag depicted on the coat of arms, which represents the period of British rule in Alabama prior to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], is not actually the flag used at that time. It dates to the 1801 formation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], whereas the preceding [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] held sovereignty over Alabama prior to 1783.

==Use==
Besides being used by itself, the coat of arms is used on many governmental seals of the state, as well as the flag of the governor of Alabama.

In [[distributed computing]], '''code mobility''' is the ability for running [[Computer program|program]]s, code or objects to be [[data migration|migrated]] (or moved) from one machine or application to another.&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt; This is the process of moving '''mobile code''' across the nodes of a [[Computer network|network]] as opposed to distributed computation where the ''data'' is moved.

It is common practice in distributed systems to require the movement of code or processes between parts of the system, instead of data.&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuggetta|first=Alfonso|author2=Gian Pietro Picco |author3=Giovanni Vigna |year=1998|title=Understanding Code Mobility|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|publisher=IEEE Press  Piscataway|location=NJ, USA|volume=24|issue=5|pages=342–361|issn=0098-5589|url=http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/trans/ts/1998/05/e0342abs.htm|accessdate=29 July 2009|doi=10.1109/32.685258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of code mobility include scripts downloaded over a network (for example [[JavaScript]], [[VBScript]]), [[Java applet]]s, [[ActiveX control]]s, [[Flash animation]]s, Shockwave movies (and Xtras), and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] embedded within [[Microsoft Office]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~lpb/papers/mcode96.html | title=Mobile Code Security | publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy | accessdate=23 April 2012 | author=Dr Lawrie Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The purpose of code mobility is to support sophisticated operations. For example, an application can send an object to another machine, and the object can resume executing inside the application on the remote machine with the same state as it had in the originating application.

According to a classification proposed by Fuggetta, Picco and Vigna,&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt; code mobility can be either strong or weak:
''strong code mobility'' involves moving both the [[Machine code|code]], data and the execution state from one host to another, notably via a [[process image]] (this is important in cases where the running application needs to maintain its state as it migrates from host to host), while ''weak code mobility'' involves moving the code and the data only. Therefore, it may be necessary to restart the execution of the program at the destination host.

Several paradigms, or ''architectural styles'', exist within code mobility:&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt;

* [[Remote evaluation]] — A client sends code to a remote machine for execution.
* [[Code on demand]] — A client downloads code from a remote machine to execute locally.
* [[Mobile agent]]s — Objects or code with the ability to migrate between machines autonomously.

==Implementations==
Within code mobility, the Mobile Agent paradigm has conventionally attracted the most interest and research,&lt;ref name="Is Code Still Moving Around"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Carzaniga|first=Antonio|author2=Gian Pietro Picco |author3=Giovanni Vigna |year=2007|title=Is Code Still Moving Around? Looking Back at a Decade of Code Mobility|journal=ICSE COMPANION '07 Companion to the proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|location=Washington, DC, USA|pages=9–20|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248922|doi=10.1109/ICSECOMPANION.2007.44}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some recent work has produced general purpose implementations.&lt;ref name=Mobility-RPC/&gt;

;Mobile agent frameworks

Mobile code can also be encapsulated or embedded in other file formats not traditionally associated with executable code.  An example of this form of encapsulation is the presence of [[JavaScript]] in a [[PDF]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viruses==
Mobile code can also download and execute in the client workstation via email.  Mobile code may download via an email attachment (e.g., macro in a Word file) or via an HTML email body (e.g., JavaScript).  For example, the [[ILOVEYOU]], TRUELOVE, and AnnaK email viruses/worms all were implemented as mobile code (VBScript in a .vbs email attachment that executed in Windows Scripting Host). In almost all situations, the user is not aware that mobile code is downloading and executing in their workstation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Renting code==
Mobile code also refers to code "used for rent", a way of making software packages more affordable.  i.e. to use on demand.  This is specially relevant to the mobile devices being developed which are cellular phones, PDAs, etc. all in one.  Instead of installing software packages, they can be "leased" and paid for on a per-usage basis.

[[File:Court Theatre - the shed.JPG|thumb|The current premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]]]]
The '''Court Theatre''' is a professional theatre company based in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. It was founded in 1971 and located in the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] from 1976 until the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. It opened new premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]] in December 2011.  It is currently New Zealand's largest theatre company and is led by CEO, [[Philip Aldridge]] and artistic director Ross Gumbley.

== History ==

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Canterbury Provincial Council Stone Chamber.jpg|thumb|Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council]]]]
The company was founded by Yvette Bromley {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSM}} and [[Mervyn Thompson]] in 1971 who served as Co-artistic Directors for the first three years of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1,9,html/About-Us | title=Christchurch's Theatre | publisher=Court Theatre | location=Christchurch | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101856/http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1%2C9%2Chtml/About-Us | archive-date=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromley chose the theatre's name out of affection for the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]], which she knew well from her upbringing and drama education.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

During the first eighteen months of its existence, The Court had three venues. The first was ''The Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers]]'' (April – May 1971), where The Court's début production, ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' was staged.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crean |first1=Mike |title=Reliving Court's ties to landmark |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5833594/Reliving-Courts-ties-to-landmark |accessdate=15 August 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=22 October 2011 |page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the [[Māori Land Court]] would require the use of the chamber, necessitating the set being struck and taken to the Durham Street Art Gallery; the furniture being moved back into the chamber and the processed reversed for the next evening's performance. The Stone Chamber was one of the city's most magnificent structures, but it was impractical for a theatre company, as there was little room for an audience and a lack of toilets.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

Next was the ''Durham Street Art Gallery'' (June 1971 – May 1972), which was used as an interim venue between the Canterbury Society of Arts vacating the premises and the Law Court expanding into the area.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt; From June to August 1972, The Court was housed in the ''Beggs Theatrette'' and staged two productions in the space.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The next four years (September 1972 – February 1976) were a period of relative stability. The Court Theatre was housed at The Orange Hall on Worcester Street. In 1974, Mervyn Thompson stood down leaving Yvette Bromley as sole Artistic Director until 1975 when Randall Wackrow (who had joined the company as Business Manager in 1973) joined her as Co-artistic Director.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===The Arts Centre===
[[File:Court Theatre, Christchurch (Arts Centre).jpg|thumb|The Court Theatre at the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]]]]
In 1976, the company moved to the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] complex, in the buildings which were formerly the Engineering School of [[Canterbury College, Christchurch|Canterbury College]]. The performance space was previously lecture room D.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

From 1977 to 1978, Randall Wackrow served as sole Artistic Director, standing down in 1979 with the appointment of Elric Hooper.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper served as Artistic Director for more than two decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper declared his intent to balance the theatre's repertoire with "three main thrusts — the classic, the contemporary and the indigenous".  Although economic pressure saw a fledgling second auditorium, ''Court Two'', closed as a regular venue following the economic slump of the mid-eighties (although it was to be later revived as ''The Forge''), overall this philosophy was rewarded.

As the new millennium approached, The Court saw growth across the board — in audiences, income and acclaim, and expanded its company with the introduction of [[Theatresports]] to [[Australasia]] in the late 1980s and the formation of professional improvisation troupe, [[Court Jesters|The Court Jesters]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1990, Hooper was awarded the [[MBE]] and the 1990 Commemoration medal by the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper retired as Artistic Director in 1999 and Catherine Downes served as Artistic Director of The Court Theatre from 2000–2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ross Gumbley has been The Court's Artistic Director from 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Arts Centre premises ==
The Court operated two auditoria at the Arts Centre. Court One seated 291 in a broad 'semi-thrust' stage, staging at least eight productions each season totalling approximately 270 performances annually. Each season contained a mix of New Zealand works, modern international theatre and classics.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Forge (formerly known as Court Two) seated 123 in a 'box' setting with the audience seated on two sides. Until recently it was used as a hosting venue by touring or independent productions, but since 2007 The Forge was used by the Court for staging challenging international, local and devised works, with an aim of attracting a different audience demographic from its Court One patronage.

== Current role and activities ==
The Court Theatre employs professionals from around the country and internationally. It sustains a full-time professional staff and an ensemble acting company and is administered by The Court Theatre Trust. At any one time there can be up to 100 people working full-time at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In addition to being a full-time professional theatre company, The Court Theatre operates numerous other activities in the community. The company annually tours a show regionally around the [[South Island]]. Its education programme provides training for school-age students and adults, regularly liaising with high school and tertiary institutions as well as other community groups. The company also produces school holiday kids' shows and an annual touring primary school show.

Furthermore, the company employs a troupe of professional improvisors and corporate entertainers, The [[Court Jesters]]. The most public face of their work is the [[improv comedy]] show "Scared Scriptless" which is staged every Friday and Saturday night at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Creative peacebuilding''' is the larger name for artist approaches to [[peacebuilding]] within individuals, groups, and societies. It includes various forms of [[art therapy]], whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of [[violence]], as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.

== War and conflict ==
According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/|title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.&lt;ref name="Lederach2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL8VDAAAQBAJ|title=The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace|last=Lederach|first=John Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-974758-0|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLGcNb1_H1YC|title=Promoting Peace, Inciting Violence: The Role of Religion and Media|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-55746-7|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishaq|first=Ashfaq|date=December 2006|title=Development of children’s creativity to foster peace|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69915-7/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=368|pages=26–27|via=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art therapy==
Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate [[child soldiers]] in [[Uganda]] as well as to help children who lost their homes in the [[tsunami]] of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prutzman|first=Priscilla|date=October 1981|title=Children's Creative Response to Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x|journal=Peace and Change|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77–79|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Music therapy]] can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their [[stress (biology)|stress]] levels and express their feelings.&lt;ref name="Sutton2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3jtH_qeIIC|title=Music, Music Therapy and Trauma: International Perspectives|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84310-027-0|editor-last=Sutton|editor-first=Julie P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts ===
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avrahami|first=Dalia|date=2006|title=Visual Art Therapy's Unique Contribution in the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J229v06n04_02|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=6|issue=4|pages=5–38|doi=10.1300/j229v06n04_02|issn=1529-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visualization and technology ===
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially [[virtual reality]] simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq war]] who are suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental [[Creative visualization|visualization]], in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/world/iraq/2007-06-18-iraq-virtual-reality_n.htm|title=Iraq vets use virtual reality to ease post-battle trauma|last=Jones|first=Brent|date=18 June 2007|website=www.usatoday.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Create Peace Project===
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createpeaceproject.org|title=Create Peace Project|last=Holzman|first=Ross|date=8 May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barefoot artists===
Artist [[Lily Yeh]] has helped to heal the wounds [[genocide]] left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barefootartists.org/|title=Barefoot Artists|last=Yeh|first=Lily|date=|website=Barefoot Artists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River City Drum Corps===
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, Ky]] provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivercitydrumcorpky.com/rcdc/|title=About RCDC|last=|first=|date=|website=River City Drum Corp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the practice of [[religion]], a '''cult image''' is a [[Cultural artifact|human-made object]] that is [[venerated]] or [[worshipped]] for the [[deity]], [[spirit]] or [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] that it embodies or represents. ''Cultus'', the outward rituals and religious formulas of "[[cult (religion)|cult]]" (meaning religious practice, as opposed to the pejorative term for a potentially dangerous "[[New religious movement|new religion]]"), often centers upon the treatment of cult images.  In several traditions, including the ancient religions of Egypt, Greece and Rome, and modern Hinduism, cult images in a temple may undergo a daily routine of being washed, dressed, and having food left for them.  Processions outside the temple on special [[feast day]]s are often a feature. [[Religious image]]s cover a wider range of all types of images made with a religious purpose, subject, or connection.  In many contexts "cult image" specifically means the most important image in a temple, kept in an inner space, as opposed to what may be many other images decorating the temple.  

The term '''idol''' is often synonymous with ''cult image'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=idol "Idol" in the American Heritage Dictionary (2016.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idol "Idol" in Merriam–Webster (2017).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/idol "Idol" in the Oxford Living Dictionaries (2017).]&lt;/ref&gt; but may be used especially{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} of a cult image believed not just to depict or represent a deity or spirit, but in some sense to be one itself. Sometimes the image is believed to have its own powers, to grant wishes or otherwise affect the world. In cultures where idolatry is not viewed negatively, the word ''idol'' is not generally seen as pejorative, such as in [[Indian English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibletexts.com/glossary/idolatry.htm "Idol", ''Harper’s Bible Dictionary'', ed. Paul J. Achtemier], San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1985; but readily used by, for example, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5VZtNRl24fsC&amp;pg=PA66 Swami Tejomayananada, in his ''Hindu culture, An Introduction''], p. 66, Chinmaya Mission, {{ISBN|8175971657}}, 9788175971653&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cult of images''' is the practice of worshipping or venerating religious or cult images representing divine figures.  Common in a number of ancient religions, the practice continues most prominently today in [[Hinduism]].  The [[Abrahamic religions]] all specifically ban idols and [[idolatry]]; all have had internal divisions and disputes as to what constitutes the proper or improper use of images in religion, and many Abrahamic religious denominations use or venerate images with varying attitudes towards them.

In general the belief that an image itself is the object of worship, and itself has or embodies a spirit with inherent powers, tends to be hard to verify when a religious context is examined closely, or to be held at a popular level but denied by the clergy of a religion.  Assertions by others outside the religious group concerned that such beliefs are held by the group are however common.

==Ancient Near East and Egypt==
The use of images in the [[Ancient Near East]] seems typically to have been similar to that of the [[ancient Egyptian religion]], about which we are the best-informed. Temples housed a cult image, and there were large numbers of other images.  The [[Origins of Judaism|ancient Hebrew religion]] was or became an exception, rejecting cult images despite developing [[monotheism]]; the connection between this and the [[Atenism]] that [[Akhenaten]] tried to impose on Egypt has been much discussed. In the [[art of Amarna]] [[Aten]] is represented only as the sun-disk, with rays emanating from it, sometimes ending in hands.

Cult images were a common presence in ancient Egypt, and still are in modern-day [[Kemetism]].  The term is often confined to the relatively small images, typically in gold, that lived in the ''[[Shrine|naos]]'' in the inner sanctuary of [[Egyptian temple]]s dedicated to that god (except when taken on ceremonial outings, say to visit their spouse).  These images usually showed the god in their sacred [[barque]] or boat; none of them survive.  Only the priests were allowed access to the inner sanctuary.

There was also a huge range of smaller images, many kept in the homes of ordinary people.  The very large stone images around the exteriors of temples were usually representations of the [[pharaoh]] as himself or "as" a deity, and many other images gave deities the features of the current royal family.

==Classical Greece and Rome==
All [[ancient Greek temple]]s and [[Roman temple]]s normally contained a cult image in the [[cella]].  Access to the cella varied, but apart from the priests, at the least some of the general worshippers could access the cella some of the time, though sacrifices to the deity were normally made on altars outside in the temple precinct ([[tenemos]] in Greek).  Some cult images were easy to see, and were what we would call major tourist attractions.  The image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size, in marble or bronze, or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|Chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult imges were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine stutues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated.  

The [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity.  Many of the Greek statues well-known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] (2.35 metres high, including a helmet).

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], a "[[Palladium (mythology)|palladium]]" was an image of great antiquity on which the safety of a city was said to depend, especially the wooden one that [[Odysseus]] and [[Diomedes]] stole from the [[citadel]] of [[Troy]] and which was later taken to [[Rome]] by [[Aeneas]]. (The Roman story was related in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and other works.)

==Hinduism==
[[File:Dagdushet Halwai Ganpati 2005.jpg|thumb|A clay [[Ganesha]] murti, worshipped during [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] festival, and then ritually destroyed.]]
{{Main|Murti}}
The [[garbhagriha]] or inner shrine of a [[Hindu temple]] contains a cult image of the deity.  This may take the form of an elaborate statue, but a symbolic [[lingam]] is also very common, and sometimes a [[yoni]] or other symbolic form.  Normally only the priests are allowed to enter the chamber, but [[Hindu temple architecture]] typically allows the image to be seen by worshippers in the [[mandapa]] connected to it (entry to this, and the whole temple, may also be restricted in various ways).  

[[Hinduism]] allows for many forms of worship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vaswani| first = J.P. | title = Hinduism: What You Would Like to Know About| publisher = Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd| year = 2002| page = 12| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NVJORFklvLEC&amp;pg=PA12|quote = Hinduism also teaches us that all forms of worship are acceptable to God.

In [[Hinduism]], a ''murti''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pratima (Hinduism)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/398379/pratima|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically refers to an image that expresses a Divine Spirit (''murta''). Meaning literally "embodiment", a murti is a representation of a divinity, made usually of stone, wood, or metal, which serves as a means through which a divinity may be worshiped.&lt;ref name=kkk&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier|Klostermaier, Klaus K.]] ''A Survey of Hinduism''. 1989 pp. 293–5&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus consider a murti worthy of serving as a focus of divine worship only after the divine is invoked in it for the purpose of offering worship.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar Singh, Nagendra. ''Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Volume 7''. 1997, pp. 739–43&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the divinity must reflect the gestures and proportions outlined in religious tradition.

==Opposition from Abrahamic religions==
{{main|aniconism|iconoclasm}}
Members of [[Abrahamic religions]] identify cult images as "idols" and their worship as "[[idolatry]]", the worship of hollow forms. The [[paradox]] inherent in the worship of cult images was given classic expression in the [[Book of Isaiah]]:
{{quote |Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.|{{bibleref |Isaiah|2.8}}, reflected in {{bibleref |Isaiah|17.8}}.}}

The avoidance of such a degrading paradox was expressed in the early Christian idea of miraculous [[icon]]s that were not made by human hands, ''[[Acheiropoieta|acheiropoietoi]]''. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians make an exception for the [[veneration]] of image of saints, which is not considered by them to be [[adoration]] or ''[[latria]]''. The word ''idol'' entered [[Middle English]] in the 13th century from Old French ''idole'' adapted in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] from the Greek ''eidolon'' ("appearance" extended in later usage to "mental image, apparition, phantom").  Greek ''eidos'' was employed by [[Plato]] and the [[Platonists]] to signify perfect immutable "forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=i&amp;p=0 | title = Etymonline}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mecca==
Towards the end of the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic era]] in the Arabian city of [[Mecca]]; an era otherwise known, by the Muslims, as جاهلية, or [[Jahiliyyah|al-Jahiliyah]], the [[Paganism|pagan]] or pre-Islamic, merchants of Mecca controlled the sacred [[Kaaba]], thereby regulating control over it, and, in turn, over the city itself. The local tribes, of the [[Arabian peninsula]], came to this centre of commerce to place their idols in the Kaaba, in the process being charged [[tithes]]. Thus helping the Meccan merchants to incur substantial wealth, as well as insuring a fruitful atmosphere for trade and intertribal relations in relative peace.

The number and nature of deities in the pre-Islamic mythology are parallel to that of other polytheistic cultures. Some have been [[Arabian mythology|official Gods]] others of a more private character.

Muhammad's preaching incurred the wrath of the pagan merchants, causing them to plot against him. The opposition to his teachings grew so volatile that Muhammad and his followers were forced to [[Hijra (Islam)|flee Mecca]] to [[Medina]] for protection; leading to armed conflict and triggering many battles that were won and lost, which finally culminated in the [[conquest of Mecca]] in the year 630. In the aftermath, Muhammad did three things. Firstly, with his companions he visited the Kaaba and literally threw out the idols and destroyed them, thus removing the signs of [[Jahiliyyah]] from the Kaaba. Secondly, he ordered the construction of a [[mosque]] around the Kaaba, the first [[Masjid al-Haram]] after the birth of [[Islam]]. Thirdly, in a magnanimous manner, Muhammad pardoned all those who had taken up arms against him. With the destruction of the idols and the construction of the Masjid al-Haram, a new era was ushered in; facilitating [[Spread of Islam|the rise of Islam]].

==Christianity==
{{main|Religious images in Christian theology|Byzantine iconoclasm|Protestant Reformation and art}}
[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|right|Frans Hogenberg, ''The Calvinist Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566'', in [[Antwerp]], the key moment of the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566, when paintings and church decorations and fittings were destroyed in several weeks of a violent iconoclastic outbreak in the [[Low Countries]]. Several similar episodes occurred during the early [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] period.]]
Christian images that are venerated are called [[icon]]s. Christians who venerate icons make an emphatic distinction between "[[veneration]]" and "[[worship]]".

The introduction of venerable images in Christianity was highly controversial for centuries, and in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the controversy lingered until it re-erupted in the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. Religious [[monumental sculpture]] remained foreign to Orthodoxy.  In the West, resistance to idolatry delayed the introduction of sculpted images for centuries until the time of [[Charlemagne]], whose placing of a life-size [[crucifix]] in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a decisive moment, leading to the widespread use of monumental [[relief]]s on churches, and later large statues. 

The ''[[Libri Carolini]]'', a somewhat mis-fired Carolingian counter-blast against imagined Orthodox positions, set out what remains the Catholic position on the veneration of images, giving them a similar but slightly less significant place than in Eastern Orthodoxy. 

The intensified [[pathos]] that informs the poem ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' takes corporeal form in the realism and sympathy-inducing sense of pain in the typical Western European corpus (the representation of Jesus' crucified body) from the mid-13th century onwards. "The theme of Christ's suffering on the cross was so important in Gothic art that the mid-thirteenth-century statute of the corporations of Paris provided for a guild dedicated to the carving of such images, including ones in ivory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/euwf/hod_1978.521.3.htm | title = Metmuseum}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] engendered spates of venerable image smashing, especially in England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, the [[Low Countries]] (the [[Beeldenstorm]]) and France.  Destruction of three-dimensional images was normally near-total, especially images of the [[Virgin Mary]] and saints, and the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]]s ("image-breakers") also smashed representations of holy figures in [[stained glass]] windows and other imagery.  Further destruction of cult images, anathema to [[Puritans]], occurred during the [[English Civil War]]. Less extreme transitions occurred throughout northern Europe in which formerly Catholic churches became Protestant.  In these, the ''corpus'' (body of Christ) was removed from the crucifix leaving a bare cross and walls were  whitewashed of religious images.

Catholic regions of Europe, especially artistic centres like [[Rome]] and [[Antwerp]], responded to Reformation iconoclasm with a [[Counter-Reformation]] renewal of venerable imagery, though banning some of the more fanciful medieval iconographies.  Veneration of the Virgin Mary flourished, in practice and in imagery, and new shrines, such as in Rome's [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]], were built for [[Medieval]] miraculous [[icon]]s as part of this trend.

==Jainism==
[[File:Liberated.jpeg|thumb|Left|150px|Image of ''Siddha'' (Liberated soul) worshiped by the Jains]]
{{See also|Jain sculpture}}
In [[Jainism]], the [[Tirthankara]]s (Teaching Gods) represent the true goal of all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Zimmer |first1=Heinrich |title=Philosophies Of India |year=1953 |editor=Joseph Campbell |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |location=London, E.C. 4 |url=https://archive.org/details/Philosophy.of.India.by.Heinrich.Zimmer |isbn=978-8120807396|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their qualities are worshipped by the Jains. Images depicting any of the twenty four ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' are placed in the [[Jain temple]]s. There is no belief that the image itself is other than a representation of the being it represents. The Tirthankaras cannot respond to such veneration, but that it can function as a meditative aid. Although most veneration takes the form of prayers, hymns and recitations, the idol is sometimes ritually bathed, and often has offerings of made to it; there are eight kinds of offering representing the eight types of [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] as per Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jaina.org/educationcommittee/education_material/C15_Jain_Rituals_and_Holidays/Jain%20Rituals%20and%20Ceremonies%20-%20%20Hansa%20Sutaria.doc | format = Doc | publisher = Jaina | title = Jain rituals &amp; ceremonies | contribution = Hansa sutaria | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628175007/http://www.jaina.org/educationcommittee/education_material/C15_Jain_Rituals_and_Holidays/Jain%20Rituals%20and%20Ceremonies%20-%20%20Hansa%20Sutaria.doc | archivedate = 2007-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of reverence is not a central tenet of the faith..

==Shinto==
In [[Shinto]], cult images are called [[shintai]]. The earliest historical examples of these were natural objects such as stones, waterfalls, trees or mountains, like [[Mount Fuji]], while the vast majority are man-made objects such as swords, jewels or mirrors. Rather than being representative of or part of the [[kami]], shintai are seen as repositories in which the essence of such spirits can temporarily reside to make themselves accessible for humans to worship. A ceremony called [[kanjō]] can be used to propagate the essence of a kami into another shintai, allowing the same deity to be enshrined in multiple shrines.

[[File:Dashain Tika 02.JPG|thumb|Senior offering ''Dashain Tika'' on great Nepali [[Hindu]] festival at a traditional home.]]
The '''culture of [[Nepal]]''' is intertwined with the culture of the broader [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Tibet]]. The [[cultural heritage]] of [[Nepal]] has evolved over the centuries. This multi-dimensional heritage bounds the diversities of Nepal's [[ethnic]], [[tribal]], and [[social groups]], and it expresses in [[music]] and [[dance]]; [[art]] and [[craft]]; [[folklore]] and [[Folklore|folktales]]; [[languages]] and [[literature]]; [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]; [[festivals]] and [[Party|celebration]]; [[foods]] and [[drinks]]. Its culture is mostly influenced by [[Indian culture]] and [[Tibetan culture]].

==Dance and music==
[[File:Nepali culture.JPG|thumb|Nepali traditional Pahadi dress used for dance]]
[[Legend]]s state that [[dances]] in this country originated in the abode of Lord Shiva — the [[Himalayas]], where he performed the [[tandava]] dance. This indicates that dance traditions of Nepal are very ancient and unique. With altitudes and ethnicity, the dances of Nepal slightly change in style as well as in the [[costumes]]. The Dishka, a dance performed at weddings, includes intricate footwork and arm movements. Accompanying music and musical instruments change in tune with the themes, which revolve around topics like harvesting of crops, marriage rites, war stories, a lonely girl’s yearning for her love, and several other themes and stories from everyday life in the villages. The famous Tharu stick dances, and the crazy peacock dance are two highlights, but there are plenty of other surprises. Expect to be invited to join in the dancing, as the evening reaches its climax.

==Languages==
As per the 2011 census, 123 languages are spoken in Nepal. Nepal's linguistic heritage has evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (44.6%), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (11.7%), [[Bhojpuri]](6%), [[Tharu language|Tharu]] (5.8%), [[Tamang]] (5.1%), [[Nepal Bhasa (language)|Nepal Bhasa]] (3.2%), [[Magar language|Magar]] (3%) and [[Bajjika]] (3%) [[Kirat]]-[[Sunuwar]], [[Limbu]], [[Rai languages|Rai]], [[Gurung]], .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |title=Major highlights |work= |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics |year=2013 |page=4 |accessdate=1 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nepali language|Nepali]], written in [[Devanagari]] script, is the official national language and serves as ''lingua franca'' among Nepalese ethno-linguistic groups. Extinct languages of Nepal include [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]], MaWalinga and [[Waling]]

'''Religions and philosophy of Nepal'''

[[File:A Buddhist Monastery Nepal.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A [[Buddhist monastery]] in southern Nepal.]]
The 2001 [[census]] identified 80.6% of the population being [[Hinduism|Hindu]]. [[Buddhism]] was practiced by about 11% of the population (although many people labelled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a syncretic blend of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and/or [[animist]] traditions). About 3.2% practice [[Islam]] and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous [[Kirant]] religion. [[Christianity]] is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.

Hindu and Buddhist traditions in Nepal go back more than two [[millennia]].

Nepal has several other [[temples]] and Buddhist [[monasteries]], as well as places of worship of other religious groups. Traditionally, Nepalese [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thoughts are ingrained with the Hindu and Buddhist philosophical ethos and traditions, which include elements of [[Shaivaites|Kashmir Shaivism]], Nyingma school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], works of Karmacharyas of Bhaktapur, and tantric traditions. [[Tantra|Tantric]] traditions are deep rooted in Nepal, including the practice of animal sacrifices. Five types of animals, always male, are considered acceptable for sacrifice: [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[goats]], [[sheep]], [[chickens]], and [[ducks]]. Cows are very sacred animals and are never considered acceptable for sacrifice.

Several of the [[List of festivals in Nepal|festivals of Nepal]] last from one to several days. As a predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese festivals are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their roots in [[Hinduism]] as 82% of the population of the country is Hindu. [[Buddhism]], the second-largest religion of the nation which accounts for 9% of the population, has influenced the cultural festivals of Nepal. [[Dashain]] or [[Dusshera]] is the longest and the most important festival of Nepal. Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid-October, right after the end of the [[Monsoon|monsoon season]]. It is "a day of Victory over Demons". The [[Newar]]s celebrate the festival as [[Mohani]]. [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] or [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Saraswati Puja]], [[Rakshabandhan]], [[Bhai Dooj]], [[Janmashtami]], [[Kali Puja]], Gai Jatra, Nag Panchami, [[Teej]], [[Chhath]], [[Kartik Poornima]], [[Maghe Sankranti]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Maha Shivratri]] and [[Chhechu]] are other widely celebrated important festivals of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar [[Nepal Sambat]] occurs in November. Several Jatras take place throughout the year and public holidays are declared in some regions.

Other important festivals include [[Buddha Purnima]] (the celebration of the birth of Buddha)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL= http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/buddha-purnima|title=Buddha jayanti|publisher=Weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shivaratri|Maha Shivaratri]] (a festival of [[Shive|Lord Shiva]]) and during [[Maha Shivaratri]] festivities, some people consume excessive [[drinks]]  and smoke [[charas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.weallnepali.com/nepali-festivals/maha-shivaratri|title=Mahashivaratri|publisher=weallnepali|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], mostly located at higher altitudes and in the [[Mount Everest]] region, celebrate ''Mani Rimdu'', for ''the good of the world''.

Most festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods are consumed during festivals and on special occasions.

The [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagan ceremony]] is the ritualized presentation of five food items (boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine) to a person which is done to bring good fortune as per [[Tantra|Tantric]] tradition.

{{nihongo|'''''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'''''|デビルサバイバーツー ジ・アニメーション|Debiru Sabaibā Tsū Ji Animēshon|lead=yes}} is a 2013 Japanese [[anime]] series based on the [[Nintendo DS]] video game, ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2]]'' by [[Atlus]]. The series was directed by [[Seiji Kishi]], with series composition by [[Makoto Uezu]], based on the original story by Atlus and animated by [[Bridge (studio)|Bridge]]. The series stars voice actors [[Hiroshi Kamiya]] as Hibiki Kuze along with [[Nobuhiko Okamoto]], [[Aya Uchida]], [[Junichi Suwabe]] and [[Takahiro Sakurai]]. When a mysterious calamity plunges the world into a state of chaos, Hibiki Kuze and his friends Daichi Shijima and Io Nitta are suddenly thrown from their normal lives into a battle of survival against creatures called Septentriones seeking to bring the world to ruin. Gaining the ability to summon [[demons]] from a [[Mobile app|cell phone app]], Hibiki and his friends team up with an organization known as the JP's to help protect Japan and above all else—survive.

The thirteen episode series premiered in Japan on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] on April 4, 2013 and was subsequently licensed by [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by [[MVM Entertainment]] in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in ''[[Gangan Comics#Monthly GFantasy|Monthly GFantasy]]'' between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by [[Kodansha Box]]. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs along with a host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for its dark animation styles and backgrounds. However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were impactful to the viewer.

==Plot==
One Sunday afternoon, Hibiki Kuze and Daichi Shijima receive macabre videos from the {{Nihongo foot|Nicaea|ニカイア|Nikaia|group=J}} website which predict their deaths mere seconds before they are involved in a gruesome train accident. They are spared however, when a {{nihongo foot|Demon Summoning App|悪魔召喚アプリ|Akuma Shōkan Apuri|group=J}} installs itself on their phones and allows the duo and schoolmate Io Nitta to escape from carnivorous monsters feasting on the dead in the wrecked subway station. The trio are shocked to discover a massive catastrophe on the surface and take refuge in Roppongi with other panicked citizens. Suddenly, when a creature known as {{Nihongo4|Dubhe|ドゥベ|Duube}} appears and attacks the crowd, Hibiki puts a stop to the carnage by summoning a demon from the app and destroying the creature. This prompts the {{nihongo foot|Japan Meteorological Agency, Geomagnetism Research Department - JP's|気象庁・指定地磁気調査部、「ジプス」|Kishōchō. Shitei Chijiki Chōsa bu, 'Jipusu'|group=J}} to detain Hibiki and his friends and they are brought before its head—Yamato Hotsuin, who enlists their aid in defeating the remaining {{nihongo foot|Septentriones|セプテントリオン|Seputentorion|group=J}} to prevent the end of the world in one week.

Yamato then dispatches them on a mission to retrieve the JP's scientist Fumi Kanno with fellow demon summoners Hinako Kujou and Keita Wakui, which ends up as a success at the cost of Keita's life. Following a devastating battle with {{Nihongo4|Merak|メラク|Meraku}}, Hibiki joins the Resistance leader—Ronaldo Kuriki and learns of [[meritocracy|Yamato's true intentions]] as opposed to [[Egalitarianism|his own]]. As events progress, Airi Ban and Jungo Torii attempt to recapture the JP's base from the Resistance but chaos ensues when {{Nihongo4|Phecda|フェクダ|Fekuda}} appears and targets a defenseless Hibiki. However Yamato arrives and slays the Septentrione, saving Hibiki's life. In the aftermath, Yamato and Ronaldo engage in a heated debate over their ideals and the situation only escalates when Alcor appears and proclaims himself to be the creator of both Nicaea and the Demon Summoning App, which he had hoped would aid humanity in their darkest hour.

An unlikely alliance between the JP's, Resistance and the unaffiliated demon summoners result in the destruction of {{Nihongo4|Megrez|メグレズ|Megurezu}} the following day. While a somber Hibiki struggles to cope with the steep cost of victory, Alcor reveals the true nature of events thus far. He explains it all to be the will of an entity known as {{Nihongo4|Polaris|ポラリス|Porarisu}} as it seeks to erase humanity's "artificial" reality using its Void phenomenon and hence restore the "natural" order. Therefore, it sent the Septentriones to destroy the spiritual barriers protecting Japan from the Void. When Hinako and Airi defeat {{Nihongo4|Alioth|アリオト|Arioto}} the next day, its massive shell plummets from orbit and crushes the city—killing thousands more people and sparking outrage from Hibiki over the lengths Yamato will go to achieve his goal. Unperturbed, Yamato uses Io to summon a demon called Lugh and defeats the next Septentrione—{{Nihongo4|Mizar|ミザール|Mizaaru}}. However, when the demon possesses Io and attempts to kill Yamato for its imprisonment, Hibiki wields the {{Nihongo foot|Dragon Stream|龍脈|Ryumyaku|group=J}} and saves Io.

As the week draws to a close, {{Nihongo4|Benetnasch|ベネトナシュ|Benetonashu}} appears on Saturday and completely destroys the barriers. Upon engaging the creature, Yamato allows the other summoners to die by ignoring them in the battle and ultimately defeats it with Hibiki and Daichi's help. In the aftermath, Alcor decides to support Hibiki and Yamato ends up killing him. Finally, Yamato activates the Transport Terminal to seek an audience with Polaris and Io and Daichi forfeit their lives to give Hibiki a chance at going after Yamato and saving the world. Facing each other in another dimension, Hibiki desperately tries to reach out to Yamato and ultimately overpowers him with aid from his fallen comrades. Polaris then appears and Hibiki asks it to restore the world to the way it was. He then finds himself one week in the past, with his revived friends and his memory intact and reifies the will of humanity to keep on living.

[[Makoto Uezu]] was selected as both the script writer and series composer for the anime. In an interview, Uezu commented that he had been a huge fan of the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series since his childhood and that his interests in the [[occult]] and electronic technology aided in the composition. Uezu further remarked that the story followed a "hard path" whereby the heroes were forced into making difficult choices at key points in the plot whilst the characters simultaneously explored sensitive issues related to human ethics and morality.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 01"/&gt;

The series' character designs were drawn by Etsushi Sajima and were based on the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 01"/&gt; The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before he could see the animated versions of his designs.&lt;ref name="DS2A Staff Comments 02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ds2a.jp/special/comment02.html|title=Special｜TVアニメ「デビルサバイバー2」公式サイト［DEVIL SURVIVOR2 the ANIMATION］|publisher=[[Pony Canyon]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=August 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815140805/http://ds2a.jp/special/comment02.html|archivedate=August 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the series' creatures i.e. the various ''devils'' (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop designs were done by Hatsue Nakayama and color designs were done by Keiichi Funada.

===Music and audio===

''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' uses three pieces of [[theme music]]: one opening theme, one closing theme and one insert song. The theme sequences are not used consistently throughout the series since the episode producers decided to prioritize story-telling to their use which helped keep the plot within thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 01"/&gt; The anime debuted with "Take Your Way" by [[Livetune]] feat.

A seasonal review column on the [[Anime News Network]] called ''The Stream'' generally made light remarks of the first four episodes. Written by Bamboo Dong, the editor called the series mindlessly fun; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as if they would be incapable of fighting if it were otherwise. Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-05-06#ds2|title=#11 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 1-4]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=May 6, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309024236/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-05-06#ds2|archivedate=March 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-03#ds2|title=#14 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 5-8]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024311/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-03#ds2|archivedate=April 5, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the editor described the immense amount of [video game] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy. Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die. The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied, but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story. After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-24#ds2|title=#10 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 9-12]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418055358/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-06-24#ds2|archivedate=April 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed out as much as they could have been. Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a ''disappearing world'', it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-07-15#ds2|title=#12 - ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' [ep. 13]|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711021924/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-07-15#ds2|archivedate=July 11, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dong presented a full series review in their ''Shelf Life'' column and expressed that viewers who like brawn, action and some emotion will enjoy the series as long as they can come to terms with the fact that they'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-06-30/.76151#ds2|title=Rental Shelf ''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' BD|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2015|first=Bamboo|last=Dong|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424134442/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-06-30/.76151#ds2|archivedate=April 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanto-daishinsai.jpg|right|thumb|The destruction caused in the series was thought of as being similar to the real-world devastation brought to Japan by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].]]
''The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide'' written by Rebecca Silverman, also of the Anime News Network, expressed differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention that she had not previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca|title=The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide / ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation''|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2013|first=Rebecca|last=Silverman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407042606/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2013/the-spring-anime/rebecca|archivedate=April 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.&lt;ref name="Silverman Review 01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/devil-survivor-2-the-animation|title=Review: ''Devil Survivor 2 The Animation'' by Rebecca Silverman|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013|first=Rebecca|last=Silverman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825031135/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/devil-survivor-2-the-animation|archivedate=August 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] disliked the series so much that he discouraged viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis Review 00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/four-anime-you-can-skip-this-season-507970495|title=Four Anime You Can Skip This Season|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013|first=Richard|last=Eisenbeis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122063852/http://kotaku.com/four-anime-you-can-skip-this-season-507970495|archivedate=November 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the "woefully underdeveloped" characters of ''Devil Survivor 2'' who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who exactly is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or [[antihero]]) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/devil-survivor-2-is-much-better-than-i-expected-958700348|title=''Devil Survivor 2'' Is Much Better Than I Expected|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2013|first=Richard|last=Eisenbeis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906060219/http://kotaku.com/devil-survivor-2-is-much-better-than-i-expected-958700348|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley review the first four episodes and he expressed a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers. Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an ''in at the deep end'' experience. Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo at the end of the first episode and the countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this. Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged.&lt;ref name="Hanley Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Devil_Survivor_2:_The_Animation_-_Eps._1-4.html|title=ANIME REVIEW: ''Devil Survivor 2: The Animation'' - Eps. 1-4|publisher=UK Anime Network|date=|accessdate=July 22, 2014|first=Andy|last=Hanley|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403234942/http://uk-anime.net/anime/Devil_Survivor_2:_The_Animation_-_Eps._1-4.html|archivedate=April 3, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Edward''' “'''Ed'''” '''Ross''' (October 27, 1965 – July 30, 2016) was an American [[tintype]] photographer and lawyer. His photography work spanned 27 years. His last six years were devoted exclusively to wet-plate photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus as an artist was primarily on [[Portrait photography|nude portraits]] and [[landscape photography]].

==History==
Ross was born in [[Ukiah, California]] to Bill and Dorothy Ross and raised in [[Davis, California]]. He attended Jesuit High School in [[UC San Diego]], studied at the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[UC Hastings]] School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Member Detail|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/173048|publisher=The State Bar of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as senior legal counsel for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer company in [[Cupertino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Edward Ross - Obituary|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/obits/michael-edward-ross/|website=davisenterprise.com|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Ross had taken photographs for 27 years, and during the last eight years of his life used the [[Collodion process]] or wet-plates for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ross worked with three different cameras: a half-plate box-style camera made by Ty Guillory, an 8×10 bellows-style camera made by Black Art Woodcraft, and a 16×20 Chamonix. He used ‘period’ lenses, manufactured between 1850 and 1900, by Dallmeyer, Voigtlander, and Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jane|first1=Katherine|title=The Quite Delightful Project|url=https://quitedelightfulproject.com/journal/ed-ross-interview-2/|website=quitedelightfulproject.com|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUDES AND PORTRAITS BY ED ROSS|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/erotica/nudes-and-portraits-by-ed-ross/|website=juxtapoz.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical drama]], the '''epitasis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπίτασις}}) is the main action of a play, in which the trials and tribulations of the main character increase and build toward a climax and dénouement. It is the third and central part when a play is analyzed into five separate parts: prelude, [[protasis]], epitasis, [[catastasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].

In modern [[dramatic theory]], the [[Dramatic structure|dramatic arc]] is often referred to, which uses somewhat different divisions but is substantially the same concept overall.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

Female [[street art]]ists have become a common phenomenon in [[Egypt]], especially after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|revolution of 2011]]. This kind of art became a way to address many women-related issues in Egypt that are not merely related to political developments, such as the status of women in society and sexual harassment. Notable female artists include Aya Tarek and Hend Kheera, while collaborations include Women on Walls and NooNeswa among others.

==Background==

===Voices in Street Art===
The public nature of street art provides a forum for those who are silenced by cultural or political oppression to be heard. Typically well planned and designed, street art is often created to send a message about a specific issue or topic. In a 2014 Al Jazeera article, Women on Walls founder Mia Grondahl states "Street art is all about "strengthening the people, being with the people, listening to the people." &lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;
{{cite news

  |last=Wolf|first=Mat
  |title=Egypt's graffiti artists make their mark
  |work=Al Jazeera
  |date=6 May 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban life is centered within the confines of the city's buildings, and the existence of street art makes witnessing the statements behind it unavoidable. As stated by Angie Balata, "Everyone who sees it receives the same message — even those who don't necessarily want to receive it."&lt;ref name=Observers&gt;
{{cite web

  |title=Egyptian women fight for equality with graffiti
  |work=Observers
  |publisher=france24.com
  |date=29 April 2013
  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In societies where certain groups are not given equal footing in social and political settings, this alternative form of speech is an outlet for those voices.

===Street art and the revolution===
Before the revolution of 2011 in Egypt, street art was not a common presence. There were only a few artists using public space as a canvas prior to 2011. Before this time, street art was seen as a suspicious activity and could be stopped legally.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;

  |publisher=jadaliyya.com
  |date=25 January 2013
  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political revolution in Egypt was focused on overthrowing former president Hosni Mubarek. Street art at this time gave men and women a way to speak out against the military ruling. Since the end of the revolution, street art has continued to be a way for artists to protest.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=suzee&gt;

  |work=Suzee in the City
  |date=7 January 2013
  |accessdate=2 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple common themes speak out against the Muslim Brotherhood and gender inequality.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;

Street art, beginning with the Egyptian revolution, has even given way to collaborations such as Women on Walls (WOW) who focus specifically on women's rights statistics. One artist said, "If you want to tell people something in Egypt, you've got to tell them in the street." Art has become the way to voice an opinion in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;

==Women in street art==
Traditionally, Muslim women have been confined to the home and to private space, while public space has belonged to men.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street art gives women a voice in the public space that they have often been denied. Groups such as Noon El Neswa, NooNewsa, and Women on Walls have been running campaigns to claim a position for women in the public by bringing both women's artists and women's issues to the streets.&lt;ref name=ElNabawi&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nawara Belal, a member of NooNewsa, stated, "Women are not comfortable in public spaces. We must feel that we belong there, that it's our zone."&lt;ref name=Fecteau/&gt; In addition to groups there are many individual female artists operating in Egypt. Until recently, there were very few women or women-related issues depicted in street art, or, if there were, the women were depicted in an insulting way.&lt;ref name=Barakat/&gt;&lt;ref name=ElNabawi/&gt; Now, women in Egypt are using art that features women not only to comment on politics in Egypt, but also to address and raise awareness about issues directly affecting their lives. Common themes amongst these artists include the status of women in Egypt, gender disparities, and the high rates of sexual assault in the country.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barakat/&gt;

==Important artists and collaborations==
===Aya Tarek===
According to the well-known Arab blogger, "Suzee in the City," '''Aya Tarek''' is an Alexandrian street artist; one of the first recognized Egyptian street artists.&lt;ref name=suzee/&gt; She began her street artwork before the Egyptian revolution and refers to the street art as "an open gallery."&lt;ref name=LeilZahra&gt;

===Hend Kheera===
Well known Egyptian street artist, '''Hend Kheera''' was an active participant in the first months of the Egyptian revolution.&lt;ref name=Peirandrei&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work Kheera questions the social norms in Egypt, discusses her personal experiences as a woman, and contributes to anti-sexual harassment campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Hend Kheera
  |publisher=WomenOnWalls
  |date=20 September 2014
  |accessdate=7 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Kheera sympathized with the idea that street art has a strong voice, claiming "You write on a wall in the street to speak to people. In my opinion, a wall is more powerful than any media channel, for example, because you can't ignore it…By making graffiti in the streets [you] make people aware of what's happening."&lt;ref&gt;

===Women on Walls===
'''WOW''', began by Mia Grondahl and Angie Balata, focuses specifically on women's rights statistics and women's empowerment. They work with political, economical, social, and cultural topics. It began as a very small campaign and now has more than 60 artists working in both Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref name=Wolf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===NooNewsa===
This group focuses on changing the attitude toward women in Egypt, through projects such as Graffiti Harimi (Female Graffiti), which aims to break social taboos. '''NooNewsa''' is dedicated to making women feel comfortable in public space. They want to give the people positive images of women and often use well-known female figures as subjects in their art.&lt;ref name=Fecteau/&gt;

'''''First Love''''' ({{lang-ru|Первая любовь}}, ''Pervaya ljubov'') is a [[novella]] by [[Ivan Turgenev]], first published in 1860. It is one of his most popular pieces of short fiction. It tells the love story between a 21-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.

==Background to the work==
''First Love'' was published in March 1860 in the ''[[Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya|Reader's Library]]''. Like many of Turgenev's works, this one is highly autobiographical. Indeed, the author claimed it was the most autobiographical of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, David. 1954. ''Turgenev: a Life.'' London: Faber and Faber, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Turgenev is retelling an incident from his own life, his infatuation with a young neighbor in the country, Catherine Shakovskoy (the Zinaida of the novella), an infatuation that lasted until his discovery that Catherine was in fact his own father's mistress.

Critics were divided. Some criticized its light subject matter that did not touch upon any of the pressing social and political issues of the day. Others condemned the impropriety of that subject matter, namely a father and son in love with the same woman and a young woman who was the mistress of a married man. But it had its many admirers, including the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]], who gushed in [[Flaubert's letters|a letter]] to Turgenev, "What an exciting girl that Zinochka [Zinaida] is!"&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The Countess Lambert, a close acquaintance of Turgenev, told the author that the [[Alexander III of Russia|Russian emperor]] himself had read the novella to the empress and been delighted by it.&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, Henri. 1988. ''Turgenev'' (New York: Dutton), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central characters==

'''Vladimir Petrovich''' – The storyteller, at the time of narration a 16-year-old boy; the protagonist of the story.

'''Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekina''' – The object of Vladimir's affections. Capricious, mocking and difficult, she is inconsistent in her affections towards her suitors, of which Vladimir is the one to whom she shows (outwardly) the most affection. However, it is the affection of sister to brother rather than between lovers.

'''Pyotr Vasilyevich''' – Vladimir's father, a stoic symbol of 19th century masculinity; very 'British' in outlook and apparently unreceptive to emotion but the object of quiet admiration by the son

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17503">The '''Free Southern Theater''' ('''FST''') was a community theater group founded in 1963 at [[Tougaloo College]] in [[Madison County, Mississippi]], by [[Gilbert Moses]], [[Denise Nicholas]], [[Doris Derby]], and John O’Neal. The company manager was [[Mary Lovelace O'Neal|Mary Lovelace]], later Chair of the Art Department at [[U.C. Berkeley]]. The company disbanded in 1980.

The Free Southern Theater was a part of the emerging Black Theatre Movement and also closely allied with the [[civil rights movement]]—O’Neal and Derby were also directors of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name=Breunlin&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/legacyfreesouttheater.htm The Legacy of the Free Southern Theater in New Orleans], Interviews by Rachel Breunlin.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented plays by [[Langston Hughes]], [[John O. Killens]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[Ossie Davis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/RPW.reel_.3.FST%20Brochure.pg%2012-19.pdf Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities at Vanderbilt University: The Free Southern Theater.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing a space for their members to write their own plays.

The founders sought to introduce free theater to the South, both as a voice for social protest, and to emphasize positive aspects of [[African-American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  O’Neal, Derby, and Moses outlined the philosophy of the troupe in a founding document:&lt;ref name=veterans&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Civil Rights Movement Veterans Website: Free Southern Theater Founded]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our fundamental objective is to stimulate creative and reflective thought among Negroes in Mississippi and other Southern states by the establishment of a legitimate theater, thereby providing the opportunity in the theater and the associated art forms. We theorize that within the Southern situation a theatrical form and style can be developed that is as unique to the Negro people as the origin of blues and jazz. A combination of art and social awareness can evolve into plays written for a Negro audience, which relate to the problems within the Negro himself, and within the Negro community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mission ==
In 1963, John O'Neal, Doris Derby, Gilbert Moses, and William Hutchinson drafted "A General Prospectus for the Establishment of a Free Southern Theater, Jackson, Mississippi." This document outlined the goals of the theater company and how they would accomplish them. They included:
# To acquaint Southern peoples with a breadth of experience with the theater and related art forms
# To liberate and to explore the creative talent and potential that is here as well as to promote the production of art
# To develop an appreciation of the theater and related art forms- an understanding of the technical problems as well as ideas and concepts
# To bring in artists from outside the state as well as to provide the opportunity for local people with creative ability to have experience with the theater
# To emphasize the universality of the problems of the Negro people
# To strengthen communication between Southern Negroes
# To assert that self-knowledge and creativity are the foundations of Human Dignity&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.tulane.edu/exhibits/items/show/634|title=A General Prospectus for the Establishment of a Free Southern Theater, Jackson, Mississippi|last=Free Southern Theater|first=|date=1963|website=Tulane University Online Exhibits|publisher=|access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With these goals in mind, they solidified a mission statement: "Our objective is to stimulate creative and reflective thought among Negroes in Mississippi and other Southern states by the establishment of a legitimate theater, thereby providing the opportunity for involvement in the theater and associated art forms."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==

The Free Southern Theater was formed in September 1963 when Gilbert Moses and John O’Neal met in Mississippi while working with the [[civil rights movement]]. Their first production, ''In White America'', toured 16 towns and cities ranging in size from Mileston in [[Holmes County, Mississippi]], to [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gilbert Moses, John O'Neil, Denise Nicholas, Murray Levy, Richard Schecner, "Dialog: The Free Southern Theater (1965)", in Bean, Annemarie, ''A Sourcebook of African-American Performance Plays, People, Movements''. London: Routledge, 1999, pp. 102–113. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Moses recalls: "The Holmes County people came in from the farms to see us. We had to play in the afternoon because they wanted to get back home by dark."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For professional help in theater management the Free Southern Theater began working with professor [[Richard Schechner]], then at [[Tulane University]], who joined the theatre as one of its producing directors.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  They toured rural Louisiana and Mississippi presenting plays such as [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. Initially consisting of both black and white actors, the company gradually became exclusively African-American and presented only plays by black playwrights such as the controversial [[LeRoi Jones]] (later known as Amiri Baraka).

From the first, the company was plagued by artistic and managerial disagreements;&lt;ref name=Breunlin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and, with free admission as a primary objective, money was always in short supply. Following their January 1965 tour, the company did fundraising performances in New York.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under financial duress and hoping to draw on a larger middle class black population, the troupe moved to [[New Orleans]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; where they purchased an office space and gathered a board of directors. The company went from eight members to twenty-three.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1966 Moses, Schechner, and O’Neal left, and the company was taken over by African-American poet and writer [[Thomas Dent (writer)|Thomas Dent]] assisted by [[Kalamu ya Salaam|Val Ferdinand]] (later known as Kalamu ya Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2514/Dent-Thomas-Covington.html Brief Biographies]: Thomas Covington Dent Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched workshops for actors and introduced plays written by their own members.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  They adapted the play ''In White America'' by [[Martin Duberman]] to depict the murders of [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) field workers [[James Chaney]], [[Michael Schwerner]], and [[Andrew Goodman]], killed in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also performed ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]].&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ossie Davis's "Purlie Victorious".&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Schechner, Moses.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in spite of grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[Ford Foundation]]s, and support from celebrities including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Julian Bond]], The Free Southern Theater gradually lost its creative momentum and financial support.&lt;ref name=veterans/&gt; In 1980, The Free Southern Theater closed, however the 1985 production ''A Funeral for the Free Southern Theater: A Valediction Without Mourning'', honored the company “featuring a jazz funeral and a three-day conference of art for social change”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alternateroots.org/from-script-to-screen-documenting-the-free-southern-theater/|title=From Script to Screen Documenting the Free Southern Theater|last=Jason Foster|first=Kiyoko McCrae|date=February 2, 2016|website=Alternative Roots|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John O’Neal’s theater company Junebug Productions strives to carry on the legacy of the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition to John O'Neal and Gilbert Moses, well known actors who appeared in FST productions included [[Roscoe Orman]],&lt;ref name="Breunlin" /&gt; and [[Denise Nicholas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilib.usm.edu/cdm/search/searchterm/%20Nicholas,%20Denise,%201944-/mode/exact The University of Southern Mississippi: Digital Collections.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding members ==

=== Gilbert Moses ===
[[Gilbert Moses]], a founding member of The Free Southern Theater and noted theater director, was born in Cleveland in August 1942.  As a student at [[Oberlin College]], Moses studied for a year at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris before leaving school to join the civil rights movement. During his time in Mississippi, Moses served as a journalist for the ''Mississippi Free Press''. ''New York Times'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] observes that an interest in the work of [[Jean Vilar]] and the [[Théâtre National Populaire|Theatre National Populaire]] led Moses to pursue more "socially relevant theater".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/18/obituaries/gilbert-moses-is-dead-at-52-award-winning-stage-director.html|title=Gilbert Moses Is Dead at 52; Award-Winning Stage Director|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=1995-04-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his involvement with The Free Southern Theater, Moses directed stage productions both on and off-Broadway. In 1969 Moses won an [[Obie Award]] for [[Amiri Baraka]]'s 1969 play ''Slave Ship''. Reflecting on a 1972 ''New York Times'' interview with Moses, Gussow observes how he "called for a deeper investigation of the lives of black people in the United States".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He quotes Moses, “We as blacks are starved for images of ourselves all over this country”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Moses died of [[multiple myeloma]] in April 1995.

=== Doris Derby ===
Born in either 1939 or 1940 in the [[The Bronx|Bronx, New York]], [[Doris Derby]]’s long career has spread across a wide array of disciplines, ranging from theater to education. From an early age, Derby expressed strong interest in community activism and civil rights and joined a [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) youth group in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights History Project, US, Joseph Mosnier, and Doris Adelaide Derby. ''Doris Adelaide Derby oral history interview conducted by Joseph Mosnier in Atlanta, Georgia, 2011-04-26''. Atlanta, Georgia, None , 4, 2011. Video. Retrieved from the Library of Congress, &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.loc.gov/item/2015669107/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As a student at [[Hunter College]] in New York, Derby was a member of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aas.msstate.edu/fsc/guests/|title=Freedom Summer Conference :: African American Studies :: College of Arts &amp; Sciences|last=Dev|first=ITS Web|website=www.aas.msstate.edu|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department of African American studies at [[Mississippi State University]] observes that the SNCC “organized voter registration drives, self help economic and educational initiatives and carried out protests at such places as segregated local, statewide and national governmental facilities, public movie theaters, parks, medical facilities and churches”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Derby’s work within the SNCC was centered, primarily, in New York, Georgia, and Mississippi. In Mississippi Derby taught adult literacy through the SNCC and helped found ''The Free Southern Theater''. In 1990, Derby joined the faculty of [[Georgia State University]] and served as the founding Director of the Office of African American Student Services and Programs, as well as, Adjunct Associate Professor of Cultural Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A noted photographer, as well, Derby’s work has been exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts|Bronx Museum of Art]]. Her documentary photographs are known to “depict the life of struggling Americans who defied the post-emancipation status quo brought about by political, economic, social and cultural domination and exploitation”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2012, Derby retired from Georgia State University following a successful 22 years of service.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== John O’Neal ===
Like fellow FST founder, Doris Derby, John O’Neal worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi as a field director. O’Neal also served as national field program director of the Committee for Racial Justice. The recipient of the Award of Merit from the [[Association of Performing Arts Presenters]] and a [[Ford Foundation|Ford Foundation Award]], O’Neal has written eighteen plays, a musical comedy, poetry, and several essays.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://junebugproductions.org/about/board-members/|title=Board Members {{!}} Junebug Productions|website=junebugproductions.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, ''The Free Southern Theater'' produced their final performance, a solo piece written and performed by O’Neal titled ''Don't Start Me to Talking or I’ll Tell Everything I Know''. The play features the character Junebug Jabbo Jones, “created by the SNCC members to represent and symbolize the wit and wisdom of common folk”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcg.org/fifty/EDI/groundat20john.cfm|title=The Ground at 20: John O’Neal, Free Southern Theater &amp; Junebug Productions|last=|first=|date=|website=Theatre Communications Group|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performance marked the final production of the FST, but also signified the creation of O’Neal’s new theater company, Junebug Productions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; John O’Neal currently serves as the Founding Director and Artistic Director Emeritus for Junebug Productions.

== Notable productions ==
The first productions put on by the Free Southern Theatre were ''In White America'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. These productions toured through the poor areas of the south, especially in Mississippi, where the company was founded. As part of their mission, the shows never charged an entry fee and performed in public places like churches and community halls. As mentioned in the History section, their production of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' was performed in whiteface since most of the cast was African American at the time. The theater also performed [[Purlie|''Purlie Victorious'']]. In a ''New York Times'' article, a company member only referred to as "James" (James Cromwell, who played Pozzo) describes the enthusiasm that [[Waiting for Godot|Godot]] received from the audiences in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.synaptic.att.com/rest/objects/4a08bf2ea61f2e0e04f4ffec85b79604f5fd9dbec87a?uid=7be5f8cb9eb14188b0e40ae93aca2099%2FkingcenterATpalantirDOTnet&amp;expires=1590984000&amp;signature=VGCVGx25H8yq1zKh3Op2SZmB1oA%3D|title=They Are Waiting for Godot In Mississippi, Too|last=Minor|first=W.F.|date=31 January 1965|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==
In addition to free performances throughout its existence, the Free Southern Theatre remained rooted in its Civil Rights roots. They had workshops for the community and college students at various stops on their tours, an acting apprenticeship, and a sponsorship program for local artists in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/u/0/exhibit/wgJy0M-5vTtQIg|title=The Free Southern Theater  - Google Arts &amp; Culture|newspaper=Google Cultural Institute|language=en|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their partnership with the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] was essential for them to gain funding and support in order to continue their mission.

The Free Southern Theater had to end its operations in 1980. Their mission did not entirely end, however, as [http://junebugproductions.org/ Junebug Productions] was formed in the shadow of the Free Southern Theater. This company is still working in several communities in the south in order to bring arts to areas that need it most. Their biggest project is the [http://animatingdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/documents/labs/color_line_project_case_study.pdf National Color Line Project] in which the company travels and collects stories surrounding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and uses them to archive history as well as bring new light to the current racial situation in the [[United States|U.S.]]

The '''Fresno Art Museum''' is an art museum in [[Fresno, California]]. The museum's collection includes contemporary art, [[modern art]], [[Mexican art|Mexican]] and Mexican-American art, and [[Pre-Columbian art|Pre-Columbian]] sculpture.&lt;ref name=Michaelson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michaelson|first1=Judith|title=Central Valley's Fresno: Home of Raisins--and Art?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-06/entertainment/ca-19746_1_fresno-art-museum|accessdate=8 November 2015|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=6 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the museum website, the museum descends from the Fresno Art League, a group of local artists that was founded in the late 1940s and that gathered sufficient community support to incorporate as the Fresno Art Center in 1949 and to erect an Art Center building in Radio Park in 1960.  The [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museums]] granted the Art Center accreditation in 1973.

Under the direction of [[Robert D. Barrett|Robert Barrett]],&lt;ref&gt;http://robertbarrettartist.com&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 the name was changed to Fresno Arts Center and Museum, and then again in 1988 changed again to Fresno Art Museum.&lt;ref name=MuseumWebsite&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum History|url=http://www.fresnoartmuseum.org/about/history/|publisher=Fresno Art Museum|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Barrett, the Museums Director and Curator through 1980 up until 1994 was the driving force by the museums expansion, collection growth, establishment of an endowment fund, growth in adult education through a partnership with Fresno City College and even attempted to raise the and tourism in an initiative called "Arts to Zoo".&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-06/entertainment/ca-19746_1_fresno-art-museum city tax for art&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noteworthy artists and exhibitions ==
The Fresno Art Museum became renowned for its exhibitions of [[Feminist Art]] going from an unknown "art center" to nationally known with an exhibit of the artist [[Judy Chicago]]'s "[[the Dinner Party]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-judy-chicago-15708&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum worked closely with major California galleries such as [[Mekler Gallery]], [[Joan Wheeler|Ankrum Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-joan-ankrum-12691&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Rutberg Fine Arts|Jack Rutberg]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackrutbergfinearts.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toby C Moss Gallery]], [[Dorothy Goldeen Gallery|Dorothy Goldeen]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/dorothy-goldeen-gallery-records-11094/series-4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Baum Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/2008.M.61/2008.M.61.xml&lt;/ref&gt; who had access to major California art collections as well as held amazing inventory of major California artists. With Robert Barrett as curator, the museum put together exhibitions with printed catalogs art artist including [[Picasso]], [[Goya]], [[Pissaro]], [[Helen Lundeberg]], [[Ynez Johnston]],&lt;ref&gt;https://americanart.si.edu/artist/ynez-johnston-2489&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Weisberg]], [[Barbara Pilakowski Barrett|Barbara Barrett]], [[Frank Lobdell]], [[Lee Mullican]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oral-history-interviews-california-artists-6649&lt;/ref&gt; [[F Scott Hess]], [[David Ligare]], [[Darren Waterston]],&lt;ref&gt;http://darrenwaterston.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2014-Waterston.Resume.Complete.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betye Saar]], [[Robert Cremean]], [[Rodan]], [[Fletcher Benton]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/fletcher-benton-papers-13352/series-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Falkenstein]], [[Emerson Woelffer]], [[August Madrigal]], [[Gronk (artist)|Gronk]], [[Frank Romero]], [[Gilbert Magu Lujan]], [[Kathryn Jacobi]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dianefarrisgallery.com/artist/jacobi/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Sonfist]], [[Nancy Yodelman]], [[EZ Smith]], [[Melvin Schuler]], [[Bruce Beasely]], [[Christo]], [[Morris Gaylord Broderson|Morris Broderson]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.annexgalleries.com/artists/biography/282/Broderson/Morris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-morris-broderson-12187&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathy Wosika]], [[Tom Foolery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missoulaartmuseum.org/index.php/ID/e53b38fdb2d9cabda9c72c1602a36720/fuseaction/exhibitions.detail.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sloan Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/43774471_susan-sloan-lewis-studio-pottery-porcelain-platter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Renzi]], [[Beth Van Hoesen]], [[Mark Adams (artist)|Mark Adams]], [[James H Shepard]],&lt;ref&gt;http://galwest.com/fine_art/tiwi_wood/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://donnasharrockwebb.com/archives/1175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millard Sheets]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/millard-sheets-papers-10956/series-9&lt;/ref&gt; many of which where career changers for the artist. An excellent example is the "DJUNA set" an exhibition and catalog of [[June Wayne]]'s [[lithographs]] which revitalized her career.

The Fresno Art Museum while under Robert Barrett's leadership along with Board Member [[George Y Blair]] in late 1990 set up a trust to acquire the estate, including the artwork of renowned American sculptor [[Robert Cremean]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pmcaonline.org/exhibitions/robert-cremean/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews-and-relating-to-robert-cremean-videorecording-6212&lt;/ref&gt; After Barrett's departure from the Museum, the relationship became tenuous. Cremean accused the museum, specifically Blair, of not living up to the contractual agreement associated with the trust.  In particular, the contract stated the museum would house as well as display on an ongoing basis Cremean's art. With Barrett's departure, fundraising slowed, and the museum's board floundered in hiring a new director. Thus, without any art leadership, Cremean became frustrated. Eventually, Cremean sued Blair and the Fresno Art Museum which ended in the dissolution of the contract. While some very exquisite examples of Robert Cremean's work still reside at the Fresno Art Museum, Cremean moved his home state of Ohio taking his collection and estate with him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-cremean-12401&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguished Woman Artist Award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fresnoartmuseum.org/exhibitions/distinguished-women-artists/&lt;/ref&gt; ==

The Council of 100 presents the [[Distinguished Woman Artist Award]] annually to a woman artist who has spent thirty or more years in the studio and has created a unique and prestigious body of work.

=== History of the Distinguished Women Artists and the Council of 100 ===
The Fresno Art Museum was the first museum in the United States to devote a full year of their exhibition schedule, 1986/87, exclusively for [[women artists]]. Fresno was a fitting place to do this, since, in the early 1970s, [[Judy Chicago]] brought attention to women artists when she taught the first feminist art class in the country at [[California State University, Fresno]].

In order to finance the cost of this year of exhibitions, it was necessary to match a grant for $25,000. [[Robert D. Barrett|Robert Barrett]], executive director of the museum, suggested the means to raise the funds; to enlist 100 women from the community, each of whom would donate $250 to the museum for this project. Weekly meetings were scheduled to inform the invited women about the project and their involvement with it. The group would be called the Council of 100. Over one hundred women participated and many of those women continue to support this program today.

The year of exhibitions drew national attention and interest and culminated in a three-day symposium in May 1987. The symposium brought together an important group of artists, art scholars, critics and museum directors from across the country. This national interest and recognition of the Fresno Art Museum and its program for [[women artists]] continues today through the efforts of the Council of 100.

The energy created by that year of women artists' exhibitions, as well as the symposium, was so stimulating for the Fresno Art Museum audience that the Council of 100, headed by [[Virginia Farquhar]], decided to keep its role alive at the Museum by expanding its mission to include the following objectives: (1) in collaboration with the Fresno Art Museum, select an outstanding woman artist annually to present an exhibition of her work at the Museum, (2) publish a catalog/brochure documenting that exhibition, and (3) set up a series of lectures throughout the year featuring outstanding women artists from the Fresno region and beyond. The woman chosen each year must be a working artist and must have been working as an artist for 30 years or more.

For 29 years, the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100, remains a unique organization devoted to recognizing outstanding women in the arts. The Council, working in collaboration with the Museum, has garnered recognition for its valuable contribution of honoring [[contemporary women artists]].

Since the spring of 1988, this program has honored the following internationally recognized artists with the annual [[Distinguished Woman Artist Award]] and Exhibition:

1988 – [[June Wayne]]
1989 – [[Helen Lundeberg]]
1990 – [[Ruth Weisberg]]

'''''Haytarma''''' is a 2013 Ukrainian [[period drama]] film. It portrays Crimean Tatar [[test pilot]] and [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] [[Amet-khan Sultan]] against the background of the 1944 [[deportation of the Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref name="FilmOffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmoffice.org.ua/2012/10/production-news-haytarma/|title=Production news: Haytarma|publisher=Ukraine Film Office|date=2012-10-05|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the film means "Return".&lt;ref name="QHA20130330"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qha.com.ua/haytarma-movie-preview-appears-124387en.html|title=Haytarma movie preview appears|work=QHA Crimean News Agency|date=2013-03-30|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and release==
Production of the film began in October 2012 in [[Crimea]]. The initial budget for the film was US$2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FilmOffice"/&gt; The funds were provided by Lenur İslâm, owner of [[television in Ukraine|Ukrainian television station]] [[ATR Channel]]. Much expenditure was devoted to [[scenic design]] and [[costume design]].&lt;ref name="QHA20130515"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qha.com.ua/haytarma-is-film-for-crimean-tatars-126275en.html|title=Haytarma is film for Crimean Tatars|work=QHA Crimean News Agency|date=2013-05-15|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preview of the film was released on March 2013.&lt;ref name="QHA20130330"/&gt; The [[premiere]] was scheduled for 18 May 2013, the 69th anniversary of the deportations; Sultan's granddaughter, [[Soviet Air Force]] pilots, and ambassadors of foreign countries were invited to attend.&lt;ref name="QHA20130515"/&gt;

==Reactions==
The ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' gave a positive review, describing ''Haytarma'' as a "must-see for history enthusiasts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/movies/haytarma-the-first-crimean-tatar-movie-is-a-must-see-for-history-enthusiasts-326698.html|title='Haytarma', the first Crimean Tatar movie, is a must-see for history enthusiasts|work=Kyiv Post|date=2013-07-08|accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Simferopol]], the Kosmos Cinema estimates that six thousand people saw the film in the first week, and one thousand per day by 4 June; the cinema had begun with just two screenings per day, but added two additional ones in response to the unexpected popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qha.com.ua/haytarma-movie-creates-stir-127136en.html|title=Haytarma movie creates stir|work=QHA Crimean News Agency|date=2013-06-04|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was screened at the [[International Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.habermonitor.com/en/haber/detay/haytarma-antalya-golden-orange-film-festival/183495/|title=Haytarma, Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival will be shown|work=Haber Monitor|date=2013-10-03|accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of three films which made the Ukraine Oscar selection committee's shortlist to be [[List of submissions to the 86th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|submitted as a nominee in the Best Foreign Language Film]] category at the [[86th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vz.ua/shou_biz/kino/rodnyanskii_khaitarma_mozhet_pretendovat_na_oskar|title=Роднянский: "Хайтарма" может претендовать на "Оскар"|trans-title=Ronyanskii: 'Haytarma' may qualify for Oscar|work=Vzglyad|date=2013-09-10|accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Consul in Simferopol Vladimir Andreyev provoked public controversy for his comments that the film "distorts the truth" with its failure to mention alleged [[collaborationism]] by Crimean Tatars during [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine]]. Members of the public took offence, and on 23 May 2013 about 300 people held a protest outside the consulate demanding that Andreyev be declared ''[[persona non grata]]'', while the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] described Andreyev's remarks as "inappropriate". Andreyev initially stood by his remarks and refused to retract them, but the following day the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] also described Andreyev's words as inappropriate and incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130523/181312132-print/Crimean-Tatars-Rally-to-Expel-Russian-Consul.html|title=Crimean Tatars Rally to Expel Russian Consul|work=RIA Novosti|date=2013-05-23|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rianovosti.com/russia/20130524/181317658.html|title=Russia Admits Crimea Consul's Words Were 'Incorrect'|work=RIA Novosti|date=2013-05-24|accessdate=2013-06-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131023145924/http://rianovosti.com/russia/20130524/181317658.html|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illyrian amber figures''' are a group of small human and animal figures made out of amber. They were made from the start of the [[Iron Age]] around [[1000BC]] and their production continued down through the millennium. They  are found in nearly all of [[Illyria]] from [[Slovenia]] in the north to [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in the south. The sites with the most figures found are Ripac in [[Bosnia]] (15 figures in total of animals and humans) and Ormozh in Slovenia (10 human and 13 animal figures). The purpose of these figures is still a mystery and they could as well have been Illyrian deities, figures to represent the cult of the dead or simply children's toys. Amber was a plastic that Illyrians were very fond of and many of their jewellery and decorative objects were made of amber. For these figures it is hard to say that they are artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inpress''''' was a free weekly [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized music magazine ([[street press]]) that was published in [[Melbourne]],&lt;ref name=sbel&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah Bella|title=Drum Media, Inpress and Time Off to be Rebranded|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/drum-media-inpress-time-off-to-be-rebranded/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Music Feeds|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appd&gt;{{cite web|title=Inpress magazine|url=http://www.appdata.com/uapps/ios/2580401-inpress-magazine|work=AppData|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released in the [[Geelong]] and [[Mornington Peninsula]] areas of [[Victoria, Australia]]. The magazine was published by [[Street Press Australia]]&lt;ref name=appd/&gt; on a weekly basis every Wednesday.

The magazine comprised three main sections: All music news, features and reviews fall under the ''Inpress'' banner, arts and film is covered by ''Interval'', and the central section is [[dance music]]/[[urban music]] and [[Nightclub|nightclubbing]] magazine ''Zebra'', which is also distributed separately from ''Inpress''. The editors of the paper were Andrew Mast (Managing Editor), Shane O'Donohue (Editor), Kris Swales (''Zebra'' Editor) and Daniel Crichton-Rouse (''Interval'' Editor). [[Myf Warhurst]] is a former editor.

''Inpress'' also frequently published 'special features', such as their yearly [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] guide. 

''Inpress'' contained many popular features, including local cartoonist and musician [[Fred Negro]]'s  weekly cult comic strip, ''Pub''. Other notable features within ''Inpress'' included ''Finish Line'' (industry news column), Sugarfoot's ''SoDa Pop'' (pop gossip/news column - a differently named version of which had previously appeared in ''Beat Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beat|url=http://www.beat.com.au/|work=Beat|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until early 2004; [[Jeff Jenkins]]' ''Howzat!'' (indie rock and pop news), [[Clem Bastow]]'s ''Singled Out'' (singles reviews column) and [[Anthony Carew]]'s (some would say) notorious film reviews column in ''Interval'', ''Film Carew''. 

in 2006, Interests associated with ''Inpress'' publishers Craig and Leigh Treweek bought the influential [[Sydney]] street press ''[[Drum Media]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monika Lackmann|title=Sydney’s Drum Media Bought By Melbourne’s Inpress Magazine|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/aust/3967/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Faster Louder|date=8 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Treweek said at the time that "This is a great opportunity to build a strong music media outlet that is supportive of the local music scene at a grass roots level."

In August 2013 ''Inpress'' and other two magazines of the company, ''Drum Media'' and ''[[Time Off]]'', were merged under a new title, ''The Music''.&lt;ref name=sbel/&gt;

Salaries for the highest Bengali paid film actors currently range from {{INRConvert|30|l}} to {{INRConvert|40|l}}, but an actor can earn substantially more by deferring all or part of their salary against a percentage of the film's gross, known within the industry as a "profit participation" deal. Since not all salaries are made public. The figures are given at their [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal value]], since earnings from profit based deals are accumulated over many years, making it unfeasible to adjust for [[inflation]].

'''Military art''' is art with a [[military]] subject matter, regardless of its style or medium.  The battle scene is one of the oldest types of art in developed civilizations, as rulers have always been keen to celebrate their victories and intimidate potential opponents. The depiction of other aspects of warfare, especially the suffering of casualties and civilians, has taken much longer to develop.  As well as portraits of military figures, depictions of anonymous soldiers away from the battlefield have been very common; since the introduction of [[military uniform]]s such works often concentrate on showing the variety of these.

Naval scenes are very common, and battle scenes and "ship portraits" are mostly considered as a branch of [[marine art]]; the development of other large types of military equipment such as [[warplane]]s and [[tank]]s has led to new types of work portraying these, either in action or at rest.  In 20th century wars official [[war artist]]s were retained to depict the military in action; despite artists now being very close to the action the battle scene is mostly left to popular graphic media and the cinema.  The term war art is sometimes used, mostly in relation to 20th century military art made during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/war-art "War art"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com, and the article by Richard Woodward on "Military artists" in the same work ([http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists penultimate paragraph]); note that the term does not appear at all in [[Grove Art Online]], or other large art reference works. As formal "wars" have largely vanished, "combat artist" seems to be replacing "war artist" in official use.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient world===
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Alexander Mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] (left) defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], c. 100BC]]

Art depicting military themes has existed throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battlefield Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette]] from the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]] (circa [[3500 BC|~3500]] to [[3000 BC]]) is incomplete, but shows prisoners being led away, and wild animals feasting on the dead. The [[Stele of the Vultures]], about 2,500 BC, is one of a number of [[Mesopotamian]] "victory [[stelae]]".  Also around 2,500 BC, the earliest known depiction of a city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the [[Nome (Egypt)#Upper Egypt|21st nome of Upper Egypt]], who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Strudwick (2005), p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2008), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC appears to have been inconclusive, reliefs erected by [[Ramesses II]] show him scattering his [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] opponents with his chariot.

Surviving [[Assyrian art]] mainly consists of large stone [[relief]]s showing detailed scenes of either military campaigns or hunting.  The ancient Greek [[Parthenon Marbles]] show lengthy parades of the city's volunteer [[cavalry]] force, and many [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] show scenes of combat.  In [[Han dynasty]] China, a famous stone relief of c. 150-170 AD from the [[Wu family shrines]] shows a battle between cavalry forces in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ancient Roman art]] the most elaborate [[Roman triumphal column]]s showed very long reliefs of military campaigns winding round the body of huge columns; among the most impressive are those of [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome.  The [[Alexander Mosaic]] is a large and dramatic battle scene showing [[Alexander the Great]] defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; it is a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], probably copying a lost painting.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[Hellenistic]] and Roman [[sarcophagi]] showed crowded scenes of combat, sometimes mythological (an [[amazonomachy]] is a term for a scene of battle between [[Amazons]] and [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]), and usually not relating to a particular battle; these were not necessarily used to bury people with military experience.  Such scenes had a great influence on Renaissance battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"&gt;Pepper, 1 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the Late Roman Empire the reverse of coins very often showed soldiers and carried an inscription praising 'our boys', no doubt in hope of delaying the next military revolt.

===Medieval===
{{wide image|Tapisserie de Bayeux 31109.jpg|20000px|The entire 70 metres (230 ft) long [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Individual images of each scene are at [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]]. (Swipe left or right.)|30%|right|}}

Christian art produced for the church generally avoided battle scenes, although a rare [[Late Antique]] motif shows Christ dressed as a victorious emperor in general's dress, having conquered the devil, in [[Christ treading on the beasts]] and other [[iconography|iconographies]].  The violent tastes of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] elite managed to add the [[Harrowing of Hell]], conceived as a raid on Satan's stronghold, led by Christ, to the standard group of scenes for a cycle on the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soldier saints]], shown in military dress, were extremely popular, as were images of the [[Archangel Michael]] stabbing Satan as a dragon with a cross with a spear-point at its base.  Some [[illuminated manuscript]]s illustrated the many battles in the [[Old Testament]].

Secular works produced for secular patrons often show military themes, for example in illuminated manuscript copies of histories like the 15th century [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)]], where most of the 112 miniatures show military scenes.  The ''[[Siege of the Castle of Love]]'', often found on Gothic [[ivory]] mirror-cases, showed knights attacking a castle defended by ladies, a metaphor from the literature of [[courtly love]].  The 11th century [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22470&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Xnib8Hg?url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/homepage/ |date=2012-02-18 }}, Bayeaux tapestry, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form, p. 4]; excerpt,"... it is an established fact that it recounts a military triumph: the conquest of England by William the Conqueror"; [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form], pp. 5-6; excerpt, "This large-scale textile work of the 11th century is, to our knowledge, the only one of its kind to have survived to the present day. The Tapestry is an almost contemporary visual record of the event it depicts, one of the most significant events of Medieval times. It tells of the beginnings of the Norman Conquest; the landing of Norman and French troops in England and the Battle of Hastings"&lt;/ref&gt; the only surviving example of a type of embroidered hanging with which rich [[Anglo-Saxons]] used to decorate their homes.  In [[Islamic art]] the battle scene, often from a fictional work of [[epic poetry]], was a frequent subject in [[Persian miniature]]s, and the high viewpoint they adopted made the scenes more easily comprehensible than many Western images.

===Renaissance to Napoleonic Wars===
[[File:Urs Graf Schrecken des Kriegs 1521.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Battle of Marignano]], drawing by [[Urs Graf]], 1521]]

[[Italian Renaissance painting]] saw a great increase in military art by the leading artists, '''battle paintings''' often featuring near-contemporary scenes such as the huge set of three canvases of  ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1445) by [[Paolo Uccello]], and the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' (1504–06) by Michelangelo and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1503–06), which were intended to be placed opposite each other in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], but neither of which were completed.  For Renaissance artists with their new skills in depicting the human figure, battle scenes allowed them to demonstrate all their skills in depicting complicated poses; Michelangelo choose a moment when a group of soldiers was surprised bathing, and almost all the figures are nude.  Leonardo's battle was a cavalry one, the central section of which was very widely seen before being destroyed, and hugely influential: it "exerted a fundamental change on the whole idea of battle painting, an influence that lasted through the Late Renaissance and the Baroque up until the heroic machines of the Napoleonic painters and even the battle compositions of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]", according to the art historian [[Frederick Hartt]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 457 on Leonardo (quoted), 470-471 on Michelangelo, 246-248 on Uccello.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these depicted frankly minor actions where Florence had defeated neighbouring cities, but important battles from distant history were equally popular. [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' shows the [[Roman triumph]]al parade of [[Julius Caesar]], though concentrating on the booty rather than the army following it; the print series ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' shows both, leading up to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] riding on a huge carriage. ''[[The Battle of the Milvian Bridge (Giulio Romano)|The Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'' by [[Giulio Romano]] brought a huge and "seminal" battle scene into the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"/&gt;  The unusual ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1528–9) by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] managed to make one of the most highly regarded Renaissance battle scenes, despite, or perhaps because of, having a vertical format, which was dictated by the planned setting; it was commissioned as one of a set of eight battle paintings by various artists. "It was the most detailed and panoramic battle picture of its day",&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;  and its aerial viewpoint was to be very widely followed over the next centuries, though rarely to such dramatic effect.
[[Image:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|''Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602'', 1617, by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]]]]

Especially in Northern Europe, small groups of soldiers became a popular subject for paintings and especially [[old master print|prints]] by many artists, including [[Urs Graf]], who is unusual in that he was a professional [[Swiss mercenary]] for many years.  These works began to present a less heroic view of soldiers, who often represented a considerable threat to civilian populations even in peacetime, though the extravagant costumes of the [[Landsknecht]] are often treated as glamorous.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 1 (iii), Kettering, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  For Peter Paret, from the Renaissance "the glorification of the temporal leader and of his political system - which had of course also been present in medieval art - replaces the Christian faith as a determining interpretive force" in military art.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval painting became conventionalized in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], and from then on artists tended to specialize in it or not attempt it; apart from anything else "Marine artists have always dealt with a particularly demanding class of patron", as [[JMW Turner]] found when the "Sailor King" [[William IV of England]] rejected his version of ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]'' because of inaccuracy. [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]] was the earliest real specialist,  followed by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son team of Willem van de Velde]], who emigrated to London in 1673, and effectively founded the English tradition of naval painting, "producing a stunning visual record of the Anglo-Dutch naval wars, which set the conventions of maritime battle painting for the next 150 years".  Vroom had also worked for English patrons, designing a large set of tapestries of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] which was destroyed when the [[Houses of Parliament]] burnt down in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i) quoted on patrons; 2 (ii) quoted on van de Veldes; Slive, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th and 18th centuries saw depictions of battles mostly adopting a [[bird's eye view]], as though from a hill nearby; this made them less interesting to paint, and the major artists now tended to avoid them. A very different view of warfare is seen in ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' ("The Misfortunes of War"), a set of twelve [[etching]]s produced by [[Jacques Callot]] during the [[Thirty Years War]] which follows a group of soldiers ravaging the countryside before eventually being rounded up by their own side and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 155-156; [http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the first half of the 17th century, a branch of [[genre painting]] in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] specialized in [[guardroom scene]]s of rather disorderly soldiers, not often in battle, but ransacking farmhouses or sitting around in a camp guardroom.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i); Kettering, 104-109&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings of [[Salvator Rosa]], essentially [[landscape art|landscapes]], often showed groups variously described as bandits or soldiers lurking in the countryside of Southern Italy.  ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (1634–35) shows a crowded scene as the two sides meet peacefully to surrender the town; a theme more often copied in naval painting than land-based military art.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;
[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', 1784, by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]

During the 17th century sets of [[tapestries]] became the main medium for "official military art".  A set produced for the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] showing his victories was varied for different clients, and even sold to one of his opponents, [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], after reworking the general's faces and other details.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-succession/battle-blenheim.htm 1704 Battle of Blenheim depicted in tapestry at Blenheim Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-18th century, a number of artists, especially in Britain, sought to revive military art with large works centred on a heroic incident that would once again bring the genre to the fore in [[history painting]], as it had been in the Renaissance.  The standard contemporary battle scene tended to be grouped in the lowly category of [[topographical painting]], covering maps and views of country houses.  ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771) by [[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook]]'' (1779) by [[Johann Zoffany]], ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782]]'' and  ''[[The Death of Major Pierson]]'' (1784) by [[John Singleton Copley]] are leading examples of the new type, which ignored complaints about the unsuitability of modern dress for heroic subjects.  However such works had more immediate influence in France than in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Officer of the Imperial Horse Guards Charging.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Charging Chasseur]] by [[Théodore Géricault|Géricault]].]]

In the [[Napoleonic era]], France added [[Romanticism]] to its style and began to portray individual soldiers with more character.  Battle paintings were increasingly produced for large public buildings, and grew larger than ever before. [[Antoine-Jean Gros|Baron Gros]] painted mostly glorifications of Napoleon and his victories, but his 1808 painting of the ''[[Battle of Eylau]]'' does not neglect the suffering of the dead and wounded on the frozen battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine. (1977). "Gros, Baron Antoine Jean", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|''Nineteenth-century Painters and Painting: A Dictionary'', p. 100.|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Goya]]'s large paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', perhaps consciously conceived as a riposte to Gros, and his related series of 82 [[etching]]s, ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (Spanish: ''Los Desastres de la Guerra''), emphasized the brutality of the French forces during the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (ii); Honour &amp; Fleming, 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Goya y Lucientes, Franciso José de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 99.|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British depictions of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] continued the late 18th century patterns, often on a larger scale, with the death of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] quickly producing large works by [[Arthur William Devis]] (''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'') and West (''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]''). [[J. M. W. Turner]] was among the artists who produced scenes of Nelson's victories, with ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Institution]] ran competitions for sketches of art commemorating British victories, the winning entries being then commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 14-28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grande Armée - 10th Regiment of Hussars.jpg|thumb|upright|left|10th Regiment of Hussars, by Carle Vernet]]
In this period the uniform print, concentrating on a detailed depiction of the uniform of one or more standing figures, typically hand-coloured, also became very popular across Europe. Like other prints these were typically published in book form, but also sold individually.  In Britain the 87 prints of ''The Loyal Volunteers of London'' (1797–98) by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], mark the start of the classic period.  Though Rowlandson usually satirized his subjects to some degree, here the soldiers were "represented as they, and particularly their colonels who paid for their uniforms, preferred to see themselves", which remained the usual depiction in such prints.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 73-74, quoting Ford's history of the Ackermann firm.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[commons:Category:La Grande Armée (Carle Vernet)|set of prints]] by [[Carle Vernet]] of the splendid uniforms of ''La [[Grande Armée]] de 1812'' showed most foot-soldiers in pairs in camp, in a variety of relaxed poses that showed one from the front and the other from behind.  A rare oil painting by a leading artist that treats soldiers in the spirit of the uniform print is ''Soldiers of the 10th Light Dragoons'' (the "Prince of Wales Own") painted in 1793 by [[George Stubbs]] for their [[Colonel in Chief]], the future [[George IV of England]].  Other paintings of single soldiers were more dramatic, like [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'' (c. 1812).

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:Than tapiobicskei utközet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|thumb|left|Battle scene at [[Tápióbicske]] by [[Mór Than]], 1849]]

[[Eugène Delacroix]], who also painted many smaller combat scenes, finished his ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' in 1824, showing a then notorious attack on Greek civilians by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[Greek War of Independence]], who are shown in an entirely negative light.  It had a more immediate impact on European art than Goya's ''Tres de Mayo'' (''The Third of May 1808'') of a few years earlier, which was apparently not even on display in the [[Prado Museum]] until some years later.  In contrast, Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' of 1830 showed fighting in a positive light, but not the "military" as it shows armed civilian revolutionaries of the [[July Revolution]], advancing against the unseen uniformed forces of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 487-488&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkish atrocities were to remain a recurrent theme in 19th-century painting, especially in former Ottoman territories escaped from the declining empire (often pre-rape scenes treated rather salaciously), and general anti-military sentiments, previously mostly found in prints, were also to emerge regularly in large oil paintings.

Military art remained popular during the remainder of the 19th century in most of Europe. French artists such as [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Messonier, Jean Louis Ernest", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 145.|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edouard Detaille]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Detaille, Jean Baptiste Edouard", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 73.|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Neuville, Alphonse Marie de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 159.|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; established military genre painting in the [[Paris Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A.E. (1958).

European artists in a generally [[Academic art|academic style]] who were well known as painters of battle scenes, still often of subjects from the Napoleonic Wars or older conflicts, included [[Albrecht Adam]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Albrecht, Adam", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 28.|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicaise de Keyser]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Keyser, Nicaise de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piotr Michałowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Michalowski, Piotr", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Charles Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Antoine Charles Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 211.|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Jean Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Emile Jean Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 212.|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Camphausen]] and [[Emil Hünten]].  The rise of [[nationalism]] promoted battle painting in countries such as Hungary (great attention paid to uniforms), Poland (huge forces) and the [[Czech Lands]]. [[Jan Matejko]]'s enormous ''[[Battle of Grunwald (painting)|Battle of Grunwald]]'' (1878) reflects [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slav]] sentiment, showing various [[Slav]] forces joining together to smash the power of the [[Teutonic Knights]].

The usage of the term "military art" has evolved since the middle of the 19th century.  In France, Charles Baudelaire discussed military art, and the impact on it of photography, in the Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, Peter (1997). {{Google books|iCyO0uVEzRUC|''Imagined Battles. Reflections of War in European Art'', p. 85.|page=85}}, citing [[Charles Baudelaire]]. (1992). "The [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859", ''Selected Writings on Art and Literature'', trans. P. E. Charvet, pp. 295, 297; excerpt, "In a section preceding the discussion of ''military art'' in his articles on the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859, Baudelaire discussed the advent of photography and its impact on art."&lt;/ref&gt;  A British critic of the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1861 observed that 
{{cquote|British painters have never fully grappled with ''military art'', they have only hovered around the edges, touching and trimming. -- [[William Michael Rossetti]]&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| pp. 68-69.|page=68}}; the term ''military art'' is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a [[neologism]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This perspective is also seen in ''[[Remnants of an Army]]'' which showed William Brydon struggling into Jalalabad on a dying horse.

The British market began to develop in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| p. 71.|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relations between the state and its military, and the ideologies which are implied in that relationship affected the artwork, the artists and the public perceptions of both artwork and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ|p. 2-3.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Crimean War]] photographers began to compete strongly with artists in coverage of scenes in camp, and the aftermath of battle, but exposure times were generally too long to enable them to take pictures of battles very effectively. [[War photography]] is not covered in this article.  Illustrations for newspapers and magazines continued a heroic style with perhaps more confidence than painters, and [[Melton Prior]] followed British forces around Imperial troublespots for decades, working for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''; his scenes "helped to establish a style of action draughtsmanship which has left an indelible stamp on the art of the [[comic strip]]."&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"&gt;Pepper, 3, (ii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior and other "special correspondents" such as [[Frederic Villiers]] were known as "specials". [[Richard Caton Woodville]] and [[Charles Edwin Fripp]] were "specials" and also painters who exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"/&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[File:'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', etching and aquatint by Otto Dix, 1924.jpg|thumb|''[[Stormtrooper]]s Advancing Under Gas'', etching and aquatint by [[Otto Dix]] from ''Der Krieg'', 1924]]
World War I very largely confirmed the end of the glorification of war in art, which had been in decline since the end of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction and 3, ii&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, and despite the establishment of large schemes employing official [[war artist]]s, the most striking art depicting the war is that emphasizing its horror. Official war artists were appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives|National Archives (UK)]], [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm  "'The Art of War,' Learn About the Art."]&lt;/ref&gt; but many artists fought as normal soldiers and recorded their experiences at the time and later, including the Germans [[George Grosz]] and [[Otto Dix]], who had both fought on the Western Front, and continued to depict the subject for the rest of their careers. Dix's ''[[The Trench (Dix)|The Trench]]'' (1923), showing the dismembered bodies of the dead after an assault, caused a scandal, and was first displayed behind a curtain, before causing the dismissal of the museum director who had planned to buy it.  Later, after exhibiting it in their 1937 travelling exhibition of "[[Degenerate art]]", the [[Nazi]] government burnt it.  He produced a set of fifty prints in 1924 on ''Der Krieg'' ("The War").  The English artist [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] began to make drawings of the war while fighting on the Western Front in the [[Artists Rifles]].  After recovering from a wound he was recruited as an official war artist and produced many of the most memorable images from the British side of both World Wars.  After the war, the huge demand for [[war memorial]]s caused a boom for sculptors, covered below, and makers of [[stained-glass]].

[[Poster]]s had become universal by 1914 and were addressed at both the military and the "home front" for various purposes, including recruitment, where the British ''[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]'' (not actually the slogan) was repeated in the United States with [[Uncle Sam]], and elsewhere with similar totemic figures.  The Soviet Union began with very [[Modernist]] posters such as ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' by [[Lazar Markovich Lissitzky]] but soon turned to [[socialist realism]], used for most [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union]], which sometimes are similar to their [[Art of the Third Reich|Nazi equivalents]].  In World War II they were even more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;James covers all major combatant nations of World War I; for British World War II posters, and a wider bibliography, see ''Weapons on the Wall'' in external links&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrators and sketch artists such as Norman Rockwell also followed the trend away from military themed shots following the Second World War and with the rise of photographic covers in general.

The impact of the [[Spanish Civil War]] on a non-combatant populace was depicted in [[Picasso]]'s masterpiece, [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']], showing the [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, William. [http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm The Lessons of Guernica,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012027/http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm |date=2010-12-04 }} ''Toronto Star.'' February 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a very different treatment of a similar subject is seen in [[Henry Moore]]'s drawings of sleeping civilians sheltering from [[The Blitz]] bombing on the station platforms of the [[London Underground]]. Among official World War II war artists, Paul Nash's ''[[Totes Meer]]'' is a powerful image of a scrapyard of shot-down German aircraft, and the landscapist [[Eric Ravilious]] produced some very fine paintings before being shot down and killed in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Ardizzone]]'s pictures concentrated entirely on soldiers relaxing or performing routine duties, and were praised by many soldiers: "He is the only person who has caught the atmosphere of this war" felt [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], the art critic and historian, friend of Picasso, and then in a military medical unit.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Photography and film were now able to capture fast-moving action, and can fairly be said to have produced most of memorable images recording combat in the war, and certainly subsequent conflicts like the [[Vietnam War]], which was more notable for specifically anti-war protest art, in posters and the work of artists like [[Nancy Spero]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 77-83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

===Portraiture===
[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration]] of the [[Peace of Münster]]'', 1648, by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], 232 × 547 cm (91.34 × 215.35 in)]]
Rulers have been shown in specifically military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in [[Ancient Roman sculpture]], where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic.  Medieval [[tomb effigies]] more often than not depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service.  In the [[Early Modern period]], when senior commanders tended to wear their normal riding dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the buff leather jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again,&lt;ref&gt;Kettering, 100&lt;/ref&gt; although initially officer's uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.

Full-length and equestrian portraits of rulers and [[general officer|generals]] often showed them on the battlefield, but with the action in the distant background; a feature probably dating back to [[Titian]]'s magisterial ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'', which shows the emperor after his victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] but with no other soldiers present.  Monarchs were not often painted in military uniform until the Napoleonic period, but in the 19th century this became typical for formal portraits, perhaps because uniform was more visually appealing. A distinctively Dutch type of painting are huge group portraits commissioned by the wealthy part-time officers of city militia companies, of which [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is much the most famous, although its narrative setting is atypical of the genre.  Most examples just show the officers lined up as though about to eat dinner, and some show them actually eating it.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise group portraits of officers are rather surprisingly rare until the 19th century.

===Sculpture===
[[File:Jagger artillery memorial1.jpg|thumb|right|One of the figures on the [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in London, by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]]]] 
[[File:Fischerskulptur aus Stgw 57 IMG 1477.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture made from Swiss assault rifles [[SIG SG 510|Stgw 57]]]]
Most surviving sculpture of battle scenes from antiquity is in stone reliefs, covered above.  Renaissance artists and patrons were keen to revive this form, which they mostly did in much smaller scenes in stone or bronze.  The tomb in [[Milan]] of the brilliant French general [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours]] included numerous marble reliefs round the base of the sarcophagus (which was never completed).  Statues and tomb monuments of commanders continued to be the most common site until the more general [[war memorial]] commemorating all the dead began to emerge in the period of the Napoleonic Wars. [[Nelson's Column]] in London still commemorates a single commander; it has very large reliefs around the base by different artists, although these are generally regarded as less memorable than other aspects of the monument. [[Wellington's Column]] in [[Liverpool]] is also known as the "Waterloo Memorial", shifting to the more modern concept when "the dead were remembered essentially as soldiers who fought in the name of national collectives".&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge losses of the [[American Civil War]] saw the first really large group of sculptural war memorials, as well as many monuments for individuals.  Among the most artistically outstanding is the Memorial to [[Robert Gould Shaw]] and the all-[[African American|black]] [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Regiment]] by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] in Boston, with a second cast in the [[National Gallery of Art, Washington]].  The even larger losses of World War I led even small communities in most nations involved to raise some form of memorial, introducing the widespread use of the form to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the sudden increase in demand leading to a boom for sculptors of [[public art]].  Even more than in painting, the war brought a crisis in style, as much public opinion felt the traditional heroic styles inappropriate.  One of the most successful British memorials is the starkly realist [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in London, the masterpiece of [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]], who had been wounded three times in the war and spent most of the next decade commemorating it.  In the defeated nations of Germany and Austria controversy, which had a political aspect, was especially fierce, and a number of memorials considered excessively modern were removed by the Nazis, whose own memorials, such as the [[Tannenberg Memorial]] were removed after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions were to make memorials more neutral, as in the repurposed [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin, since rededicated to different groups several times, and the dignified architectural forms of the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph in London]] (widely imitated) and the German [[Laboe Naval Memorial]]; tombs of the [[Unknown Warrior]] and [[eternal flame]]s were other ways of avoiding controversy.  Some, like the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|Canadian National War Memorial]], and most French memorials, were content to update traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of World War I memorials were simply expanded in scope to cover the dead of World War II, and often subsequent conflicts. The now dominant role of [[photography]] in depicting war is reflected in the [[National Iwo Jima Memorial]], which recreates the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.  The [[National D-Day Memorial]], a project of the 1990s, includes strongly realist sculpture, in contrast to the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington.  More innovative memorials have often been erected for the civilian victims of war, above all those of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, throughout. His Chapter 1 gives an overview of the study of 19th and 20th century memorials&lt;/ref&gt;

The thematic range embraces the causes, course and consequences of conflict.&lt;ref name="iwm_about"/&gt;

War art, a significant expression of any culture and its significant legacies, combines artistic and documentary functions to provide a pictorial portrayal of war scenes and show "how war shapes lives."&lt;!--sent ends here --&gt;&lt;ref name="iwm_about"&gt;[[Imperial War Museum]] (IWM), [http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.604 About the Imperial War Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205040456/http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.604 |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura.

(2010) [http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7876/2/Gough_Introduction_A_Terrible_Beauty.pdf ''A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War,'' p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the tussle includes determining how best to illustrate complex war scenes. [[Charles Bean|C.E.W. Bean]]'s ''Anzac Book'', for example, influenced Australian artists who grew up between the two world wars.  When they were asked to depict a second multi-nation war after 1939, there was a precedent and format for them to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John B. (1977). ''Australian Artists at War,'' Vol. 2, p. 5; excerpt, "The Australian people first became familiar with Australasian ''war art'' as a genre with the publication of the so-called 'Christmas books' ... which contained the writings of servicemen and were illustrated by the current war artists."&lt;/ref&gt;

War art has been used as an instrument of propaganda, such as a nation-building function or other persuasive ends.&lt;ref name="foss157"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 6.|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; War art is also captured in caricature, which offers contemporary insights.&lt;ref&gt;ASKB, [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/collections/askb/caricatures.php Caricature]&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Civilization and aesthetic tradition were both clearly marked by military conflicts throughout history.

====War artists====
[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier - The Portrait of a Sergeant - WGA14740.jpg|thumb|Artist portraying a sergeant (1874), by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]].]]
War artists may be involved as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel who respond to powerful inner urges to depict direct war experience, or individuals who are officially commissioned to be present and record military activity.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ro8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LJ9YTPu0AY689QT9xLnsBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Oxford Companion to Military History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of nation's efforts to document war events, [[Japanese official war artists|official Japanese war artists]] were commissioned to create artwork in the context of a specific war for the Japanese government, including ''sensō sakusen kirokuga'' ("war campaign documentary painting"). Between 1937 and 1945, approximately 200 pictures depicting Japan's military campaigns were created.  These pictures were presented at large-scale exhibitions during the war years; After the end of World War II, Americans took possession of Japanese artwork.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Barbara. (2005).  ''Artists of World War II'', pp. 111-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsuruya_aas"&gt;Tsuruya, Mayu.

There are some who may choose not to create war art. During the course of World War II, the Italians created virtually no art which documented the conflict.  The French began to paint the war only after the war was ended in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alan. (1983). ''Colours of War,'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sign .jpg|thumb|300x300px]]
The '''Millay Colony for the Arts''' is an arts community offering residency-retreats and workshops in [[Austerlitz, New York]], and free arts programs in local public schools. Housed on the former property of [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning feminist/activist poet and playwright [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], the Colony's campus offers artists, students, and art lovers residencies, retreats, and classes.


==History==
[[File:MillayColonyBarn.jpg|thumb]] In 1925, Edna St. Vincent Millay bought ''[[Steepletop]]'', a house with a blueberry farm in Austerlitz, NY, named after a pink, conical [[wildflower]] that grows there.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', May 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With her husband, Millay built a barn from a [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] kit, and then a writing cabin, and a tennis court.  

After the poet's death in 1950, her sister [[Norma Millay Ellis]] moved to Steepletop. In 1973, she founded The Millay Colony, which was established as a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Millay Farm Becoming an Arts Colony," The New York Times, February 20, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Norma Millay Ellis donated the barn and surrounding acreage to The Millay Colony. The barn was subsequently renovated to provide accommodations and studio space for four resident artists. 

In the mid-1990s, The Millay Colony commissioned architectural firm [http://www.michaelsinger.com/project/millay-colony-for-the-arts/ Michael Singer Studio], in consultation with an advisory committee of six artists with disabilities, to design an additional building for the Colony using the principles of universal access and environmentally friendly design.&lt;ref&gt;"An Artists' Retreat Is Extending Its Welcome," New York Times, October 3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This 3,550 square foot building currently houses The Millay Colony's offices and public rooms, and provides accommodations and studio space for three additional artists, for a total capacity of seven. 

The Colony is adjacent to [[Steepletop]], Edna St. Vincent Millay's former home and gardens, which today are maintained by the [http://www.millay.org/ Millay Society] (established as a nonprofit in 1972). The Millay Society also holds rights to the poet's intellectual property and operates as a separate organization from The Millay Colony. The house and gardens are a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==Arts Education==
The Millay Colony offers Workshop Retreats, formulated and taught by artists with a commitment to teaching. These affordable, multi-day classes, held on The Millay Colony's campus, invite artists at all stages of their career to develop new work while engaging with other artists.

Concurrently, the Colony offers a multiform program of arts education to more than 500 public school children in four local school districts each year, as well as professional development/teacher training on using the arts across disciplines for local teachers.

==Residencies==
The Millay Colony offers residencies to emerging and established visual artists, writers, and composers—individually and in collaborating groups – from April to November. These artists and groups receive private bedrooms and private studios as well as all meals and access to the Colony's libraries, darkroom, music room and the natural resources on the campus adjacent Harvey Mountain State Forest.

October 1 is the date to apply for residencies in April to July of the following year.  

March 1 is the date to apply for residencies in August to November of the same year. 

All residencies are reviewed anonymously by juries of artists, critics and curators.  The Colony hosts over 60 residents per year.

'''Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA)'''  ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Nasjonal digital læringsarena'') is a joint [[Counties of Norway|county]] enterprise offering open [[digital learning assets]] for [[Upper secondary school (Norway)|upper secondary education]]. In addition to being a compilation of [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]], NDLA provides a range of other online tools for sharing and cooperation. The legal liability for the joint county programme is carried by [[Hordaland County Municipality|Hordaland County Council]].

NDLA does not take on its own employees, but manages co-workers within the county resource system, as well as co-workers from [[private sector]].
Core activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.&lt;ref&gt;From Chapter 2 in NDLAs Annual Report for 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006 The [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/andre/brev/utvalgte_brev/2006/digitale-laremidler-i-videregaende-oppla.html?id=91754 Letter from the Ministry of Education dated 19.06.2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1998-07-17-61#KAPITTEL_3 Norwegian Education Act § 3-1. The right to upper secondary education for youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA).&lt;ref&gt;"Digitale læremiddel i vidaregåande opplæring - Nasjonal digital læringsarena", political issue with case number 200702708-9 in Hordaland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ Norwegian Digital Learning Arena opened by PM Jens Stoltenberg. (From the web site of Hordaland County.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052740/http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.

The 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Many curricula cover more than one subject; it is for example normal that a curriculum for a vocational syllabus is split into three or four different subject areas. Curricula for Norwegian, mathematics, and English also cover more than one subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.

In 2013 [[Akershus]] County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akershus.no/file/ec32575da10d58b6582107d0d4343d8c/Sakskart%202%20til%20fylkestinget%2023.09.13.pdf Agenda from the Akershus County Assembly of 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by [[Google Analytics]] the figures are:&lt;ref&gt;Figures of ratings quoted from [http://om.ndla.no/brukerstatistikk/ NDLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010: 1 431 017
* 2011: 2 876 541
* 2012: 4 799 181
* 2013: 7 022 812
* 2014: 8 200 000
* 2015 10 000 000
* 2016: 11 800 000
* 2017: 12 400 000 

[[Oslo]] County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.

==External evaluations==
The NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.&lt;ref&gt;Athenae AS [http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerundersøkelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf Evaluation of NDLA -- User Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022222111/http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerunders%C3%B8kelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement and Production==
By publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.

The responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.

When the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.

==Funding==
The basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 7 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 8 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 NDLA was indicted by the [[Norwegian Publishers' Association]] before the [[European System of Financial Supervisors|European Surveillance Authority]] (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf Annual Report from Norwegian Publishers' Association 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105033/http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment was initially rejected by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] on 12 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2011-10-12: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1535 State aid: Norwegian support to provider of digital learning material cleared] 12.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftasurv.int/media/decisions/311-11-COL.pdf EFTA Surveillance Authority decision] 2011-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the [[EFTA Court]] announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2013-03-27: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1905 State Aid: Investigation opened into funding of Norwegian provider of digital learning material]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2014-06-26: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/2278 State aid: Norwegian support to the provider of digital learning material does not involve state aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Open catalogue''' is an [[open content]] catalogue or [[free content]] catalogue, a structured database with information about products or other stored items in a standardized format. A catalogue implies [[categorization]] or classification of the items involved, and [[database normalization]] to increase the usability of the catalogue for searching &amp; finding, and comparing items within the same category on their main attributes. 

The term was first used by Dr. Martijn Hoogeveen of the [[Open University (Netherlands)]] for the [[Open ICEcat]] project, which resulted in an open catalogue for product information, often used by merchants as input for their [[mail-order catalogue]]. A DTD for  the [[Open Catalog Exchange Format]] is developed by Sergey Shvets and Dimitry Mitko.

'''Opera Ireland''' was Ireland's first permanent national opera company. Although its roots go back to 1941 as the '''Dublin Grand Opera Society''', the company was established in its final form in 1985 as the Dublin Grand Opera Society Ltd. From 1996 until its demise in 2010 it was known as Opera Ireland. During its existence it was based at Dublin's [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]].&lt;ref name = "Randel"&gt;Randel, Don Michael (2003). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&amp;pg=PA421 "Ireland"]. ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p. 421. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674011635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

The Dublin Grand Opera Society (DGOS) was founded in 1941 by Captain (later Colonel) William O'Kelly and a group of opera enthusiasts with [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]] as its patron. The shows were cast with local singers and a volunteer chorus. Initially the music was provided by the orchestra of the [[Irish Army]] music school, and later by the [[RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra|Radio Eireann Symphony Orchestra]]. The Society put on two one-week seasons of opera throughout the years of World War II. After the war ended the DGOS presented performances by European opera companies such as the [[Opera-Comique]], [[Hamburg Opera]] and the [[Netherlands Opera]]. From the mid 1950s to 1966, the Society, concentrated on Italian opera with the help of sponsorship from the Italian government. During that time numerous Italian stars and rising stars of the day appeared there, including [[Luciano Pavarotti]] who sang in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[La traviata]]'', and ''[[La bohème]]''. The Italian sponsorship ended in 1966, but the [[Arts Council of Ireland]] and the [[Bord Fáilte]] (Ireland's tourist board) continued to provide guarantees for any financial losses. New opera companies were brought in, including the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera]] and the [[Prague National Theatre]].&lt;ref name = "Brennan"&gt;Brennan, Paddy  (May 2016). [http://classicalartsireland.com/archive-project/ "DGOS/Opera Ireland. A forgotten legacy?"]. ''Classical Arts Ireland''. Retrieved 5 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Development and demise==
In the mid-1980s, after a particularly shambolic production of ''[[Tosca]]'', the DGOS came under pressure from the Arts Council to move towards mounting its own productions and spending more on sets and costumes. The Society was reconstituted as a [[private company limited by guarantee]] in 1985 and began the transition from an amateur society to a fully-fledged professional company, taking on its first permanent staff—an Administrator, Artistic Director and Chorus Master.  The volunteer amateur chorus was given a professional "core" through a contract with the [[National Chamber Choir of Ireland]]. The British theatre and opera director Michael McCaffery was appointed the company's first Artistic Director in 1986 and the company continued presenting two one-week seasons each year with two productions each season.&lt;ref name = "Dervan1"&gt;Dervan, Michael (19 November 2010). [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/final-curtain-for-opera-ireland-1.678844 "Final curtain for Opera Ireland"]. ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Retrieved 5 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brennan" /&gt;

According to Michael Dervan, the music critic of ''[[The Irish Times]]'', under Michael McCaffery, there were immediate and major improvements in production values. However, McCaffery resigned in 1989 without completing his full contract. His successor, Kenneth Richardson, lasted for only two seasons. Richardson was followed by [[Elaine Padmore]] who at the time was also the Artistic Director of the [[Wexford Festival]]. When she departed in 1993 to become Artistic Director of the [[Royal Danish Opera]], Dorothea Glatt took over. Glatt combined her post at DGOS with her ongoing work as the assistant to [[Wolfgang Wagner]] at the [[Bayreuth Festival]]. Her tenure was not a particularly successful one and in 1996 the company advertised once again for a new Artistic Director. That same year it also officially re-branded itself as Opera Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Dervan, Michael (11 April 1996). [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/back-at-the-crossroads-1.38872 "Back at the crossroads"]. ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Retrieved 5 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Randel" /&gt; 

Opera Ireland ceased operation in 2010. The plan of the Arts Council of Ireland was to create the Irish National Opera. However, the new company never became operational and the project was eventually shut down. The project was restarted in 2017 with the formation of a new Irish National Opera to be formed under from the merger of Opera Theatre Company and Wide Open Opera with Fergus Sheil as artistic director. The Irish National Opera officially launched in January 2018 with a production of Thomas Adès's chamber opera ''[[Powder Her Face]]'' with plans to present and tour six more operas by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Dervan, Michael (3 July 2017).

'''Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments''' ('''SPACES''' or '''SPACES Archives''') is a non-profit public benefit organization created with an international focus on the study, documentation, and preservation of art environments (or [[visionary environments]]) and self-taught, publicly-accessible artistic activity (see [[self-taught art]]). Currently based in [[Aptos, California]], SPACES boasts an archive of approximately 35,000 photographs as well as hundreds of books, articles, audio and video tapes/DVDs, and artists’ documents. SPACES has become recognized internationally as the largest and most complete archive on this subject.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/about/|title=What is SPACES?|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/arts/preserving-our-art-spaces.aspx|title=Preserving Our Art Spaces|work=Utne|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050501/news_1a01spaces.html|title=Seymour Rosen, the champion of 'folk art environments' - The San Diego Union-Tribune|work=utsandiego.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPACES maintains an online index of more than 1,400 art environments around the world, exhibiting its collection of images, documents, and writings, and also providing further reading on the artists and their built environments.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"/&gt; The organization also provides resources and best practices on the preservation of threatened sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/resources/preservation-toolbox/|title=Saving and Preserving Toolbox|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, SPACES announced a partnership with the [[Kohler Foundation]] to transfer SPACES’ archives and the operation of the website to the only foundation in the country dedicated to the preservation of art environments. The Kohler Foundation, which is the philanthropic organization founded by the [[Kohler family of Wisconsin]], has committed extensive resources to the present and future of SPACES' mission and archives for "generations to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/blog/2017/06/07/spaces-inc-moving-to-wisconsins-kohler-foundation-inc/|title=SPACES, Inc.

== History ==
SPACES was organized in 1969 and then formally Incorporated in 1978 by Founding Director [[Seymour Rosen]], a Los Angeles photographer who became interested in the aesthetic genre of art environments after photographing [[Watts Towers]]. His images of this iconic artwork – including those of the infamous 1959 "stress-test" that proved the Towers’ stability – resulted in Rosen's first major solo photographic exhibition at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1962, titled [http://www.lacma.org/simon-rodia’s-towers-watts-photographic-exhibition-seymour-rosen ''Simon Rodia's Towers in Watts''].&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacesarchives.org/about/seymour-rosen/seymour-rosen-bio/|title=Seymour Rosen - Biography|author=TOKY Branding + Design|work=spacesarchives.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacma.org/simon-rodia’s-towers-watts-photographic-exhibition-seymour-rosen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/articles/seymour-rosen-and-spaces|title=Seymour Rosen and SPACES|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen also authored the 1979 book ''In Celebration of Ourselves''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/about/further-reading|title=Further Reading|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SeymourRosenandJoFarbHernandez.jpg|thumb|SPACES Founder Seymour Rosen with Jo Farb Hernádez in 1999 at Watts Towers. Photo by Sam Hernádez.]] --&gt;

As the founder of the SPACES organization, Rosen was invited to serve on the board of directors of [[Raw Vision]] with its inception, and from its first issue in 1989 contributed often to its pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawvision.com/shop/raw-vision-123|title=Raw Vision #1,2,3|work=rawvision.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 he was honored by the Folk Art Society of America with their Award of Distinction for his “pioneering work in the field of environmental documentation and preservation.”.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkart.org/about/awards-of-distinction|title=Awards of Distinction and National Folk Art Sites|work=folkart.org|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This included advocacy such as successfully designating sites for the California State Landmark registry, including [[Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village]] in Simi Valley and [[Nitt Witt Ridge]] in Cambria.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/25/local/me-rosen25|title=Seymour Rosen, 71; Documented Folk Art Pieces|work=latimes|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/san-luis-obispo/nitt-witt-ridge-arthur-harold-beal.html|title=Nitt Witt Ridge: Cambria's Folk Art Hearst Castle|author=Sarah Linn|work=KCET|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noehill.com/napa/cal0939.asp|title=California Landmark 939: Litto's Hubcap Ranch in Napa County|author=Alvis Hendley|work=noehill.com|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | [These sites] defy categorization, and that fact has resulted in an ongoing battle to get institutions to recognize the value of documenting and preserving these forms of expression. Collecting the material has been, of necessity, a labor of love…. But I am told that perhaps the time has come; perhaps a varied and complete record of the most ephemeral events of the American spirit and heritage can finally be assembled for us all to share. Maybe we will even be able to preserve the environments and objects so that people can see them firsthand. SPACES is an attempt to move in that direction, to acknowledge the magic made available to us by those whose work looks best outside of institutional walls—with the hope that we all will take the time to do our own explorations.&lt;ref name="tokybranding+design"/&gt;

'''shinkansen''' (1989-2004) was an East London sound and movement research, development and production unit focusing on body technology integration by facilitating connectivity between [[dance]], [[performance]], [[music]], [[Video art|video]] and digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodydataspace.net/shinkansen/aboutus.htm|title=A Brief History|website=shinkansen|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shinkansen collective developed an early [[Practice research|practice-led research]] model, taking artist-led innovation into the mainstream. It conceived and produced projects in the United Kingdom and internationally, integrating artists, creatives and technologists from a diverse range of cultural and specialist backgrounds by developing early European networks of performing artists and digital creatives. shinkansen initiated early experiences of interdisciplinary creation, with and alongside interactive digital tools, and was experimenting with early concepts of [[telepresence]].

The collective annually delivered curations at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London and for [[Dance Umbrella]], produced, lead commissions and directed workshops, laboratories and residences, all focussed on the integration of dance and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodydataspace.net/shinkansen/keyachievements.htm|title=Key Achievements|website=shinkansen|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of shinkansen was acquisitioned by the [[British Library]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/target/32899285/collection/26312782/source/collection|title=The shinkansen Collection (website)|website=UK Web Archive|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive includes over 800 documentation tapes of performances, installations and debates, held at the British Library as ''The shinkansen Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodydataspace.net/connectivity/britishlibrary.html|title=British Library|website=The shinkansen Collection|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

shinkansen was a partnership between Ghislaine Boddington and Debbi Lander who co-owned the company from 1991 - 2004. After shinkansen produced the landmark turntable piece, Vinyl Requiem (1993) it became a revenue funded organisation of Arts Council England. In 1994 shinkansen left East London and moved to Bloomsbury in the West End.The multimodal poet, performance writer, and professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, chris cheek is one of the co-founders.

'''Social design''' is design, that is mindful of the designer’s role and responsibility in society; and the use of the design process to bring about social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Social_Design_(MA)/Overview.html|title=Overview {{!}} MICA|last=Art|first=Maryland Institute College of|website=www.mica.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social design is also a critical discipline that challenges the pure market-orientedness of conventional design practice, and attempts to see past, into a more inclusive conception of design, in which user groups who are marginalized are also given priority. 

==Responsibility==
Within the design world, social design is sometimes defined as a design process that contributes to improving human well-being and livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda of social design is inspired by among others' [[Victor Papanek]]’s idea that designers and creative professionals have a [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and are able to cause real change in the world through good design. Papanek writes about responsible design. Designers can contribute to designing more [[ecological]] products by carefully selecting the materials they use. Papanek also remarks on designing for people's needs rather than their wants. Responsible design includes many directions and one of these is design for the [[Third World]]. Designers have responsibility over the choices they make in design processes.&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, Victor (1984): Design for the Real World. Academy Chicago Publishers. Completely Revised Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Social design thinking within the design world joins developing human and [[social capital]] with new products and processes that are [[Profit (economics)|profitable]]. Profitability and [[ownership]] of the processes are the cornerstones of [[sustainability]] that underpins human well-being{{according to whom|date=January 2017}}. Another author that contributes to the development of this definition of social design is [[Victor Margolin]]. He writes in "''The Politics of the Artificial''" about the "designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being." This [[ideology]] is something that social design is built on.&lt;ref&gt;Margolin, Victor (2002): The Politics of the Artificial. Essays on Design and Design Studies. The University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London&lt;/ref&gt; In this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help etc. It is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local [[economic development]] or livelihood. At the same time Social Design also challenges the conventional market model of designing. While traditionally, Design has been approached as a profession that remains strictly answerable to market forces, Social design envisages the possibility of a more distributive conception of surpluses, by ensuring that the benefits of services and systems reach a wider range of user groups who may often fall outside the market system.

==Strategic thinking==
Another starting point for outlining social design is [[strategic thinking]] of design. Creating policies and implementing them on a civil level. The two poles: tradition and the market economy can, in one of the models for social design, be placed in [[interaction]], rather than in competition, with each other. An author that has to be mentioned here is [[Jacque Fresco]] and his Venus Project. He proposes that the future of the social systems needs to be designed by the [http://plaesturb.org/index.php?title=P%C3%A1gina_Principal scientific method]. Social design can then be seen as a process that leads to human capabilities that in turn contributes to their well-being. As [[Amartya Sen]] writes, [[poverty]] is seen as deprivation of capabilities. By focusing on capabilities, rather than e.g. income, Amartya Sen suggests that development within various social aspects of life can contribute to general development. Understanding and using social design processes can contribute to the improvement of livelihood&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya (2000): Development as Freedom. Anchor Books. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance design==

{{importance section|date=January 2017}}

As social media becomes integrated with live performance, social design has become a term to describe someone who designs how online tools connect to a performance. Just as there are lighting designers, sound designers, set designers, costume designers and video designers - social designers work with a team to complement a production with social media tools and content.  In this context, social design is defined as: "The strategic implementation of social media to deepen or broaden the nature of an artistic performance."

==Designing systems==
Another dimension of social design focuses on designing systems that join the elements of [[communication]], [[new product development]] and the [[Social environment|environment]]. It is argued that no single area of design is, by itself, sufficient to drive sustainable social development. What is needed is a system of design, one that encompasses all of the areas of design, towards an open system with multiple, self-adjusting and complementary actors that aim for a vision of a loosely defined common set of goals.

Outside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments. There are a growing number of artists, especially in Scandinavia, that use the term social design to describe their work, though the work is exhibited within the art world. These are artist like FOS and [[Superflex]]. They come out of a tradition of social art that can be led back to the Futurists, the Dadaists and e.g. the German artist [[Joseph Beuys]]. In the realm of practice, however, Social design can be rooted more specifically in developing world contexts, within unequal spaces, where design is not merely an attempt at serving the few, but many simultaneously. This approach is particularly taken in the MDes Program in Social Design in Ambedkar University, Delhi, India. 

==Social world==
The term social design is also increasingly used to describe design of the social world. This definition implicates a perception of a man-made reality, which consequently can only be changed by humans, and ''is'' changed by humans all the time. In this view social design is inescapable, it is there whether people are aware of it or not. The social reality is created as a result of the sum of all our individual actions. There is an emerging discussion of this concept of social design, which encompasses all other definitions of the term. 

==Initiatives==
* The [http://www.micasocialdesign.com Center for Social Design], at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), is dedicated to demonstrating the value of design in addressing complex social problems and to preparing the next generation of creative changemakers.

The '''''Stormy Sea in Étretat''''' is an 1883 painting by one of the founders of French [[Impressionism]], [[Claude Monet]]. The painting is now preserved at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].

The painting depicts a stormy sea on a winter day. The cliff in the background is at [[Étretat]] ([[Seine Maritime]]); Monet frequently stayed in the area during the winter of 1864-65, and wrote: "I spend my time outdoors on the stone when it's big time [...] and of course I work all the time." Monet composed the painting in February 1883 from his hotel window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Vagues, autour des paysages de mer de Gustave Courbet |first= Annette |last=Haudiquet |year=2004 |url= http://expositions.bnf.fr/lamer/arret/index523.htm |publisher=Expositions BNF |language=French |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the painting was bought by the Parisian dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], and then became the property of the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon in 1902. The museum was a forerunner in the collecting of early 20th century Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'impressionnisme de France et d'Amérique : Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Degas |url= http://museefabre.fr/pdf.php/?filePath=var/storage/original/application/5d47f081e7a5fe3ca22f31ae07432d89.pdf |publisher=Musée Fabre |format=pdf |page=13 |language=French |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is composed of four major elements, each painted in a different way. The central part is invaded by the pearlized surfs painted in forms of [[comma]]s. In the foreground, a small beach on which there are old boats filled with thatch on the left, and two fishermen with their boats in poor condition that ran aground on the shore. On the left, in the background, the [[cliff]] of Étretat can be seen and the rock strata are evoked by horizontal lines of brush. Finally, the upper part of the painting shows the sky, painted in a way that expresses a curtain of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Claude Monet (Paris, 1840 – Giverny, 1926), ''Mer agitée à Étretat'' |url=http://www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/oeuvres-peintures/xixe_siecle/etretat_mer_agitee?from_url=http%3A//www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/departement4598&amp;b_start:int=44&amp;startingReq=/sections/fr/collections-musee/peintures/oeuvres-peintures/#res_recherche |publisher=Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon |language=French |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sunflowers''''' (original title, in French: '''''Tournesols''''') is the name of two [[serial imagery|series]] of [[still life]] paintings by the Dutch painter [[Vincent van Gogh]]. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, executed a year later in [[Arles]], shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend [[Paul Gauguin]], who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with ''Sunflowers'', now part of the painted ''[[Décoration for the Yellow House]]'' that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the ''Berceuse Triptych'', and finally he included them in his [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit]].

== The Paris ''Sunflowers'' ==
{{See also|Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)}}
Little is known of Van Gogh's activities during the two years he lived with his brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted ''Sunflowers'' already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: "I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent me from Brittany,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wildenstein&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time giving me back both my portrait&lt;ref&gt;Selfportrait ''à l'ami Gauguin''&lt;/ref&gt; and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I've told you just how matters stand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/571.htm|title=Letter 571 - Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 17 January 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ''Sunflowers'' in question show two buttons each; one of them was preceded by a small study, and a fourth large canvas combines both compositions.

These were Van Gogh's first paintings with ''"nothing but sunflowers"''—yet, he had already included sunflowers in still life and landscape earlier.

== The Arles ''Sunflowers'' ==
In a letter to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], dating from 21 or 22 August 1888, Vincent wrote: "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating [[bouillabaisse]], which won’t surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers." At this time he had three paintings on the go, and intended to do more; as he explained to his brother: "in the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin, I'd like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large sunflowers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let666/letter.html Letter 666] To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 21 or Wednesday, 22 August 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving aside the first two versions, all Arlesian ''Sunflowers'' are painted on [[French standard sizes for oil paintings|size 30 canvases]].

=== The initial versions, August 1888 ===
None meets the descriptions supplied by van Gogh himself in his announcement of the series in every detail. The first version differs in size, is painted on a size 20 canvas—not on a size 15 canvas as indicated&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt;—and all the others differ in the number of flowers depicted from van Gogh's announcement. The second was evidently enlarged and the initial composition altered by insertion of the two flowers lying in the foreground, center and right.&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 344–348&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the third nor the fourth shows the dozen or 14 flowers indicated by the artist, but more—fifteen or sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 337–340; 340–343 and Van Tilborgh &amp; Hendricks, pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
These alterations are executed ''wet-in-wet'' and therefore considered genuine rework—even the more so as they are copied to the ''repetitions'' of January 1889; there is no longer a trace of later alterations, at least in this aspect.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Both ''repetitions'' of the 4th version are no longer in their original state. In the Amsterdam version a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, [[Émile Schuffenecker]].&lt;ref&gt;See Dorn 1999, pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and it has been suggested that this version may have been the work of [[Émile Schuffenecker]] or of [[Paul Gauguin]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Bruce."[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1357627/Van-Goghs-25m-Sunflowers-is-a-copy-by-Gauguin.html Van Gogh's £25m Sunflowers is 'a copy by Gauguin']". ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 September 2001.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Sunflowers Berceuse triptych - letter.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the triptych in a letter to Theo]]
In January 1889, when Vincent had just finished the first repetitions of the ''Berceuse'' and the ''Sunflowers'' pendants, he told Theo: "I picture to myself these same canvases between those of the sunflowers, which would thus form torches or candelabra beside them, the same size, and so the whole would be composed of seven or nine canvases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/574.htm|title=Letter 574 – Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 28 January 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definite hint for the arrangement of the triptych is supplied by Van Gogh's sketch in a letter of July 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/592.htm|title=Letter 592 – Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 22 May 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Vincent selected both versions for his display at Les XX, 1890.

== Sunflowers, friendship and gratitude ==
[[File:Paul Gauguin - Vincent van Gogh painting sunflowers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Paul Gauguin: ''[[The Painter of Sunflowers]]'', 1888]]
Van Gogh began painting in late summer 1888 and continued into the following year. One went to decorate his friend [[Paul Gauguin]]'s bedroom. The paintings show sunflowers in all stages of life, from full bloom to withering. The paintings were considered innovative for their use of the yellow spectrum, partly because newly invented [[pigment]]s made new colours possible.

In a letter to Theo,&lt;ref&gt;Letter [http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/573.htm 573]&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It's a type of painting that changes its aspect a little, which grows in richness the more you look at it. Besides, you know that Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He said to me about them, among other things:
‘that — ... that's... the flower’. You know that [[Georges Jeannin|Jeannin]] has the peony, [[Ernest Quost|Quost]] has the hollyhock, but I have the sunflower, in a way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let741/letter.html Letter 741] To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 22 January 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 30, 1987, Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto paid the equivalent of US $39,921,750 for van Gogh's ''Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers'' at auction at [[Christie's]] London, at the time a [[List of most expensive paintings|record-setting amount for a work of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clines |first=Francis X. |title= Van Gogh Sets Auction Record: $39.9 million |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1987-03-31 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB1F3DF932A05750C0A961948260 |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price was over four times the previous record of about $12{{nbsp}}million paid for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' in 1985. The record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another Van Gogh, ''[[Irises (painting)|Irises]]'', by [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] for $53.9{{nbsp}}million at [[Sotheby's]], New York on November 11, 1987.

While it is uncertain whether Yasuo Goto bought the painting himself or on behalf of his company, the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Japan, the painting currently resides at Seiji Togo Yasuda Memorial Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. After the purchase, a controversy arose whether this is a genuine van Gogh or an [[Émile Schuffenecker]] forgery.

=== Provenances ===
Two Paris versions van Gogh exchanged with Gauguin in December 1887 or January 1888, were both sold to [[Ambroise Vollard]]: one in January 1895 and the other in April 1896.  The first canvas resided for a short time with Félix Roux, but was reacquired by [[Vollard]] and sold to [[Degas]], then from his estate to Rosenberg, then to Hahnloser and bequested to the [[Kunstmuseum Bern]]. The second was acquired by the Dutch collector Hoogendijk at the sale of his collection by Kann, who ceded the painting to Richard Bühler and then via Thannhauser to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

Two of van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' paintings never left the artist's estate: the study for one of the Paris versions (F377) and the repetition of fourth version (F458). Both are in the possession of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established 1962 by Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist's nephew, and on permanent loan to the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam.

Five other versions are recorded in the Van Gogh estate papers:&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1999 and Stolwijk &amp; Veenenbos 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*the final Paris version (F.452) in the artist's estate was sold 1909 via C. M. van Gogh, [[The Hague]] (J. H. de Bois) to Kröller-Müller
*(F457) sold 1894 to [[Émile Schuffenecker]]. (Tokyo version).
*(F456) sold 1905 via [[Paul Cassirer]] to [[Hugo von Tschudi]]. (Munich version).
*(F459) sold 1908 C. M. van Gogh (J. H. de Bois), The Hague to Fritz Meyer-Fierz, Zürich (destroyed Japan 1945).
*(F454) sold 1924 via Ernest Brown &amp; Phillips (The [[Leicester Galleries]]) to the [[Tate Gallery]]; since on permanent loan to the [[National Gallery]], London. (London version).

Two Arles versions left the artist's estate unrecorded:
*(F453) (private collection). Sold 1891 to Octave Mirbeau, Paris, (via Tanguy, Paris) for £12 (about £1,300 in 2013 £). Sold 1996 to a private collector for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 2013, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
*(F455) (Philadelphia version).

'''''The March of the Guards to Finchley''''', also known as '''''The March to Finchley''''' or '''''The March of the Guards''''', is a 1750 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by English artist [[William Hogarth]], owned by and on display at the [[Foundling Museum]]. Hogarth was well known for his satirical works, and ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' has been said to have given full scope to this sense of satire; it was described by Hogarth himself as "steeped in humour".&lt;ref name="hog"&gt;Hogarth, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is a depiction of a fictional mustering of troops on the [[Tottenham Court Road]] to march north to [[Finchley]] to defend the capital from the second [[Jacobite rebellion of 1745]], which was part of a series of uprisings that had been occurring since the late 17th century and were aimed at returning the [[Stuart Dynasty]] to the throne after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott, p.455&lt;/ref&gt; It portrays the soldiers in a humorous light, placing exaggerated emphasis on their lack of training and respect for discipline.

''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' was originally intended to be a gift to the incumbent King of England, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. However, George II was insulted by the apparent jab at his best troops, and rejected it when it was offered to him. Upset at the King's spurning of his work, Hogarth opted to change the engraving and present the painting instead to the King of [[Prussia]], [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], who, being known for his skills as a soldier rather than an artist, was reportedly much more satisfied with the gift.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Prince Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Edward Stuart]] was the remaining member in the [[House of Stuart]], the line of descendants of [[James II of England|James II]], in 1745, when he headed the [[Second Jacobite Rebellion]].]]
The Jacobite risings were a series of rebellions affecting all of the British Isles except for [[Wales]] and that occurred between 1688 and 1746, four years before the painting of ''March of the Guards to Finchley''. Centred on attempts by Jacobites to restore [[James II of England|James II]] and his descendants, the [[House of Stuart]], to the throne, there were two major uprisings, referred to as the "First" and "Second" "Jacobite Rebellions" respectively, the first having taken place in 1715 and the second thirty years later in 1745.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; This painting shows a fictional incident during the second rising.

The "'45" was the product of the disappointment of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], the exiled Jacobite [[pretender]], with the French's unwillingness to invade England to restore the [[House of Stuart]] to power. In 1744, Charles decided to finance the military and social costs of an uprising, believing that he would be able to take the kingdom. With the support of various Scottish [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] clans, Stuart was initially successful. The rebels defeated government forces at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], and captured [[Edinburgh]]. The Stuart army invaded England, passing through [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and reaching [[Derby]] on 4 December. However, promised support from France failed to arrive, and, in the absence of an English popular uprising, Charles assented to the demand of his Council of War to return to Scotland. Eventually, the Stuart army was comprehensively defeated at [[Culloden Moor]] on 16 April 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/features_union_jacobites.shtml|title=Jacobites and the Union|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Gate of Calais]]]]
Hogarth completed ''March of the Guards to Finchley'' in 1750. The work was initially meant as a gift to George II, and a print was sent before the release of the painting to the Royal Palace for his approval. However, George II had been expecting an artwork that honoured his most favoured guards, not mocked them – accounts state he was offended by what he considered an insult on Hogarth's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The following dialogue is said to have taken place between George II and the deliverer of the portrait, the Earl of Harrington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1836|title=Tales of the Wars; Or, Naval and Military Chronicle|publisher=W.M. Clark|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the painting was taken to the King for inspection:
:"Pray, who is this Hogarth?"
:"A painter, my liege."
:"I hate painting and poetry too! Neither the one nor the other ever did any good!"
:"The picture, please your majesty, must undoubtedly be considered as a burlesque!"
:"What? A painter burlesque a soldier? He deserves to be [[picket (punishment)|picket]]ed  for his insolence! Take this trumpery out of my sight."
Soon thereafter, the painting was returned to Hogarth, who was reportedly mortified by the King's response to what he considered to be one of his finest works. Hogarth later modified the inscription to read "the King of Prussia", rather than "the King of England", before presenting the work to Frederick II of Prussia, who met the work with more enthusiasm and acknowledgement of its artistry.&lt;ref name="Clerk"&gt;Clerk, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick II was certainly no expert on the arts, and he was more known on the battlefield; some have speculated that this explains his positive reception to a work depicting the English military in poor form.&lt;ref name="Mag" /&gt;

The patriotism of the painting provides a satirical counterpoint to Hogarth's overt antipathy to the French, evident in his painting ''[[The Gate of Calais]]'', completed in 1748. Hogarth's later dedication of ''March'' to the King of Prussia further enforces this view; Frederick II was a renowned military strategist, but not an art connoisseur.&lt;ref name="Mag"&gt;Coleridge, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the picture may have been inspired by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]]'s ''Départ de Garnison''.

An [[engraving|engraved]] version, by Hogarth's assistant, [[Luke Sullivan]],&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; was published shortly after the painting was completed, though Hogarth made further alterations to the engraving ten years later. The engraving was unusual in that it was not a reversed image of the original painting. Hogarth priced the published artwork for a price of seven shillings and sixpence each copy, rising to half a Guinea after the subscription closed. In advertisements for the painting, Hogarth referred to a subscription-based extra whereby buyers who deposited another three shillings on top of the seven and sixpence would be considered in a lottery for the ownership of the original copy, which would be delivered to the winning subscriber after the engraving had been finished. Hogarth's engraving of ''A Stand of Arms, Musical Instruments, Etc.'' served as the subscription and lottery ticket. As noted by Hogarth in the 1 May 1750 edition of ''The General Advertiser'', this subscription offer ended on 30 April 1750. At the day of closure, there were 1843 chances sold and 167 chances still remaining in Hogarth's lottery, and he gave this remainder to the [[Foundling Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anecdotes of Painting in England|year=1849|pages=735|publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; an establishment to which he had, in the past, been a lucrative donor.&lt;ref name="Clerk" /&gt; Holding almost 10% of the tickets, the Hospital won the lottery and the original; Hogarth scholar Ronald Paulson considers the lottery was rigged from the start. Today the painting is owned by and on display at the [[Foundling Museum]].

===Analysis===
The painting depicts a scene on [[Tottenham Court Road]], a bustling street on the north side of London. The King's guard have rendezvoused there on their way to Scotland to engage the rebels, and numerous soldiers are caught amongst the crowd. Orderly lines of soldiers march away in the distance; meanwhile, a disarrayed, misshapen mass of soldiers engaging in a range of unbecoming behaviours crowds the foreground.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; Paradoxically, the work both highlights the dissolute and disreputable nature of the guardsmen and shows that they can be transformed into a disciplined fighting force, with the drummer and boy fifer summoning the soldiers to their duty.
[[File:MOTGTFDetail1.png|left|thumb|A drunken soldier rejects water in favour of more alcohol]]
In the approximate centre of the piece, two women apparently quarrel fiercely over the [[courtship]] of a [[grenadier]]. The woman to his right, a pregnant ballad-seller, carries a basket full of copies of "[[God Save the King]]", while the older woman to his left, dressed in dark priest's robes with a [[crucifix]] swinging around the neck, holds a rolled Jacobite newspaper above her head.&lt;ref&gt;Branham, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have seen Hogarth's incorporation of the "God Save the King" text to represent public support for the Crown: English musician and author [[Percy Scholes]] said the painting symbolises the nation "wavering between the Hanoverian Protestant Succession and Stuart Romanist Succession", with "God Save the King" "thoroughly associated with the former."&lt;ref&gt;Branham, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the three, another soldier and a [[milkmaid]] are caught in a passionate embrace. A drummer standing to the left is similarly the centre of feminine attention – perhaps his wife and child; behind, a man urinates against the tavern wall, pained by his [[venereal infection]].&lt;ref name=McNeil122 /&gt; Further to the right, near the edge of the painting, a drunken soldier has collapsed to the ground from his own intoxication; despite his state, he rejects the water his comrade behind him is offering him, and instead reaches for another measure of [[gin]] from the woman to his left. Soldiers directly behind him – one of whom clenches an upturned knife – are robbing the civilians.&lt;ref name=McNeil122&gt;McNeil, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, a hungry guard gladly takes food from the platter of a [[pie]]man. To the left-hand-side of the middleground, a boxing match between two soldiers is underway, with an eager group of spectators onlooking.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; Across the street, numerous prostitutes holler down to the men from open windows of [[Mother Douglas]]'s house, as do soldiers to their cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;Réveil, p.983&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hogarth, several of the more prominent soldiers featured in the painting – such as the grenadier, the drummer and the drunkard – were based from models observed before the creation of the artwork. Notable in particular among these is Lord Albemarle Bertie, who was used as the model for the man seen standing with fists clenched behind the two boxers.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt;

=== Reception ===
Critics have likened the chaotic scene of ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' to the narrative of English satirist [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''. In his ''Hogarth's Literary Relationships'', Robert E. Moore states that the "elements" of comedy" in ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' are "the very essence of Fielding's comedy as well":&lt;ref name=McNeil122 /&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;At a first hasty glance the multiplicity of characters and action in ''Tom Jones'', once the story has taken to the road, suggests a chaos just like the wild disorder of the "March to Finchley" [...] the structure of ''Tom Jones'' is well-nigh perfect, one of the marvels of English fiction. Likewise, in the field of painting, there has seldom been a more ordered chaos than that of the "March to Finchley".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sly Old Cat''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Beatrix Potter]] in 1906, and first published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1971, almost thirty years after her death. The story tells of a cat who invites a rat to a tea party with the intention of eating him, but the rat outwits her and leaves the party with a muffin in a paper bag.

The story was written in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, and was intended to be published in 1907 as a panorama book, a long strip of paper with text and illustrations that folded into a wallet. Booksellers objected to the format, because the item was too difficult to keep folded and in its place once customers opened it for examination. The tale was set aside. In 1916, it was again considered for publication but, again, set aside. Potter's eyesight was failing and she did not want to become involved in the labour of developing a book for publication. It was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches. The book was critically well received.

==Plot==
A cat invites a rat to her tea party. She eats her bread and leaves only crumbs for the rat. She drinks her tea and leaves only drops of milk for the rat. The rat believes she will eat him for dessert and wishes he had not come. When the cat raises the milk jug to drink the last of the milk, the rat gives the jug a pat and it slips down over the cat's head. She bangs about the kitchen unable to free herself. The rat sips some tea, puts a muffin in a paper bag, and leaves. Later, he eats the muffin.

==Composition and publication==
Potter wrote the book in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, Nellie Warne. Publication was intended for 1907 as a companion piece to the panorama books, ''[[The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The Story of Miss Moppet]]'', but booksellers objected to the panorama format which was nothing more than a long paper strip of illustrations and text that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. It was difficult to keep such a book folded and enclosed in its wallet after curious customers opened it for examination. The story was set aside.&lt;ref name="Taylor130"&gt;Taylor 1987, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the story was again considered for publication but in the standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit library rather than the panorama format.&lt;ref name="Lear280"&gt;Lear 2007, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The title was announced on an [[endpaper]] as ''The Story of the Sly Old Cat'' but Potter's watercolours were never prepared for printing.  Her eyesight was failing and she did not look forward to the work involved in preparing the book for publication.  She suggested [[Ernest Aris]] for the job, but the book only reached a rough draft stage.  The story was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches.  The book is not included in the standard small format library of 23 Peter Rabbit books.&lt;ref name="MacDonald50"&gt;MacDonald 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentary==
''The Sly Old Cat'' is told mainly in monosyllables, and is critically considered "perfect in its fusion of word and picture, and visually reminiscent of [[Randolph Caldecott]] in its rythmic narrative flow."&lt;ref name="Taylor130"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

'''''Woman Ironing'''''&lt;ref&gt;Woman Ironing. Collections. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3417&lt;/ref&gt; (1904) is an oil painting by [[Pablo Picasso]] completed during the artist's [[Blue Period]] (1901—1904). This evocative image, painted in neutral tones of blue and gray, depicts an emaciated woman with hollowed eyes, sunken cheeks, and bent form, as she presses down on an iron with all her will. A recurrent subject matter for Picasso during this time is the desolation of social outsiders. This painting, as the rest of his works of the Blue Period, is inspired by his life in Spain but was painted in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Picasso's Blue Period - 1901 to 1904. Pablo Picasso - Paintings,Biography, Quotes of Pablo Picasso. http://www.pablopicasso.org/blue-period.jsp. Web Nov 21 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When Picasso painted ''Woman Ironing'' he was roughly 22 years old. Living in Paris, with little money, he would often start a painting on a canvas, abandon it, and later use the same surface to paint over a new work. Since 1989, when an infrared camera was used to examine Woman Ironing, art historians and conservators have been aware of the existence of another portrait beneath it. The work is part of the Thannhauser Collection&lt;ref&gt;Thannhauser Collection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/acquisitions/4&lt;/ref&gt; currently on display in the Thannhauser Gallery of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York.

== Background ==

Picasso's artistic training began as a youth in Spain where traditions of realism, including academic classicism and Spanish [[Genre art|genre]], influenced him in various degrees. His devotion to the [[Modernisme|Catalan modernism]] movement in Barcelona, as well as his encounter with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] and Symbolist painting in Paris, had an important, although brief, impact on his oeuvre. Between 1901 and 1904 Picasso moved back and forth between France and Spain, again the years of Picasso's Blue Period.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Mark, Robert J. Boardingham, Jeffrey Weiss. Curators' Preface. Marilyn McCully, Ed. Picasso--the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Woman Ironing'' was painted during a phase in his work that he developed once he settled in Paris in 1904. He was living in [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] building in [[Montmartre]] at 13 Rue Ravignan along with many other artists.

=== The studio ===

During his Blue period years, Picasso's group of friends widened, and he became particularly close with poets [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1880—1918) and [[André Salmon]] (1881—1969). Salmon's recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio provides us with glimpses of the artist's way of working:

{{Quote|text=A petrol lamp was burning on a table carved in bourgeois taste with Second Empire moldings, which [Picasso] had bought at a junk shop. there was no question of electricity or even gas at 13 [Rue Ravignan]. The petrol lamp gave out little light. In order to paint and to display his canvases, a candle was necessary—that guttering candle which Picasso held up high in front of me when he gave me a human introduction to the superhuman world of these starving people, these and mothers with no milk, the superreal world of bleue Misère.|author=André Salmon |source= Souvenirs sans fin,1955.170}}

Regardless of the lack of gas or electricity, Picasso favored working at night. Before 1909, most of his paintings were done under the light of an oil lamp, hung above his head while he squatted on the floor in front of his canvas. When he could not afford to buy the oil, which was quite often, he held a candle with one hand while working with the other.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Roland. Picasso: : His Life and Work. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==

[[Ambroise Vollard]], Paris; Der Neuer Kunstsalon, Munich; [[Thannhauser Galleries|Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser]], Munich, ca. 1913; Karl Adler, Berlin and Amsterdam, 1916; purchased from Adler by [[Justin K. Thannhauser|J.K. Thannhauser]], 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Drutt, Matthew. Thannhauser: The Thannhauser Collection of the Guggenheim Museum. New York, N.Y: Guggenheim Museum, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Woman Ironing'' dates from 1904, the year when Picasso had permanently moved to Paris after visiting the city several times. Picasso's relationship with [[Ambroise Vollard]] (1866—1939), the first owner of the painting, began in 1901 when at the age of nineteen, Picasso approached the already established Parisian art dealer. In 1901, Vollard gave Picasso his first show in Paris. It was not a great success in Vollard's eyes as many of the works sold at low prices. The dealer refused to buy the unsold pieces, and it was not until the artist's reputation grew that Vollard made several important purchases. Their relationship lasted until 1939, and Vollard never offered Picasso a secure contract.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, Rebecca A, Douglas W. Druick, and di P. M. Assante.

[[Justin K. Thannhauser]] (1892—1976), the last owner of the painting before he bequeathed it to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was a critical figure to the advancement of modern art in Europe. Justin assisted his father Heinrich Thannhauser in managing the distinguished Moderne Galerie, established in Munich in 1909. In 1913, the gallery mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective, which included ''Woman Ironing''.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Collections. Thannhauser Collection. http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/about-the-collection/new-york/thannhauser-collection/1647&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings and sculptures bequeathed by Justin K. Thannhauser to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1963 were on loan to the museum before permanently entering the collection in 1978, two years after Thannhauser's death.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Collections. Thannhauser Collection. About. http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/about-the-collection/new-york/thannhauser-collection&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

By using color and form to evoke notions about the subject of the work, Picasso depicts the laundress in neutral tones and in a tense, angular manner, expressing poverty, loneliness, and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Picasso decontextualizes the woman by removing her from a specific place and time and keeps her anonymous, using her tired female body, hardened by challenge and labor, to generalize human tragedy. These generalizations, visible in his [[Blue Period]] and [[Rose Period]] works, are testament of Picasso's preoccupation with the universal, more than with particular human events and emotions, including his own.&lt;ref&gt;Art of This Century: The Guggenheim Museum and Its Collection/ the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. New York, NY: Guggenheim Museum Publ, 1994. 72-73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso deals with the laundress' occupation as a universal symbol. The theme is not only one of social compassion, but one hinting at the circumstances of an urban proletariat, which is larger than the reality of a single laundress.&lt;ref&gt;Drutt, Matthew. Thannhauser: The Thannhauser Collection of the Guggenheim Museum. New York, N.Y: Guggenheim Museum, 2001. 64-66 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso is not the first to explore the theme of labor. During the late 19th and early 20th century, works such as Gustave Courbet's ''[[The Stonebreakers]]'' (1849) and Jean-Fraçois Millet's ''[[The Gleaners]]'' (1857)  depicted the hardships of workers, bringing their untold stories to the forefront.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Collection Online. Woman Ironing (La repasseuse). http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daumier]], [[Degas]], and Picasso himself in 1901 had previously explored the subject of the laundress. The expressive pose in Picasso's 1904's ''Woman Ironing'', was certainly inspired by Degas's ''Woman Ironing'' (ca. 1884—1886).&lt;ref&gt;Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Curiously, the same pose appears in [[The Blue Room (Picasso)|''The Blue Room'']], a 1901 Picasso painting. Idealized workers—portrayed as simple, strong souls that symbolized purity and virtue— were a large focus of Picasso's Blue Period.

While these social, economic, and political complexities formed Picasso's sympathies, perceptions, and expressions, many scholars argue that his apparent interest is less ideological than dramatic. One can quickly draw the link between the representation of the underclass depicted in his canvases with   [[Social Realism]]—a movement that criticized social structures maintaining the miserable conditions of the working class and the poor. But Picasso's relationship with his characters is a fictitious one, with little if any, Social Realism informing his vision of underclass life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Mark, Robert J. Boardingham, Jeffrey Weiss. Curators' Preface. Marilyn McCully, Ed. Picasso--the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

1904 was a transitional year between Blue and Rose periods. Picasso successfully attempts to reduce the heaviness found in sculptural figures painted in dark-valued monochromatic hues, by lightening color and elongating form. These developments point to his Rose period, during which he consciously works on the elegance of the figures.

''Woman Ironing'' encompasses some of these developments. His art relaxes, the figure elongates, as well as becoming more artificial in gesture, with more angular extremities. Soft shades of pinks, blues, and browns reintroduce color to the canvas. The drawing becomes looser, and the pigments are applied more openly, in a wash-like form. While the woman is carefully outlined, the drawing becomes more fluid; this is particularly noticeable in the linear patterns of the hair.&lt;ref&gt;Millard, Charles W. "Picasso Brujo." The Hudson Review. 34.1 (1981): 81. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model that Picasso uses for ''Woman Ironing'' has been identified as the daughter of Frédé, the owner of the café [[Lapin Agile|Le Lapin Agile]], frequented by Picasso and his friends. Her name is Margot, and she appears in his other canvases from 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Krens, Thomas, Germano Celant, and Lisa Dennison. From Van Gogh to Picasso, from Kandinsky to Pollock: Masterpieces of Modern Art : Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Thannhauser Collection. Milano: Bompiani, 1990. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imaging and discoveries ==
In 1989, a study of ''Woman Ironing'' revealed an apparent portrait of a man underneath the surface of the 1904 work of art. It is important to note that this is not the only Picasso painting that has a hidden image underneath its surface. For example, when asked to discuss ''Seated Woman and Child'', more than fifty years after its completion in 1901, it is reported that Picasso replied with a "touch of regret," mentioning a lost work that lay beneath it. "Maybe one could still see it if one radiographed the painting," he suggested.

Early in his career financial constraints were certainly part of his motivations for reusing canvases. Even though an artist has the option of scraping off an earlier work, or covering an old image with an even coat of ground to prepare the surface for the new painting, Picasso did this very rarely. Instead, he reworked his paintings directly over earlier images without eliminating the previous attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Hoenigswald, Ann. "Works in progress : Pablo Picasso's hidden images". Picasso, Pablo, Marilyn McCully, Ed.. Picasso--the Early Years, 1892-1906. Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservators and researchers can generally recognize anomalies in a painting by observing variation on its surface with the naked eye. To confirm that these variations are the product of an earlier image, a number of technical means to look beneath the visible image can be used. X-rays and infrared light can penetrate the layers of a painting to reveal paint changes and an artist's reworking that are normally hidden from view.

The [[infrared camera]] posed technological limitations that prevented further discoveries until recently. The need to revise the original restoration of the work conducted in the 1950s, as well as earlier imaging process and findings, led to an in-depth technical-scientific study&lt;ref&gt;Woman Ironing. Conservation. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/picassos-woman-ironing&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Woman Ironing''. Two types of infrared cameras, [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral]] and [[Multispectral imaging|multispectral]], were used for the recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Conservation Projects. TREATMENT AND IMAGING OF PICASSO'S "WOMAN IRONING". http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/picassos-woman-ironing&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the current methods allowed for a better view of the brushwork and contours of the man's portrait beneath ''Woman Ironing'', the resulting new infrared images do not provide accurate details of its painting palette. Up to now, microscopic analysis revealed that the true colors of the male portrait include rosy flesh tones and a bright red necktie. The outcome images of x-radiography are superior to those of infrared in areas of the composition containing white lead paint, therefore the x-ray of ''Woman Ironing'' captures best the characteristics of the brushstrokes in areas such as the man's face and sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Conservation Projects. TREATMENT AND IMAGING OF PICASSO'S "WOMAN IRONING" .http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/picassos-woman-ironing&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive reports on the findings of these extensive conservation and research efforts are set to be released in 2016.

== Influences on other artists ==

While it is difficult to deny the artistic genius of Pablo Picasso and his impact on the development of modern and contemporary art, it is also certain that most of his influence on other artist's works derives from later periods in his career.

''Woman Ironing'' directly inspired the work of artist [[Vik Muniz]] (1961—), a photographer and mixed-media artist, best known for repurposing everyday materials for intricate and heavily layered recreations of canonical artworks. His ''Woman Ironing (Isis)'',&lt;ref&gt;Muniz, Woman Ironing (Isis). Burger Collection http://www.burgercollection.org/welcome/artists/artist/contact1510.Muniz-Vik.html&lt;/ref&gt; from the series ''Pictures of Garbage'' (2008), is a homage to Picasso's painting. Muniz collaborated with a team of men and women who earned their living by collecting recyclable materials. A woman named Isis Rodrigues Garros, who had ended up working at the landfill, became the woman ironing. Muniz engaged with Picasso's painting by depicting contemporary urban laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Post-Picasso Contemporary Reactions, Museu Picasso http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/en/exhibitions/temporals/post-picasso/html/ambit4-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
