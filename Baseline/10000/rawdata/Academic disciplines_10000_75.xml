      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12401">In [[Electrical engineering|the design of electrical power systems]], the '''[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard device numbers'''  (ANSI /[[IEEE]] Standard C37.2 ''Standard for Electrical Power System Device Function Numbers, Acronyms, and Contact Designations '') identifies the features of a protective device such as a [[relay]] or [[circuit breaker]]. These types of devices protect electrical systems and components from damage when an unwanted event occurs, such as an [[Fault current|electrical fault]]. Device numbers are used to identify the functions of devices shown on a [[Schematic|schematic diagram]]. Function descriptions are given in the standard. 

One physical device may correspond to one function number, for example "29 Isolating Contactor", or a single physical device may have many function numbers associated with it, such as a numerical [[protective relay]]. Suffix and prefix letters may be added to further specify the purpose and function of a device. 

ANSI/IEEE C37.2-2008 is one of a continuing series of revisions of the standard, which originated in 1928 as [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] Standard No. 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tengdin|first1=John|title=Knowing the Language: The History and Practice of IEEE C37.2|url=http://www.elp.com/articles/powergrid_international/print/volume-14/issue-2/features/knowing-the-language-the-history-and-practice-of-ieee-c372.html|website=Electric Light &amp; Power|publisher=PennWell Corporation|accessdate=18 October 2017|date=1 February 2009|quote=It may surprise some to learn that this standard—or more accurately its AIEE predecessor—is one of the oldest IEEE standards in use. It was first published as AIEE No. 26 in 1928 and was used to document the control systems in the then popular automatic railway substations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffixes and prefixes ===
A suffix letter or number  may be used with the device number; for example, suffix N is used if the device is connected to a Neutral wire (example: 59N in a relay is used for protection against Neutral Displacement); and suffixes X,Y,Z are used for auxiliary devices. Similarly, the "G" suffix can denote a "ground", hence a "51G" is a time overcurrent ground relay. The "G" suffix can also mean "generator", hence an "87G" is a Generator Differential Protective Relay while an "87T" is a Transformer Differential Protective Relay. "F" can denote "field" on a generator or "fuse", as in the protective fuse for a pickup transformer. Suffix numbers are used to distinguish multiple "same" devices in the same equipment such as 51-1, 51–2.&lt;ref name="WEC"&gt;Applied Protective Relaying 1979 by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, 2nd Printing, "Appendix II, Electrical Power System Device Numbers and Functions" as adopted by IEEE standard and incorporated in American Standard C37.2-1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Device numbers may be combined if the device provides multiple functions, such as the Instantaneous / Time-delay Overcurrent relay denoted as 50/51.&lt;ref name="WEC" /&gt;

For device 16, the suffix letters further define the device: the first suffix letter is 'S' for serial or 'E' for Ethernet. The subsequent letters are: 'C' security processing function (e.g. VPN, encryption), 'F' firewall or message filter, 'M' network managed function, 'R' rotor, 'S' switch and 'T' telephone component. Thus a managed Ethernet switch would be 16ESM.

'''Apolista''' is a native [[South America]]n nation of western [[Bolivia]]. Sedentary farmers, hunters, gatherers and fishers, they spoke an [[Arawakan languages]] now [[List of endangered languages in South America|gravely endangered]], if not extinct. From 1713, they were gathered at a variety of missions with other nations, and rapidly lost their traditional culture to the point that a realistic census count is no longer possible.

The '''Association for Heritage Interpretation''' (AHI) is a membership based organisation for people actively involved or concerned with [[heritage interpretation]].

AHI began as the '''Society for the Interpretation of Britain’s Heritage''' in 1975 and later became the Association for Heritage Interpretation. It has a membership of over 400 interpreters from around the world. It is managed by an Executive Committee which meets four times a year and holds an AGM at the Annual Conference in the Autumn.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt; AHI’s president was [[John Edmondson, 2nd Baron Sandford|Lord Sandford]] (1920-2009){{cn|date=November 2016}} and its patron is Loyd Grossman.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt;

The Association states&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web|title=What is AHI?|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/about/what_is_ahi/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it:
{{quote| ... works to:

* Encourage excellence in interpretation 
* Promote professionalism in interpretation 
* Facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas 
* Support a wide range of organisations in their service to visitors 
* Develop and recognise best practice }}

AHI offers a focus for ideas, debate and networking. The association brings together people actively involved or concerned with interpretation of natural and cultural heritage. Some work as interpretation or heritage officers, park rangers or countryside managers, others as designers or illustrators, planners, teachers, curators, consultants, academics or people from many other professions with an interest in our environmental inheritance.

AHI publishes its journal ''Interpretation'' three times year, produces bi-monthly newsletters and organises a series of training events each year. In 2007, AHI worked with [[Interpret Scotland]] to hold [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]] in Aviemore. The vibrant annual AHI conference is hosted in different venues across Britain and brings together interpreters to meet each other, present papers on interpretation practice and visit local visitor sites to see case studies of interpretation. Recent hosts have included Bournemouth, Cardiff, Newcastle and Shropshire. The 2013 conference is in Edinburgh in October.

==Awards==
The AHI offered '''Discover Heritage Awards''' in 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Heritage Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 2007 the '''Interpret Britain and Ireland Awards''' were awarded annually, "recognising innovative and inspiring interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/view_details/4/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It is one of [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ten principle capabilities (see [[capabilities approach]]). She defines bodily integrity as: "Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including [[sexual assault]] ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex and Social Justice''. Oxford UP, 1999. 41–42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and law==

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an [[Unenumerated rights|unenumerated right]], protected by the general guarantee of "[[personal rights]]" contained within Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. In ''Ryan v Attorney General'' it was pronounced that ""you have the right not to have your body or [[personhood]] interfered with.

Judgement by Kenny J: "That the general guarantee of personal rights in section 3 (1) of Art. 40 extends to rights not specified in Art. 40.

=== United States ===
The [[United States Constitution]] does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to his or her physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld [[right to privacy]], which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining [[abortion]]s was protected by ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973). In ''[[McFall v. Shimp]]'' (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life.

Conversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting [[euthanasia]], laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, [[strip search]]es of prisoners, and forced [[Blood test|blood tests]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In general, the Canadian [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socscience.com/social-sciences/7327.html | title=琪琪布电影网}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic]] medication).

One unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the [[Ontario Health Care Consent Act]]. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to [[consent]] to medical treatment.  The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to ''understand'' and ''appreciate'' the information that is relevant to making such a decision.

== Human rights ==

Two key international documents protect these rights: the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

The Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, [[Slavery]] and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, [[Torture]] and Inhumane, [[cruel and unusual punishment |Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].

== Women's rights ==
Though bodily integrity is (according to the [[capabilities approach]]) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence.[citation needed] These include [[sexual assault]], unwanted pregnancy, [[domestic abuse]], and limited access to [[contraception]]. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: "bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them".

As defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women:
* [[Freedom of movement]]
* [[Security of person]]s
* [[Reproductive rights|Reproductive and sexual rights]]
* [[Women's health]]
* Breaking women's [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]]
* [[Education]]
* Networking&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Niamh. "Bodily Integrity and Security of Person." Women's Human Rights Campaign Ireland. 05 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://whr1998.tripod.com/documents/icclbodily.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's rights ==

''Researching Children's Rights to Integrity'' in ''Children's Childhoods: Observed And Experienced''. The Falmer Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the highly publicized [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Jerry Sandusky trial]],&lt;ref&gt;''

''I don't own my child's body''. CNN, 20 July 2015. &lt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/20/living/give-grandma-hug-child/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include:
* Allowing children to choose when to give hugs/kisses
* Encouraging children to communicate about [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]]
* Offer alternative actions (e.g. a [[high five]], handshake, etc.)

In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11055">A '''conserved name''' or '''''nomen conservandum''''' (plural '''''nomina conservanda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. cons.''''') is a scientific name that has specific nomenclatural protection. ''Nomen conservandum'' is a [[Latin]] term, meaning "a name to be conserved". The terms are often used interchangeably, such as by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|''International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants'']] (ICN),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants |edition=Melbourne Code |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' favours the term "''conserved name''".

The process for conserving botanical names is different from that for zoological names. Under the botanical code, names may also be "suppressed", '''''nomen rejiciendum''''' (plural '''''nomina rejicienda''''' or '''''nomina utique rejicienda''''', abbreviated as '''''nom. rej.'''''), or rejected in favour of a particular conserved name, and combinations based on a suppressed name are also listed as “''nom. rej.''”.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Botany ==
===Conservation===
In botanical nomenclature, '''conservation''' is a nomenclatural procedure governed by Article&amp;nbsp;14 of the ICN.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Its purpose is 
:"to avoid disadvantageous nomenclatural changes entailed by the strict application of the rules, and especially of the principle of priority [...]" (Art.&amp;nbsp;14.1).
Conservation is possible only for names at the rank of [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] or [[species]].

It may effect a change in original spelling, [[Type (biology)|type]], or (most commonly) priority.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* Conserved spelling ('''''orthographia conservanda''''', '''''orth. cons.''''') allows spelling usage to be preserved even if the name was published with another spelling: ''[[Euonymus]]'' (not ''Evonymus''), ''[[Guaiacum]]'' (not ''Guajacum''),  etc. (see [[orthographical variant]]). 
* Conserved types ('''''typus conservandus''''', '''''typ. cons.''''') are often made when it is found that a type in fact belongs to a different taxon from the description, when a name has subsequently been generally misapplied to a different taxon, or when the type belongs to a small group separate from the monophyletic bulk of a taxon.
* Conservation of a name against an earlier taxonomic (heterotypic) synonym (which is termed a '''rejected name''', '''''nomen rejiciendum''''', '''''nom. rej.''''') is relevant only if a particular taxonomist includes both types in the same taxon.

===Rejection===
Besides conservation of names of certain ranks (Art.&amp;nbsp;14), the ICN also offers the option of outright rejection of a name ('''''nomen utique rejiciendum''''') also called '''suppressed name''' under Article&amp;nbsp;56, another way of creating a ''nomen rejiciendum''  that cannot be used anymore. Outright rejection is possible for a name at any rank.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Rejection (suppression) of individual names is distinct from suppression of works ('''''opera utique oppressa''''') under Article&amp;nbsp;34, which allows for listing certain taxonomic ranks in certain publications which are considered not to include any validly published names.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Effects ===
Conflicting conserved names are treated according to the normal rules of priority. Separate proposals (informally referred to as "superconservation" proposals) may be made to protect a conserved name that would be overtaken by another. However, conservation has different consequences depending on the type of name that is conserved:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*A conserved family name is protected against all other family names based on genera that are considered by the taxonomist to be part of the same family.
*A conserved genus or species name is conserved against any [[homonym (biology)|homonym]]s, [[homotypic synonym]]s, and those ''specific'' heterotypic synonyms that are simultaneously declared nomina rejicienda (as well as their own homotypic synonyms).{{clarify|date=September 2013}} As taxonomic changes are made, other names may require new proposals for conservation and/or rejection.

===Documentation===
Conserved and rejected names (and suppressed names) are listed in the appendices to the ICN. As of the 2012 (Melbourne) edition, a separate volume holds the bulk of the appendices (except appendix I, on names of hybrids).&lt;ref name=appendices&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.H.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Barrie, F.R.; Buck, W.R.; Demoulin, V.; Greuter, W.; Hawksworth, D.L.; Herendeen, P.S.; Knapp, S.; Marhold, K.; Prado, J.; Prud'homme van Reine, W.F.; Smith, G.F. |year=2015 |volume=157 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 Appendices II - VIII |publisher=Koeltz Botanical Books |isbn=978-3-87429-480-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance of the second volume is generated from a database which also holds a history of published proposals and their outcomes, the binding decisions on whether a name is validly published (article 38.4) and on whether it is a homonym (article 53.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Wiersema, J.; McNeill, J.; Turland, N.J.; Orli, S.S.; Wagner, W.L. |year=2015 |title=The foundation of the Melbourne Code Appendices: Announcing a new paradigm for tracking nomenclatural decisions |journal=Taxon |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=1021–1027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appendices/&gt; The database can be queried online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://botany.si.edu/references/codes/props/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants: Appendices II-VIII (with an accounting of proposals to conserve and reject names, to suppress works, and requests for binding decisions) |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedure ===
# The procedure starts by submitting a proposal to the journal ''Taxon'' (published by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy|IAPT]]). This proposal should present the case both for and against conservation of a name. Publication notifies anybody concerned that the matter is being considered and makes it possible for those interested to write in. Publication is the start of the formal procedure: it counts as referring the matter "to the appropriate Committee for study" and Rec&amp;nbsp;14A.1 comes into effect. The name in question is (somewhat) protected by this Recommendation ("... authors should follow existing usage as far as possible ...").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
# After reviewing the matter, judging the merits of the case, "the appropriate Committee" makes a decision either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). Then the matter is passed to the General Committee.
# After reviewing the matter, mostly from a procedural angle, the General Committee makes a decision, either against ("not recommended") or in favor ("recommended"). At this point Article&amp;nbsp;14.16 comes into effect. Art 14.16 authorizes all users to indeed use that name.
# The General Committee reports to the Nomenclature Section of the [[International Botanical Congress]], stating which names (including types and spellings) it recommends for conservation. Then, by Div.III.1, the Nomenclature Section makes a decision on which names (including types, spellings) are accepted into the ''Code''. At this stage the ''de facto'' decision is made to modify the ''Code''.
# The Plenary Session of that same International Botanical Congress receives the "resolution moved by the Nomenclature Section of that Congress" and makes a ''de jure'' decision to modify the ''Code''. By long tradition this step is ceremonial in nature only.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the course of time there have been different standards for the majority required for a decision. However, for decades the Nomenclature Section has required a 60% majority for an inclusion in the ''Code'', and the Committees have followed this example, in 1996 adopting a 60% majority for a decision.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Zoology ==
For zoology, the term "conserved name", rather than ''nomen conservandum'', is used in the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature'',&lt;ref name=ICZN/&gt; although informally both terms are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the glossary of the ''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature''&lt;ref name=ICZN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the code for names of animals, one of several [[nomenclature codes]]), this definition is given:
;'''conserved name'''
:A name otherwise unavailable or invalid that the Commission, by the use of its plenary power, has enabled to be used as a [[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] by removal of the known obstacles to such use.

This is a more generalized definition than the one for ''[[nomen protectum]]'', which is specifically a conserved name that is either a junior [[synonym (zoology)|synonym]] or [[homonym (zoology)|homonym]] that is in use because the senior synonym or homonym has been made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'' ("forgotten name").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An example of a conserved name is the [[dinosaur]] genus name ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', which was formally described in 1943. Later, ''Tylosteus'' (which was formally described in 1872) was found to be the same genus as ''Pachycephalosaurus'' (a synonym). By the usual rules, the genus ''Tylosteus'' has precedence and would normally be the correct name. But the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) ruled that the name ''Pachycephalosaurus'' was to be given precedence and treated as the valid name, because it was in more common use and better known to scientists.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The ICZN's procedural details are different from those in botany, but the basic operating principle is the same, with petitions submitted to the commission for review.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Formation of coral.jpg|thumb|upright|Formation of fringing reefs (top), barrier reefs (middle) and atolls (bottom).&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt;]]
One of the marine ecosystems found in the [[Virgin Islands]] are the [[coral reef]]s. These coral reefs can be located between the islands of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], and [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. John]]. These coral reefs have an area of 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, along with other marine habitats that are in between.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;Catanzaro, Don, Rick Nemeth, Caroline Rogers, Zandy Hillis-Starr, and Marcia Taylor, [https://www.coris.noaa.gov/portals/pdfs/status_coralreef_usvi.pdf "The Status of the Coral Reefs of The U.S. Virgin Islands"]&lt;/ref&gt; The way these coral reefs grow are by coral larvae swimming freely and attaching themselves to hard surfaces around the islands and start to develop a skeleton on the outside of their skin to protect themselves from predators but also allow a new place for other coral larvae to attach to and grow on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/ "How Coral Reefs Grow"] Coral Reef Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; These corals can form into three different structures; [[fringing reef]]s, which are reefs that are close to the shore, barrier reefs, which are reefs that are alongside the shore and is separated by deep water, and an [[atoll reef]] which is a coral reef that circles a [[lagoon]] or body of water.&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_reefs.html "Corals"] NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Corals.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution == 
As stated, the coral reefs such as fringing reefs, [[Deep-water coral|deep reef]]s, patch reefs and [[spur and groove formation]] are distributed over three islands in the Virgin Islands which are St. Croix ([[Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve]], [[Buck Island Reef National Monument]]), St. Thomas, and St. John ([[Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument]]). The coral reefs found offshore of St. Thomas and St. John  are distributed patchily around the islands. Additionally, a developed barrier reef system surrounds St. Croix along its eastern and southern shores.[[File:Corals 4.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas.]]

== Ecology ==
The coral reefs as well as hard-bottom habitat accounts for 297.9 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; The coral reefs are home to diverse species. There are over 40 species of [[scleractinian corals]] and three species of [[Millepora]].&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;Caldow, Chris, Barry Devine, Peter Edmunds et al. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227125836_Ecology_of_Coral_Reefs_in_the_US_Virgin_Islands "Ecology of Coral Reefs in the US Virgin Islands"] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Live scleractinian species are found throughout the Virgin Islands, but mainly around [[Buck Island Reef National Monument|Buck Island]], St. Croix and St. John.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt; More specifically based on a survey from 2001-2006, listed are a total of 215 fishes from St. John and 202 from St. Croix.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Four species of [[sea turtle]]s are found within the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The coral reefs are impacted by freshwater environments from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco River]] in the form of anticyclonic rings which are rich in nutrients.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Hazards ==
This marine environment has been degraded in a variety of ways. One of the ways in which the corals have been affected is by the dust from Africa.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; This dust might be affected the corals by causing degradation.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Apart from the dust, the corals also experience a few diseases. There is [[black band disease|black-band disease]] which infects major coral reefs such as [[Montastraea annularis]].&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The most severe diseases are the [[white band disease|white-band]] and [[white plague (coral disease)|white plague]] disease.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; The branching acroporid have been influenced the most.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Corals 5.jpg|thumb|Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas]]
Other than the few diseases listed, other ways in which the corals have been affected are by natural disasters such as hurricanes, human influence such as fishing and pollution, and global warming.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Coral reefs are also being degraded by many other factors:&lt;br /&gt;
* Natural Disasters: coral reefs experience natural disturbance events that can affect and dramatically altered the reef ecosystem. Disasters include hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. 
* Tourism: The [[United States Virgin Islands]] are a popular tourist destination with over two million cruise ship passenger arrivals per year. Tourism generates vast amounts of income for USVI, however, tourism pressures can cause physical damage to the coral reefs. For example, recreation activities (scuba diving and snorkeling), disposal of untreated sewage and poorly placed boat anchors by cruise ships.
* Coastal development: tourism leads to construction projects such as building of hotels and restaurants, coral reefs habitats are destroyed or disturbed by dredging activities and nutrients and sediment run-off.
* Pollution: Pollution from human activities is damaging reefs. Humans dispose unwanted items on beaches, in the sea or near water pathways.
* Overfishing and destructive fishing methods: the coral reefs have been heavily fished due to increasing demand for food. Overfishing of important reef species negatively impact the coral reefs’ biodiversity and ecological. Additionally, some destructive means of fishing are used on coral reefs including [[Blast fishing|dynamite]] and [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]]. These practices often kill fishes and destroy fragile coral reefs. Degrading the coral reef habitat on which the fishes rely on will in turn reduce the productivity of the area.&lt;ref name="First" /&gt;

{{cosmology}}

The term '''''cosmic variance''''' is the [[Statistics|statistical]] [[uncertainty]] inherent in observations of the universe at extreme distances. It has three different but closely related meanings:
* It is sometimes used, incorrectly, to mean [[sample variance]] - the difference between different finite samples of the same parent population. Such differences follow a [[Poissonian distribution]], and in this case the term [[sample variance]] should be used instead.
* It is sometimes used, mainly by cosmologists, to mean the uncertainty because we can only observe one realization of all the possible observable universes. For example, we can only observe one [[Cosmic Microwave Background]], so the measured positions of the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum, integrated over the visible sky,  are limited by the fact that only one  spectrum is observable from Earth. The observable universe viewed from another Galaxy will have the peaks in slightly different places, while remaining consistent with the same physical laws, inflation, etc. This second meaning may be regarded as a special case of the third meaning.
* The most widespread use, to which the rest of this article refers, reflects the fact that measurements are affected by cosmic large-scale structure, so a measurement of any region of sky (viewed from Earth) may differ from a measurement of a different region of sky (also viewed from Earth) by an amount that may be much greater than the sample variance.

This most widespread use of the term is based on the idea that it is only possible to observe part of the universe at one particular time, so it is difficult to make statistical statements about [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] on the scale of the entire universe,&lt;ref name="aspj"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/600/2/L171/17416.html | author=Somerville | title=Cosmic Variance in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey | journal=The [[Astrophysical Journal]] Letters  | year=2004 | volume=600 | issue=2 | pages=L171–L174 | doi=10.1086/378628 | last2=Lee | first2=Kyoungsoo | last3=Ferguson | first3=Henry C. | last4=Gardner | first4=Jonathan P. | last5=Moustakas | first5=Leonidas A. | last6=Giavalisco | first6=Mauro|arxiv = astro-ph/0309071 |bibcode = 2004ApJ...600L.171S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v37n4/aas207/1366.htm|title=Quantifying the Effects of Cosmic Variance Using the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey|accessdate=September 18, 2007|publisher=[[American Astronomical Society]]|year=2006|author=M.S. Keremedjiev (Cornell University)|work=37 #4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102081508/http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v37n4/aas207/1366.htm|archivedate=January 2, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the number of observations ([[sample size]]) must be too small.

== Background ==
The standard [[big bang]] model is usually supplemented with [[cosmic inflation]]. In inflationary models, the observer only sees a tiny fraction of the whole universe, much less than a billionth (1/10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) of the volume of the [[universe]] postulated in inflation.  So the observable universe (the so-called [[particle horizon]] of the universe) is the result of processes that follow some general [[physical laws]], including [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]]. Some of these processes are [[random]]: for example, the distribution of [[galaxies]] throughout the universe can only be described [[statistics|statistically]] and cannot be derived from first principles.

== Philosophical issues ==
This raises [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems:  suppose that random physical processes happen on length scales both smaller than and bigger than the horizon. A physical process (such as an amplitude of a primordial [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] in density) that happens on the horizon scale only gives us one observable realization. A physical process on a larger scale gives us zero observable realizations. A physical process on a slightly smaller scale gives us a small number of realizations.

In the case of only one realization it is difficult to draw statistical conclusions about its significance. For example, if the underlying model of a physical process implies that the observed property should occur only 1% of the time, does that really mean that the model is excluded? Consider the physical model of the citizenship of human beings in the early 21st century, where about 30% are [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] citizens, about 5% are [[United States|American]] citizens, about 1% are [[France|French]] citizens, and so on. For an observer who has only one observation (of his/her own citizenship) and who happens to be French and cannot make any external observations, the model can be rejected at the 99% significance level. Yet the external observers with more information unavailable to the first observer, know that the model is correct.

In other words, even if the bit of the universe observed is the result of a statistical process, the observer can only view one realization of that process, so our observation is statistically insignificant for saying much about the model, unless the observer is careful to include the [[variance]]. This variance is called the ''cosmic variance'' and is separate from other sources of experimental error: a very accurate measurement of only one value drawn from a [[probability distribution|distribution]] still leaves considerable uncertainty about the underlying model. Variance is normally plotted separately from other sources of uncertainty. Because it is necessarily a large fraction of the signal, workers must be very careful in interpreting the statistical significance of measurements on scales close to the [[particle horizon|horizon]].

In [[physical cosmology]], the common way of dealing with this on the horizon scale and on slightly sub-horizon scales (where the number of occurrences is greater than one but still quite small), is to explicitly include the [[variance]] of very small statistical samples ([[Poisson distribution]]) when calculating [[uncertainty|uncertainties]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Analysis of the Kamionkowski-Loeb method of reducing cosmic variance with CMB polarization|publisher=Department of Astrophysics, Oxford / Smithsonian/NASA Astronomy Abstract Service|year=2004|author=Portsmouth, Jamie|bibcode=2004PhRvD..70f3504P|arxiv = astro-ph/0402173 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in describing the low [[spherical harmonic|multipoles]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and has been the source of much controversy in the cosmology community since the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]] measurements.

== Similar problems ==
A similar problem is faced by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]. Just as cosmologists have a [[statistical sample|sample size]] of one universe, biologists have a sample size of one fossil record. The problem is closely related to the [[anthropic principle]].

Another problem of limited sample sizes in astronomy, here practical rather than essential, is in the [[Titius–Bode law]] on spacing of satellites in an orbital system. Originally observed for the Solar System, the difficulty in observing other solar systems has limited data to test this.

'''Criminal investigation''' is an [[applied science]] that involves the study of facts, used to identify, locate and prove the [[guilt (law)|guilt]] of an accused criminal. A complete criminal investigation can include [[Search and seizure|searching]], [[interview]]s, [[interrogation]]s, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] collection and preservation and various methods of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (Sixth Edition). Charles E. O'Hara and Gregory L. O'Hara; 1994; {{ISBN|0-398-05889-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day criminal investigations commonly employ many modern scientific techniques known collectively as [[forensic science]].

Criminal investigation is an ancient science that may have roots as far back as c. 1700 BCE in the writings of the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. In the code it is suggested that both the accuser and the accused had the right to present evidence they collected.&lt;ref&gt;Victimology:Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr,Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era criminal investigations are most often done by government [[Police|police forces]]. [[Private investigator]]s are also commonly hired to complete or assist in criminal investigations.

An early recorded professional criminal investigator was the English [[constable]]. Around 1250 CE it was recorded that the constable was to "...record...matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law."&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Bratton (1968). Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England; volume 4 pg 136. Cambridge, MS: Belknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation priority bias problems and proposed solutions ==
After observing recent changes in the demographic composition of particular crimes during higher priority of their investigation, such as the increase of the percentage of women convicted for joining and fighting for [[terrorism|terrorist]] organizations from a very low percentage (similar to those of murder and rape) to almost as many women as men (women in the 40-50 percent range in some jurisdictions) as the priority of investigating terror crimes increased, certain criminologists are expressing the notion that there may be more crimes that would change their demographics if they got higher priority. These criminologists theorize that in the case of limited budgets, criminal investigators rely on profiled and statistical likelihood of particular groups of people being convicted for the type of crimes that are being investigated, and ignore complaints that are filed about people that they consider less likely to commit the crimes or give the tracking or individual matching to the evidence lower priority. According to the hypotheses, even a minimal or nonexistent difference in the likelihood of committing crimes can be hidden behind a difference of a factor by many multiples in the likelihood of being convicted due to [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] in the statistics. These criminologists feel that criminals who are not getting caught due to being profiled as unlikely offenders are a major problem. Some of these criminologists propose an increased number of police officers. Others argue that investigations of the evidence are more expensive than police patrols and that not all crimes can be investigated, suggesting that profiling of [[criminal psychology]] should be replaced with randomized priorities of individual suspects within similar types of crime. The latter criminologists also argue that such randomization would not only fight hidden crimes by exposing the currently unsuspected criminals to the risk of being punished, but also that the abolition of profiling by forensic psychology and forensic psychiatry would be a monetary saving that could be used for investigation of technical evidence, tracking of criminals who are hiding and other investigation work that can reduce the need to ignore complaints for budget reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Morality, Rationality and Efficiency: New Perspectives on Socio-economics", 2016 by Richard M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3178">In [[cell biology]], [[molecular biology]] and related fields, the word '''extracellular''' (or sometimes '''extracellular space''') means "outside the [[cell (biology)|cell]]". This space is usually taken to be outside the [[plasma membrane]]s, and occupied by fluid (see '''[[extracellular matrix]]'''). The term is used in contrast to [[intracellular]] (inside the cell).

According to the [[gene ontology]] database the extracellular space is a cellular component defined as: "That part of a multicellular organism outside the cells proper, usually taken to be outside the plasma membranes, and occupied by fluid. For multicellular organisms, the extracellular space refers to everything outside a cell, but still within the organism (excluding the extracellular matrix). Gene products from a multi-cellular organism that are secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood can therefore be annotated to this term".&lt;ref&gt;Extracellular Space by Gene Ontology database (EMBL-EBI)&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the extracellular space includes [[metabolite]]s, [[ion]]s, various [[protein]]s and non-protein substances (e.g. DNA, RNA, lipids, microbial products etc.) that might affect cellular function. For example, [[hormone]]s, [[growth factor]]s, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s act by travelling the extracellular space towards [[biochemical receptor]]s on cells. Other proteins that are active outside the cell are various [[enzymes]], including digestive enzymes ([[Trypsin]], [[Pepsin]]), extracellular proteinases ([[Matrix metalloproteinase]]s, [[ADAMTS]]s, [[Cathepsin]]s) and antioxidant enzymes (extracellular [[superoxide dismutase]]). Often, proteins present in the extracellular space are stored outside the cells by attaching to various extracellular matrix components ([[Collagen]]s, [[Proteoglycan]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''French Gothic architecture''' is a style which emerged in France in 1140, and was dominant until the mid-16th century. The most notable examples are the great Gothic cathedrals of France, including [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
French Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[Ile-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081-1137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place.  The Abbot of Saint-Denis,  [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as an historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings; [[Philip Augustus]] (1180-1223); [[Louis IX of France]] (1226-1270) and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285-1314) established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]].  It produced the high Gothic and the Flamboyant Gothic styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rib vault===
The Gothic style emerged from innovative use of existing technologies, such as the pointed arch and the [[rib vault]].   The [[rib vault]] was known in the earlier Romanesque period, but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below, and established a closer connection  between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls, and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flying buttress===
The second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone pinnacles were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church.   In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals.  Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels,  a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the tribune, a gallery with windows; then the triforium, a row of smaller windows, and finally the high windows. just below the vaults.   During the high Gothic period, with the development of the four part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pages 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

===The portal and tympanum===
Another innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral  was the design of the portal or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This  triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals.  A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]  over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating  a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained glass and the rose window===

Large [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The [[Rose window]] was the most famous type of the Gohtic style.  They were plead in the transepts and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter.  They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind.  Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.

The early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with grisaille painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used.  After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of  [[grisaille]] and pale shades of yellow became more common.  [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of Gothic styles==
The periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pgs. 31-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130-1230)
* '''High Gothic''' or '''Classic Gothic''' (1230-1330)
* '''[[Rayonnant]]'''  (14th Century)
* '''[[Flamboyant]]''' (15th Century)
* '''Late Gothic'''  (16th Century)

Because of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic Cathedrals, very few were built in a single style.  Most, like Notre Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.

==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[Île-de-France]], not far north of Paris,  where in 1137 The [[Abbé Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from  1140 to 1144  began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new choir at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pages 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]]; the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]; the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels; and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults.   The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time had all been combined and the result differed  dramatically  from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals, notably [[Sens Cathedral]], the first Gothic Cathedral  (begun 1135); [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new  Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the [[flying buttress]], heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Gothic Cathedrals: Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably  [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by with an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre Dame==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period of French gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency  toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flamboyant Gothic: Rouen Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Flamboyant Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[Île-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features a vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032–1523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Musée Jean-Lurçat, a museum of contemporary tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under KingH [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211–1331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280–1325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220–1522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier romanesque churches on the same site.

The south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style : the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world.

==Gothic civil architecture==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration  borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing  gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I,  due to their proximity to the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), page 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Gothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities.  examples include the [[Hôtel Cluny]] (now the [[Musée de Cluny – Musée national du Moyen Âge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques Cœur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440–50).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569–1573  made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cathédrale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]].  [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507–1512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carré of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533–1568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012) page 26–27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious –buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschaussé (1613–1620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615–21) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model.  However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris, (1532–1640) which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a gothic plan with renaissance decoration.

In the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[François Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Molière]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...".

During the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]].   The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round  were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire  arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings  (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below.  In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pgs. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed.    The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers, to  One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337-1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.   The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the city of [[Carcasonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Château de Pierrefonds]], (1393-1407)  an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.

==Restoration and Gothic revival==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the façade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalog the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of "Monuments of France". In 1831 interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832 Hugo wrote an article for the ''Revue des deux Mondes'' which declared war against the "massacre of ancient stones" and the "demolishers" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[François Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne.  In 1833 Prosper Mérimée became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156–159}}

Under Louis Philippe,French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under Mérimée's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835 The church of [[Saint-Séverin, Paris|Saint Séverin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by  [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution,  The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[Félix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].   In 1843 Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] &lt;ref&gt;Darcos (1988), page 156-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.

French Gothic architecture also experienced a modest  revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841–57);  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65).  Jean=Baptiste  Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacré-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the Église de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}   The [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cécile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854–55) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework.  [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Texier (2012), pgs. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture and Symbolism - the "Book for the Poor"==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

File:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] of [[Chartres Cathedral]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a "book for the poor", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].

The exteriors of Cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters, These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gargoyle]] also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.

Amid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a scepter in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler (2018), pages 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the Cathedral.  Inapired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  In Cathedrals, they were known as the "Path of Jerusalem" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.

==Sculpture==
The portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates Classical, literary elements with its 13th century Gothic style. In [[Auxerre]], two such examples of sculptures are upon the Cathedral of [[Saint-Étienne]] depicting [[Hercules]], a satyr, and a sleeping faun; the Chartres–[[Reims]] cathedral's north transept illustrates the biblical tale of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]]. The [[Sens Cathedral]]'s "Coronation of the Virgin" reflects a similar relief cathedral on the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris, and was created in a workshop that made minor contributions to [[Spanish Gothic architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Paul. "Gothic Sculpture 1140–1300". {{ISBN|978-0300074529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable structures==

* The east end of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]] (begun 1135)
* [[Noyon Cathedral]] (1145–1235)
* [[Sens Cathedral]] (1135–1534)
* [[Lyon Cathedral]]

* Notre-Dame-de-Lamourguier in [[Narbonne]]
* Sainte-Marie in [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]]
* [[Church of the Jacobins]] in Toulouse

[[Image:Ladderfuels.png|thumb|right|380 px|Illustration from U.S. government publication, Introduction to Wildland Fire Behavior (S-190), showing the fuel ladder]]

A '''fuel ladder''' is a [[firefighting]] term for live or dead [[vegetation]] that allows a [[fire]] to climb up from the [[landscape]] or [[forest floor]] into the tree [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. Common fuel ladders include tall [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s, and [[tree]] [[branch]]es, both living and dead. It is also part of [[Defensible space (fire control)|Defensible Space]] 'Firescaping' practices.

==Fire precautions==
Potential fuel ladders should be removed to reduce the risk of fire bridging the gap to the canopy. To remove the ladder requires pruning any low limbs up to a minimum of 8 feet, and potentially as high as 15 feet. The required height depends on how low the branch tips hang, the steepness of slope, and the height and spacing of other nearby vegetation. 

The desired result is to create a situation in which a low-burning fire could burn to the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a tree, which is protected by its [[Bark (botany)|bark]], without having thinner, more flammable branches, [[leaf|leaves]] or [[Pine needle|needles]] within easy reach of the fire.

==Other fuel ladders==
Apart from tree limbs, anything that would help that fire move up into the tree canopy is a fuel ladder. This includes shrubs and even tall grass or weeds. Non-vegetation fuel sources such as woodpiles, wooden fenceposts and structures should also be considered. 

The intent is to maintain a break in vertical and horizontal continuity so that, if for example a woodpile caught fire, it would not be positioned next to ''[[manzanita]]'' [[shrubs]] or directly under trees that could then easily catch fire.

'''Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis (FASA)''' (also '''fuzzy inference system (FIS) based architectural space analysis''' or '''fuzzy spatial analysis''') is a [[spatial analysis]] method of analysing the spatial formation and architectural space intensity within any architectural organization.&lt;ref&gt;Arabacioglu, Burcin Cem (2010). "Using fuzzy inference system for architectural space analysis". Applied Soft Computing 10 (3): 926–937. {{doi|10.1016/j.asoc.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis is used in [[architecture]], [[interior design]], [[urban planning]] and similar [[spatial design]] fields.

==Overview==
Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis was developed by [[Burcin Cem Arabacioglu]] (2010) from the architectural theories of [[space syntax]]&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill and Hanson, Julienne (1984), "The Social Logic of Space", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Bill (1999), "Space is the Machine: A Configurational Theory of Architecture", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[visibility graph analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Alasdair; Doxa, Maria; O'Sullivan, David and Penn, Alan (2001). "From isovists to visibility graphs: a methodology for the analysis of architectural space". Environment and Planning B 28 (1): 103–121. {{doi|10.1068/b2684}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is applied with the help of a fuzzy system with a Mamdami inference system based on [[fuzzy logic]] within any architectural space. Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis model analyses the space by considering the perceivable architectural element by their boundary and stress characteristics and intensity properties. The method is capable of taking all [[Sense|sensorial]] factors into account during analyses in conformably with the [[perception]] process of architectural space which is a multi-sensorial act.

'''GroupLens Research''' is a [[human–computer interaction]] research lab in the [[Department of Computer Science and Engineering (University of Minnesota)|Department of Computer Science and Engineering]] at the [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]] specializing in [[recommender system]]s and [[virtual community|online communities]]. GroupLens also works with [[mobile computing|mobile]] and [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous]] technologies, [[digital library|digital libraries]], and local [[geographic information system]]s.

The GroupLens lab was one of the first to study automated recommender systems with the construction of the "GroupLens" recommender, a [[Usenet]] article recommendation engine, and [[MovieLens]], a popular movie recommendation site used to study recommendation engines, tagging systems, and user interfaces.  The lab has also gained notability for its members' work studying open content communities such as [[Cyclopath]], a computational "[[geo-wiki]]" currently being used in the [[Twin Cities]] to help plan the regional cycling system.&lt;ref name="Cycloplan"&gt;{{cite web

==History==

=== Formation ===
In 1992, [[John Riedl]] and [[Paul Resnick]] attended the
[[Computer Supported Cooperative Work|CSCW]] [[academic conference|conference]]
together.  After they heard [[keynote|keynote speaker]] Shumpei Kumon talk
about his vision for an [[information economy]],&lt;ref&gt;

system for [[Usenet|Usenet news]].  The system collected ratings from Usenet readers and used those ratings to predict how much other readers would like an article before they read it.  This recommendation engine was one of the first automated collaborative filtering systems in which algorithms were used to automatically form predictions based on historical patterns of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2009-12-23--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall system was called the "GroupLens" recommender, and the servers that collected the ratings and performed the computation were called the "Better Bit Bureau".  This name was later dropped after a request from the [[Better Business Bureau]].  "GroupLens" is now used as a name both for this recommender system, and for the research lab at the University of Minnesota.

A [[feasibility study|feasibility test]] was done between [[MIT]] and
the University of Minnesota and a research paper was published including
the [[algorithm]], the system design, and the results of the feasibility
study, in the CSCW conference of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1993, Riedl and Resnick invited [[Joseph Konstan]] to join the
team.  Together, they decided to create a higher-performance
implementation of the algorithms to support larger-scale deployments.
In summer 1995 the team gathered
[[Bradley Miller (academic)|Bradley Miller]], [[David Maltz]],
[[Jon Herlocker]], and [[Mark Claypool]] for "Hack Week" to create
the new implementation, and to plan the next round of experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

In the Spring of 1996, the first workshop on
[[collaborative filtering]] was put together by Resnick and
[[Hal Varian]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;

There, researchers from projects around the US
that were studying similar systems came together to share ideas and
experience.

=== Net Perceptions ===
In the summer of 1996, [[David Gardiner (academic)|David Gardiner]], a
former Ph.D. student of Riedl's, introduced [[John Riedl]] to [[Steven Snyder]].
Snyder had been an early employee at [[Microsoft]], but left
Microsoft to come to Minnesota to do a Ph.D. in [[Psychology]].  He
realized the commercial potential of collaborative filtering, and
encouraged the team to found a company in April 1996.  By June,
Gardiner, Snyder, Miller, Riedl, and Konstan had
[[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] their company, and by July
they had their first round of funding, from the [[Hummer-Winblad]]
[[venture capital]] company.&lt;ref&gt;

in business until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; site closed in 1997, the researchers behind it released
the anonymous rating data they had collected, for other researchers
to use.  The GroupLens Research team, led by Brent Dahlen and Jon
Herlocker, used this [[data set]] to jumpstart a new movie recommendation
site called [[MovieLens]] which has been a very visible research platform, including a detailed discussion in a New Yorker article by
[[Malcolm Gladwell]],&lt;ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2002 the group continued its research on
collaborative filtering, which became known in the community by the
more general term of [[recommender systems]]. With Joe Konstan's expertise in [[user interface]]s,&lt;ref&gt;

=== Studying online communities ===
In 2002, GroupLens expanded into [[social computing]] and [[virtual community|online communities]] with the addition of [[Loren Terveen]], who was known for his research of ''social'' recommender systems such as PHOAKS.&lt;ref&gt;

In order to broaden the set of research ideas and tools they used,
Riedl, Konstan, and Terveen invited colleagues in [[social psychology]]
([[Robert E. Kraut|Robert Kraut]] and [[Sara Kiesler]], of the
[[Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute]]), and
economic and social analysis ([[Paul Resnick]] and
[[Yan Chen (academic)|Yan Chen]] of the
[[University of Michigan School of Information]]) to collaborate.  The
new, larger team adopted the name [[CommunityLab]], and looked
generally at the effects of technological interventions on the
performance of online communities. For instance, some of their
research explored technology for enriching conversation systems,&lt;ref&gt;

* '''MovieLens ratings datasets:''' In the early days of recommender systems, research was slowed down by the lack of publicly available datasets.  In response to requests from other researchers, GroupLens released three datasets:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grouplens.org/node/73&lt;/ref&gt; the MovieLens 100,000 rating dataset, the MovieLens 1,000,000 rating dataset, and the MovieLens 10,000,000 rating dataset.  These datasets became the standard datasets for recommender research, and have been used in over 300 papers by researchers around the world.  The dataset is also being used for teaching about recommender technology.&lt;ref&gt;

* '''[[Information leakage]] from recommender datasets:'''  a paper in the [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|information retrieval]] conference analyzed the privacy risks to users of having large recommender datasets released.  The basic risk discovered is that an anonymized dataset might be combined with public information to identify a user. For instance, a user who has written about his preference for movies on [[internet forum|online forums]] could be associated with a specific row in the MovieLens datasets.  In some cases, these associations might leak information the user would prefer to keep private.&lt;ref&gt;

This paper was one of the first to focus on the length of time that a contribution survives within Wikipedia as a measure of its value.  The paper also investigated the effects of vandalism on Wikipedia readers, by measuring the probability that a view of a page would capture that page in a vandalized state. GroupLens has also explored ways to help editors find pages which they can effectively contribute to with the [[User:SuggestBot#Getting recommendations|SuggestBot]] recommender.&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
With the sequencing of the genomes of a diverse array or model organisms, it became clear that the number of genes does not correlate with the human perception of relative organism complexity – the human [[proteome]] contains some 20 000 genes,&lt;ref name="pmid18474865"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amaral LA | title = A truer measure of our ignorance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6795–6 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18474865 | pmc = 2383987 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0802459105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is smaller than some species such as corn. A statistical approach to calculating the number of [[Protein–protein interaction|interactions]] in humans gives an estimate of around 650 000, one order of magnitude bigger than [[Drosophila]] and 3 times larger than [[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. Elegans]].&lt;ref name="pmid18474861"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stumpf MP, Thorne T, de Silva E, Stewart R, An HJ, Lappe M, Wiuf C | title = Estimating the size of the human interactome | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 19 | pages = 6959–64 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18474861 | pmc = 2383957 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0708078105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, only about &lt;0.3% of all estimated interactions among human proteins has been identified,&lt;ref name="pmid15193308"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bork P, Jensen LJ, von Mering C, Ramani AK, Lee I, Marcotte EM | title = Protein interaction networks from yeast to human | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 292–9 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15193308 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2004.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although in recent years there has been exponential growth in discovery – as of 2015,&lt;ref name=hintkb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konstantinos|first1=Theofilatos|last2=Dimitrakopoulos|first2=Christos|last3=Kleftogiannis|first3=Dimitrios|last4=Charalampos|first4=Moschopoulos|last5=Stergios|first5=Papadimitriou|last6=Likothanassis|first6=Spiros|last7=Seferina|first7=Mavroudi | name-list-format = vanc |title=HINT-KB: The Human Interactome Knowledge Base|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s10462-013-9409-8|volume=42|pages=427–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 210 000 unique human positive protein–protein interactions are currently catalogued, and bioGRID database contains almost 750 000 literature-curated PPI's for 30 model organisms, 300 000 of which are verified or predicted human physical or genetic protein–protein interactions, a 50% increase from 2013.&lt;ref name="pmid25428363"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatr-Aryamontri A, Breitkreutz BJ, Oughtred R, Boucher L, Heinicke S, Chen D, Stark C, Breitkreutz A, Kolas N, O'Donnell L, Reguly T, Nixon J, Ramage L, Winter A, Sellam A, Chang C, Hirschman J, Theesfeld C, Rust J, Livstone MS, Dolinski K, Tyers M | title = The BioGRID interaction database: 2015 update | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 43 | issue = Database issue | pages = D470-8 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25428363 | pmc = 4383984 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku1204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The currently available information on the human interactome network originates from either literature-curated interactions,&lt;ref name="pmid16189514"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rual JF, Venkatesan K, Hao T, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Dricot A, Li N, Berriz GF, Gibbons FD, Dreze M, Ayivi-Guedehoussou N, Klitgord N, Simon C, Boxem M, Milstein S, Rosenberg J, Goldberg DS, Zhang LV, Wong SL, Franklin G, Li S, Albala JS, Lim J, Fraughton C, Llamosas E, Cevik S, Bex C, Lamesch P, Sikorski RS, Vandenhaute J, Zoghbi HY, Smolyar A, Bosak S, Sequerra R, Doucette-Stamm L, Cusick ME, Hill DE, Roth FP, Vidal M | display-authors = 6 | title = Towards a proteome-scale map of the human protein-protein interaction network | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7062 | pages = 1173–8 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16189514 | doi = 10.1038/nature04209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput experiments]],&lt;ref name=hintkb/&gt; or from potential interactions predicted from interactome data, whether through [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] profiling (evolutionary similarity), statistical network inference,&lt;ref name="pmid16723010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Margolin AA, Nemenman I, Basso K, Wiggins C, Stolovitzky G, Dalla Favera R, Califano A | title = ARACNE: an algorithm for the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks in a mammalian cellular context | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 7 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16723010 | pmc = 1810318 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-7-S1-S7 }}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or text/literature mining methods.&lt;ref name="pmid18673526"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeger S, Gaudan S, Leser U, Rebholz-Schuhmann D | title = Integrating protein-protein interactions and text mining for protein function prediction | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 9 Suppl 8 | issue =  | pages = S2 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18673526 | pmc = 2500093 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S8-S2 }}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protein–protein interactions]] are only the raw material for networks. To form useful interactome [[database]]s and create integrated networks, other types of data that can be combined with protein–protein interactions include information on [[gene expression]] and co-expression, cellular co-localization of proteins (based on [[Förster resonance energy transfer|microscopy]]), genetic information, metabolic and [[Signal transduction|signalling pathways]], and more.&lt;ref name="pmid21150998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonetta L | title = Protein-protein interactions: Interactome under construction | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7325 | pages = 851–4 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21150998 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/468851a }}&lt;/ref&gt; The end goal of unravelling human protein interactomes is ultimately to understand mechanisms of disease and uncover previously unknown disease genes. It has been found that proteins with a high number of interactions (outward edges) are significantly more likely to be hubs in modules that correlate with disease,&lt;ref name=hintkb/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23340843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reimand J, Bader GD | title = Systematic analysis of somatic mutations in phosphorylation signaling predicts novel cancer drivers | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 637 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23340843 | pmc = 3564258 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; probably because proteins with more interactions are involved in more biological functions.

Analysis of metabolic networks of proteins hearkens back to the 1940s, but it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that computational data-driven genomic analyses to predict functional context and networks of genetic associations appeared in earnest.&lt;ref name="pmid18474865"/&gt; Since then, the [[interactome]]s of many [[model organism]]s are considered to have been well characterized, notably the [[Yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] Interactome&lt;ref name="pmid18719252"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Braun P, Yildirim MA, Lemmens I, Venkatesan K, Sahalie J, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Gebreab F, Li N, Simonis N, Hao T, Rual JF, Dricot A, Vazquez A, Murray RR, Simon C, Tardivo L, Tam S, Svrzikapa N, Fan C, de Smet AS, Motyl A, Hudson ME, Park J, Xin X, Cusick ME, Moore T, Boone C, Snyder M, Roth FP, Barabási AL, Tavernier J, Hill DE, Vidal M | display-authors = 6 | title = High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5898 | pages = 104–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719252 | pmc = 2746753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1158684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Drosophila]] interactome.&lt;ref name="pmid14605208"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giot L, Bader JS, Brouwer C, Chaudhuri A, Kuang B, Li Y, Hao YL, Ooi CE, Godwin B, Vitols E, Vijayadamodar G, Pochart P, Machineni H, Welsh M, Kong Y, Zerhusen B, Malcolm R, Varrone Z, Collis A, Minto M, Burgess S, McDaniel L, Stimpson E, Spriggs F, Williams J, Neurath K, Ioime N, Agee M, Voss E, Furtak K, Renzulli R, Aanensen N, Carrolla S, Bickelhaupt E, Lazovatsky Y, DaSilva A, Zhong J, Stanyon CA, Finley RL, White KP, Braverman M, Jarvie T, Gold S, Leach M, Knight J, Shimkets RA, McKenna MP, Chant J, Rothberg JM | display-authors = 6 | title = A protein interaction map of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5651 | pages = 1727–36 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14605208 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1090289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High throughput experimental approaches for discovering protein–protein interactions typically perform a version of the [[two-hybrid screening]] approach or [[tandem affinity purification]] followed by [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="pmid16189514"/&gt; Information from experiments and literature curation are compiled into databases of protein interactions, such as DIP,&lt;ref name="pmid11752321"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xenarios I, Salwínski L, Duan XJ, Higney P, Kim SM, Eisenberg D | title = DIP, the Database of Interacting Proteins: a research tool for studying cellular networks of protein interactions | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 303–5 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11752321 | pmc = 99070 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.1.303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BioGRID]].&lt;ref name="pmid25428363"/&gt; A more recent effort, HINT-KB,&lt;ref name=hintkb/&gt; attempts to amalgamate most of the current PPI databases, but filtering systematically erroneous interactions as well as trying to correct for inherent sociological sampling biases in literature curated datasets.

The first attempts at large-scale integrative human [[interactome]] mapping occurred around 2005.

In 2010, around 130 000 binary interactions in the interactome were described in the most popular databases, but many were verified with only one source.&lt;ref name="pmid21150998"/&gt; With the rapid development of high throughput methods, datasets still suffer from high rates of [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]] and low coverage of the interactome.

A recent resource paper (November 2014) &lt;ref name="pmid25416956"/&gt; attempts to provide a more comprehensive [[proteome]] level map of the human interactome. It found vast uncharted territory in the human interactome, and used diverse methods to build a new interactome map correcting for curation bias, including probing all pairwise combinations of 13 000 protein products for interaction using Yeast two hybrid and co-affinity purification, in a massive coordinated effort across research labs in Canada and the United States. However, this still represents confirmation of but a fraction of expected interactions – around 30 000 of high confidence. Despite the coordinated efforts of many, the human interactome is still very much a work in progress.&lt;ref name="pmid25416956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20589078"/&gt;

The '''International Center on Small Hydro Power''' (ICSHP) is a non-profit institution operating under the auspices of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) to promote the development of [[small hydro power]]. The ICSHP is also the headquarters of the International Network on Small Hydro Power (INSHP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iecoafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=69|title=Hydropower organisations|publisher=www.iecoafrica.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The ICSHP was formed in 1994 by the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) in co-operation with the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Following approval from the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] in 1999 the ICSHP became the first international institution to be established in China. The following year an official agreement between the Chinese government brought the ICSHP directly under the auspices of UNIDO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energypedia.info/wiki/Hydropower_-_International_Organisations#International_Association_for_Small_Hydro|title=International hydropower organisations|publisher=Energypedia |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment has been described as 'one of the major achievements of China's reform and a symbol of world SHP demand, which reflects the international status of China's SHP development'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/the-outlook-for-small-hydropower-in-china/?pagenum=7|title=The Outlook for Small Hydropower in China|publisher=www.powermag.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/jul/21china.htm|title=Chinese know how for small hydropower stations|publisher=[[Rediff]] |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ICSHP was established 'to promote small hydropower development worldwide'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a specific focus on developing countries, south-south co-operation and the promotion of small hydro power for 'the social, economic and environmental development of rural areas'. The organisation provides training, advice, research and information exchange on small hydro power development and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=4|title=ICSHP Main Tasks|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the ICSHP is also in keeping with UNIDO's focus on promoting South-South Co-operation, 'by encouraging more horizontal investment flows'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browne |first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=UNIDO: Industrial solutions for a sustainable future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw9PhbZ8jnEC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= |isbn= |access-date=12/5/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Small Hydro Power Development Report ==
In 2013 the ICSHP and UNIDO published the World Small Hydro Power Development Report. According to Li Yong, Director-General of UNIDO, the report was "a world first compilation of global small hydropower data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/news/press/first-launched.html|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2013|publisher=UNIDO|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed small hydro power development in 149 countries across 20 regions from over 60 different authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/11/unido-icshp-release-comprehensive-small-hydropower-study.html|title=UNIDO, ICSHP release comprehensive small hydropower study|publisher=www.hydroworld.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that while installed small hydro power was estimated at 75 GW, potential small hydro power was approximately 173 GW. Over 50% of the world's potential small hydro power was found to be in Asia however the report noted "It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents". In 2015 it was announced that a second, updated edition of the report would be published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/article.asp?id=471|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2016|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy-l.iisd.org/news/unido-icshp-launch-small-hydropower-knowledge-sharing-portal|title=UNIDO, ICSHP Launch Small Hydropower Knowledge Sharing Portal|publisher=Sustainable Energy Policy and Practice|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energias-renovables.com/articulo/small-hydropower-a-promising-technology-for-rural-20130514|title=Small Hydropower, a promising technology for rural electrification|publisher=www.energias-renovables.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Skolnick''' is an American [[Computational biology|computational biologist]]. He is currently a [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] School of Biology Professor, the Director of the [[Center for the Study of Systems Biology]], the Mary and Maisie Gibson Chair, the [[Georgia Research Alliance]] Eminent Scholar in Computational Systems Biology, the Director of the [[Integrative BioSystems Institute]], and Scientific Advisor at Intellimedix.&lt;ref name=SURA&gt;{{cite news|title=SURA Honors Georgia Tech Biologist as Distinguished Scientist|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-362981673.html|accessdate=3 August 2014|work=Proteomics Weekly|publisher=NewsRX|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has focused on the development of computational algorithms and their application to proteomes for the prediction of protein structure and function, the prediction of small molecule ligand-protein interactions with applications to drug discovery,  the prediction of off-target uses of existing drugs, and the exploration of the interplay between protein physics and evolution in determining protein structure and function.

Skolnick is most known for demonstrating that the number of [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|ligand]] [[Protein#Cell signaling and ligand binding|binding pockets]] in proteins is quite small, thereby justifying the likelihood that large scale drug repurposing will work. This combined with the ability to use predicted as well as experimental structures in virtual ligand screening at higher accuracy and precision than existing approaches will enable FDA approved drugs with novel mechanisms of action to be identified computationally with a high likelihood of experimental success.&lt;ref name=completeness1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.|last2=Hubner|first2=I.

== Major Discoveries ==

=== Completeness of the library of protein structures and interactions ===

Skolnick was first to demonstrate that the library of single domain protein structures is likely complete and that the observed folds in nature arise from the confinement of dense polymer chains. He further demonstrated that the confinement of these dense polymer chains plus hydrodynamic interactions were the dominant contributor to diffusive processes in cells. Moreover, that the hydrodynamic interactions introduced large scale temporal and spatial correlations that may have important functional consequences.&lt;ref name=completeness1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=completeness2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yang|title=Protein structure prediction: when is it useful?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–155|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2009.02.005|pmc=2673339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saltsman|first1=Kirstie|title=Modeling How Molecules Move Inside Cells|url=http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/computinglife/molecules_move.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ligand homology modeling ===
He also pioneered the field of ligand homology modeling with his threading based, FINDSITE approach for protein function inference, binding site prediction and virtual ligand screening. The research showed that remotely related proteins identified by threading often share a common ligand binding site occupied by chemically similar ligands that contain strongly conserved anchor functional groups as well as a variable region that accounts for their binding specificity. These insights enable low-resolution predicted structures to be used for ligand screening/binding pose prediction, with comparable accuracy as with high-resolution experimental structures. In virtual ligand screening, the latest version, FINDSITEcomb, was shown to work far better than more traditional virtual screening approaches on both predicted and high resolution experimental structures.&lt;ref name=findsite&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brylinski|first1=M.|last2=Skolnick|first2=J.|title=A threading-based method (FINDSITE) for ligand-binding site prediction and functional annotation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=28 December 2007|volume=105|issue=1|pages=129–134|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707684105|pmid=18165317|pmc=2224172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karypis|first1=George|last2=Rangwala|first2=Huzefa|title=Introduction to Protein Structure Prediction: Methods and Algorithms|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons,|isbn=1-118-09946-X|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TASSER protein structure prediction ===
He also developed the TASSER protein structure prediction approach, whose variants are the top performers in [[CASP]] and the basis for the [[I-TASSER]] service. TASSER was among the first methods whose models are closer to the native structure than the starting template.&lt;ref name=tasser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yang|last2=Arakaki|first2=Adrian K.|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|title=TASSER: An automated method for the prediction of protein tertiary structures in CASP6|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|volume=61|issue=S7|pages=91–98|doi=10.1002/prot.20724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roy|first1=Ambrish|last2=Kucukural|first2=Alper|last3=Zhang|first3=Yang|title=I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction|journal=Nature Protocols|date=25 March 2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=725–738|doi=10.1038/nprot.2010.5|pmid=20360767|pmc=2849174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman electrostatic persistence length ===
Skolnick's Ph.D. thesis " “Investigations on a Rod Like Polyelectrolyte Model", along with Fixman and Odijk, developed a theory for the electrostatic persistence length in polyelectrolytes now known as the [[Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman electrostatic persistence length]] which is still considered the classical benchmark.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skolnick|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Fixman|first2=Marshall|title=Electrostatic Persistence Length of a Wormlike Polyelectrolyte|journal=Macromolecules|volume=10|issue=5|pages=944–948|doi=10.1021/ma60059a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dias|first1=Rita|last2=Lindman|first2=Bjorn|title=DNA Interactions with Polymers and Surfactants|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons,|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Skolnick graduated Summa Cum Laude from Washington University in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry. After Washington University, he moved on to Yale where he graduated with a Master of Philosophy in Chemistry in 1977 and a Ph.D. in Chemistry just one year later in 1978.

His Ph.D. thesis, “Investigations on a Rod Like Polyelectrolyte Model”, focused on polymer statistical mechanics with Dr. Marshall Fixman. The methods described by Skolnick and Fixman and independently developed by Theo Odijk are still used as the basis for the electrostatic persistence length of polyelectrolytes.&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt;

== Academic Recognition ==

=== Awards ===
Skolnick has been recognized as a Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Biophysical Society, and the St. Louis Academy of Science.  He has also been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Fellows|url=http://www.sloan.org/fellowships/past-fellows/|publisher=Alfred P.

'''Langa Education Assistance Program (LEAP)''', also known as '''LEAP Science and Maths Schools''', is a collection of six non-fee payment secondary education schools located in three provinces in [[South Africa]]. The first LEAP school opened in 2004 in rented premises in Observatory, [[Cape Town]] and served mainly, learners from the [[township]] of [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]].&lt;ref name="History of LEAP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leapschool.org.za/history-of-leap/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141110010101/http://leapschool.org.za/history%2Dof%2Dleap/|title = History of LEAP|accessdate = 10 November 2014|archivedate=10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an independent school, LEAP is mainly founded by South African Corporates with limited subsidies from the [[South African Department of Education|Department of Basic Education]].

==History==

===Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) ===

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

Bonisanani Mtshekisa&lt;ref name="Never Give Up"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mtshekisa|first1=Bonisanani|title=Never Give Up|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is LEAP’s first university graduate. He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''magnetosheath''' is the region of space between the [[magnetopause]] and the [[bow shock]] of a [[planet|planet's]] [[magnetosphere]]. The regularly organized [[magnetic field]] generated by the planet becomes weak and irregular in the magnetosheath due to interaction with the incoming [[solar wind]], and is incapable of fully deflecting the highly [[charged particle]]s. The density of the particles in this region is considerably lower than what is found beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the [[magnetopause]], and can be considered a transitory state.

[[Image:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, showing the relative position of the magnetosheath]]

Scientific research into the exact nature of the magnetosheath has been limited due to a longstanding misconception that it was a simple byproduct of the bow shock/magnetopause interaction and had no inherently important properties of its own.  Recent studies indicate, however, that the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow that may play an important role in the structure of the bow shock and the magnetopause, and may help to dictate the flow of energetic particles across those boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Earth]]'s magnetosheath typically occupies the region of space approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind ([[Sun]]-facing) side of the planet, extending significantly farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind.  The exact location and width of the magnetosheath does depend on variables such as [[Solar variation|solar activity]].

Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates "masculism" from "masculinism", defining the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; 
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes the two terms, with masculism expressing the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme ": une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = “Masculinism”: a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |url =https://doi.org/10.7202/039213ar |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures reducing sexism against women have increased it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in his book ''The Failure of Feminism'', describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism": "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;Christensen, Ferrell (2005), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WbkSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA562 Masculism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Honderich | editor-first = Ted | title = The Oxford companion to philosophy |pages=562&amp;ndash;563 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9780199264797 }}

[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, have come to examine oppression in a masculist society also from the perspectives of men, many of whom are also subjected by that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;Hoogensen, Gunhild; Solheim, Bruce Olav (2006), "[https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21 Women in theory and practice]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Hoogensen | editor-first1 = Gunhild | editor-last2 = Solheim | editor-first2 = Bruce Olav |title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|year=2006|page=21|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275981907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

==Topic areas of interest==
{{main|Men's rights movement}}

===Education and employment===
Many masculists oppose co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools better promote the well-being of boys.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"&gt;

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Masculist [[Warren Farrell]] has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===
{{Violence against men}}
{{See also|Violence against men}}

Masculists cite higher rates of suicide in men than women.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Masculists express concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrell | first = Warren | author-link = Warren Farrell | title = [[The Myth of Male Power|The myth of male power: why men are the disposable sex]] | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780425181447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also express concern about violence against men being ignored or minimized in comparison to violence against women,&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mvulane | first = Zama | title = Do men suffer spousal abuse? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221033948/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | archive-date = February 21, 2009 | url = http://www.iol.co.za:80/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081125064002133C731559&amp;set_id= | work = [[Cape Times]] | via = [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]] | location = South Africa | page = 12 | date = November 25, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; some asserting gender symmetry in [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Another of their concerns is that traditional assumptions of female innocence or sympathy for women, termed [[benevolent sexism]], may lead to unequal penalties for women and men who commit similar crimes,&lt;ref name="MYTH" /&gt; to lack of sympathy for male victims in [[domestic violence]] cases, and to dismissal of female-on-male [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual harassment]] cases.

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
According to [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], "Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more likely in most parts of the world for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. He argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title = Just who are men's rights activists? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 | work = [[BBC News Online#Features|BBC News Magazine]] | date = May 2, 2012 | access-date = May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South African masculist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has seen a resurgence of masculist Christian evangelical groups, led by two complementary men's and women's movements, the Mighty Men movement and the Worthy Women movement.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 141&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Project MUSE]] | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of Muscular Christianity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Muscular Christianity in contemporary South Africa: The case of the Mighty Men Conference | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;9 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = July 2015 | url = https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/2945/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement does not lead discussions about institutionalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Race, whiteness and transformation in the Promise Keepers America and the Mighty Men Conference: A comparative analysis | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2016 | url = http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/3476/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars argue that the movement's lack of attention to women's rights and their historical struggle with racial equality makes it a threat to women and to the stability of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholar Miranda Pillay argues that the Mighty Men movement appeal lies in its resistance to gender equality as incompatible with Christian values, and in raising patriarchy to a "hyper-normative status," beyond challenge by other claims to power.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, Miranda (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is a women's auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader is Gretha Wiid. She blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to their men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 A movement seeking to embody support of patriarchal structures and patterns in church and society: Gertha Wiid's Worthy Women movement]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 86&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her success is attributed to her balancing claims that God created the gender hierarchy, but that women are no less valuable than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nortjé-Meyer | first = Lilly | title = A critical analysis of Gretha Wiid’s sex ideology and her biblical hermeneutics | journal = Verbum et Ecclesia | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2011 | url = http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/472/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoration of traditional gender roles relieves existential anxiety in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"/&gt;

===Feminism===
Some masculinists have been described as explicitly antifeminist by feminist activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, "the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Some masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father's rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in "tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women's shelters and women's centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Janet M. | last2 = Borrelli | first2 = Maryanne | title = The other elites: Women, politics, and power in the Executive Branch | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781555879716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

'''Melody type''' or '''type-melody'''&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley. ''Western Plainchant. A Handbook''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;331–33.&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of [[melody|melodic]] formulas, [[figure (music)|figures]], and [[melodic pattern|patterns]].

== Term and typical meanings ==
"Melody type" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical [[Mode (music)|modes]], according to [[Harold Powers|Harold Powers']] seminal article "Mode" in the first edition of the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{harv|Powers|1980|loc=12:376–77, 379, et passim}}.

Melody types are used in the [[musical composition|composition]] of an enormous variety of [[music]], especially [[music of Asia|non-Western]] and [[early music|early Western music]]. Such music is generally composed by a process of [[centonization]], either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.

"Melody type" as used by the ethmnomusicologist [[Mark Slobin|Mark]] {{harvtxt|Slobin|1982|loc=186}}&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark (1982). ''Tenement Songs: The Popular Music of the Jewish Immigrants''. Music in American Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-00893-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a "group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic [[rhythm]]ic and melodic contours or patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Koskoff, Ellen (2000). ''Music in Lubavitcher Life'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press), p.&amp;nbsp;86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-02591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western [[musical scale|scale]]s, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible [[pitch (music)|pitches]], since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for [[improvisation]]. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

{{quote|On one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite—a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example&amp;nbsp;... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships.&lt;br/&gt; On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a [[musical mode|mode]]. Here the melody type is similar to a [[Gregorian mode|church mode]]: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones.&lt;br/&gt; ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.|May (1983)&lt;ref&gt;May, Elizabeth (1983). ''Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction, Part 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;274. {{ISBN|978-0-520-04778-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|A melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, [[ornament (music)|ornaments]], and other details. Melody types are found mostly in the music of ancient peoples—the Greeks, Hebrews, and others—and of Eastern peoples—the Arabs, Persians (Iranians), Indians, and others. For...example...[[raga]].|Ammer (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine (2004). "Melody type", ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;238. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5266-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Transcribed from the South-French tonary of the 10th century (Ms.: F-Pn lat.&amp;nbsp;1121, fol.&amp;nbsp;201v-205v). Pseudo-liturgical verses with initial numerals (''primum..., secundum..., tertia...'' etc.) helped singers to associate a current model with a 'real' chant (such as antiphon) of the same tone. These type-melodies were probably conceived as didactic, to adjust ear for typical melodic formulae, reciting tones, finals etc. They should not be confused with psalm tones, which represent an exact scheme for modulating psalms and canticles.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant: A Handbook'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1993): pp.&amp;nbsp;58-69 and pp.&amp;nbsp;331-335; this handbook is itself a summary of specialized studies of intonation formulas by Michel Huglo, Terence Bailey, [[Bruno Stäblein]], and many others referred to at pp.&amp;nbsp;58 and 325 et passim.

==Extra-musical implications==
In most cases, these melody types are associated with extra-musical implications, particularly [[emotion]]s (see Indian [[rasa (art)|rasa]], for instance). They are also often associated with certain times. For example, most [[raga]]s are associated with a certain time of day, or a [[wayang]] performance in Java implies a certain succession of [[pathet]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">'''[[Microarchitecture]] simulation''' is an important technique in [[computer architecture]] research and [[computer science]] education. It is a tool for modeling the design and behavior of a [[microprocessor]] and its components, such as the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], [[CPU cache|cache memory]], [[control unit]], and data path, among others. The simulation allows researchers to explore the design space as well as to evaluate the performance and efficiency of novel microarchitecture features. For example, several microarchitecture components, such as [[branch predictors]], [[re-order buffer]], and [[trace cache]], went through numerous simulation cycles before they become common components in contemporary microprocessors of today. In addition, the simulation also enables educators to teach computer organization and architecture courses with hand-on experiences.

For system-level simulation of computer hardware, please refer to the [[full system simulation]].

==Classification==
Microarchitecture simulation can be classified into multiple categories according to input types and level of details. Specifically, the input can be a trace collected from an execution of program on a real microprocessor (so called trace-driven simulation) or a program itself (so called execution-driven simulation). 

A trace-driven simulation&lt;ref&gt;Uhlig, R. A., &amp; Mudge, T. N. (2004). Trace-Driven Memory Simulation: A Survey. ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 29(2), 128-170.&lt;/ref&gt; reads a fixed sequence of trace records from a file as an input. These trace records usually represent memory references, branch outcomes, or specific machine instructions, among others. While a trace-driven simulation is known to be comparatively fast and its results are highly reproducible, it also requires a very large storage space. On the other hand, an execution-driven simulation&lt;ref&gt;Burger, D., &amp; Austin, T. M. (1997). The Simplescalar Tool Set Version 2.0. ''Computer Architecture News'', 25(3), 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt; reads a program and simulates the execution of machine instructions on the fly. A program file is typically several magnitudes smaller than a trace file. However, the execution-driven simulation is much slower than the trace-driven simulation because it has to process each instruction one-by-one and update all statuses of the microarchitecture components involved. Thus, the selection of input types for simulation is a trade-off between space and time. In particular, a very detailed trace for a highly accurate simulation requires a very large storage space, whereas a very accurate execution-driven simulation takes a very long time to execute all instructions in the program. 

Apart from input types, the level of details can also be used to classify the simulation. In particular, a piece of software that simulates a microprocessor executing a program on a cycle-by-cycle basis is known as [[cycle-accurate simulator]], whereas [[instruction set simulator]] only models the execution of a program on a microprocessor through the eyes of an instruction scheduler along with a coarse timing of instruction execution. Most computer science classes in computer architecture with hand-on experiences adopt the instruction set simulators as tools for teaching, whereas the cycle-accurate simulators are deployed mostly for research projects due to both complexities and resource consumption.

==Usages==
Microarchitecture simulators are deployed for a variety of purposes. It allows researchers to evaluate their ideas without the need to fabricate a real microprocessor chip, which is both expensive and time consuming. For instance, simulating a microprocessor with thousand of cores along with multiple levels of cache memory incurs very little cost when comparing with the fabrication of a prototyping chip. The researchers can also play with several configurations of the cache hierarchy using different cache models in the simulator instead of having to fabricate a new chip every time they want to test something different.

Another usage of the microarchitecture simulator is in education.&lt;ref&gt;Skadron, K. (1996). A Microprocessor Survey Course for Learning Advanced Computer Architecture. In Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGCSE Conference, 152-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a course in computer architecture teaches students many different microprocessor's features and its architectures, the microarchitecture simulator is ideal for modeling and experimenting with different features and architectures over the course of a semester. For example, students may start with a microarchitecture simulator that models a simple microprocessor design at the beginning of a semester. As the semester progresses, additional features, such as [[instruction pipelining]], [[register renaming]], [[reservation stations]], [[out-of-order execution]], and [[scoreboarding]], can be modeled and added to the simulator as they are introduced in the classroom. Microarchitecture simulator provides the flexibility of reconfiguration and testing with minimal costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. 
# '''“The [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Geidai Connection]],”''' a group of artists around [[Kōji Enokura]] and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. 
# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

'''Phthora nenano''' ([[Medieval Greek]]: {{lang|grc|φθορά νενανῶ}}, also νενανὼ) is the name of one of the two "extra" modes in the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[Octoechos]]—an eight mode system, which was proclaimed by a synod of 792. The phthorai nenano and [[Nana (echos)|nana]] were favoured by composers at the [[Mar Saba|Monastery Agios Sabas]], near Jerusalem, while hymnographers at the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Stoudiou-Monastery]] obviously preferred the diatonic mele.

==The ''phthora nenano'' as part of the Hagiopolitan ''octoechos''==
Today the system of eight diatonic modes and two ''[[phthora (music)|phthorai]]'' ("destroyers") is regarded as the modal system of [[Byzantine music|Byzantine chant]], and during the eighth century it became also model for the Latin ''[[Tonary|tonaries]]''—introductions into a proper diatonic eight mode system and its psalmody, created by Frankish cantores during the Carolinigian reform.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001]]) compared the Greek and the Latin octoechos and found, that a modal classification of Gregorian chant according to the octoechos was analytically deduced a posteriori.&lt;/ref&gt; While φθορά νενανῶ was often called "chromatic", the second ''phthora'' was named "[[nana (echos)|nana]]" (gr. φθορά νανὰ) and called "enharmonic", the names were simply taken from the syllables used for the intonation ([[enechema]]).  The two ''phthorai'' were regarded as two proper modes, but also used as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] or [[alteration (music)|alteration]] signs. Within the diatonic modes of the [[octoechos]] they cause a change into another ([[Tetrachord|''chromatic'' or ''enharmonic'']]) genus (''[[metabole|metavoli]] kata genon'').&lt;ref&gt;See Barbera's entry "[[#Bar11|Metabolē]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest description of phthora nenano and of the eight mode system ([[octoechos]]) can be found in the ''Hagiopolites'' treatise which is known in a complete form through a fourteenth-century manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, fonds grec, ms. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise itself can be dated back to the ninth century, when it introduced the book of ''tropologion,'' a collection of [[Troparion|troparic]] and [[Heirmologion|heirmologic]] hymns which was ordered according to the eight-week cycle of the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|octoechos]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jeffery ([[#Jef01|2001]]), Christian Hannick &amp; Gerda Wolfram ([[#Ero97|1997]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The first paragraph of the treatise maintains, that it was written by [[John of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John of Damascus]] and [[Cosmas of Maiuma|Cosmas]] entered the [[Mar Saba|Lavra Agios Sabas]] about 700, after the reform was already established by a synodal decree in 692, and certain passages paraphrases polemics against the 16 echoi of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite ([[#Ras83|Raasted 1983]], 16—§8, [[#Jef01|Jeffery 2001]], 186f).&lt;/ref&gt; The hymns of the ''tropologion'' provided the melodic models of one mode called ''[[echos]]'' (gr. ἦχος), and models for the ''phthora nenano'' appeared in some mele of certain ''echoi'' like ''protos'' and ''plagios devteros''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the songs in this book eight Echoi are said to be necessary. But this is not true and should be rejected. In fact the Plagios of Deuteros is mostly sung as Mesos Deuteros—e.g. «{{lang|grc|Νίκην ἔχων Χριστὲ}}», the «{{lang|grc|Σὲ ἐπὶ τῶν ὑδάτων}}» and other pieces written by Master Cosmas and Master John of Damascus "from the Mousike". (If, however, you try to sing the compositions of Master Joseph and others "with the Mousike", they will not fit, having not been composed "according to the Mousike"). Similarly the Plagios of Tetartos is mostly sung as Mesos Tetartos like over «{{lang|grc|Σταυρὸν χαράξας Μωσῆς}}» and many others. For these cases we can see that ten Echoi are used (for the repertory of this book) and not eight, only.&lt;ref&gt;Hagiopolites ([[#Ras83|Raasted 1983]], 11).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Phthora Nenano.png|thumb|center|400px|alt=Phthora Nenano (φθορά νενανὼ) within the modal intonation of the Plagal Devteros Echos (ἦχος πλάγιος τοῦ δευτέρου)|Phthora Nenano (φθορά νενανὼ) within the [[enechema]] of the plagal devteros echos (ἦχος πλάγιος τοῦ δευτέρου) makes a mesos devteros — transcription according to the [[#Ero97|dialogue treatise]] (Mount Athos, [[Dionysiou monastery]], Ms. 570, f. 21v).]]

The author of the treatise wrote obviously during or after the time of [[Joseph the Confessor|Joseph]] and his brother [[Theodore the Studite]], when the use the mesos forms, phthorai nenano and [[Nana (echos)|nana]] were no longer popular. The word "mousike" ({{lang|grc|μουσική}}) referred an autochthonous theory during the 8th century used by the generation of John of Damascus and [[Cosmas of Maiuma]] at [[Mar Saba]], because it was independent from ancient Greek music.&lt;ref&gt;In the same way it was used by authors of Arabic treatises who referred to composers who avoided and others who liked the use of certain exotic tunes, while ancient Greek theorists  did refer to older methods of composition.&lt;/ref&gt; But it seems that it was regarded as inappropriate to use these phthorai for the hymn melodies composed by Joseph and other hymns composed since the ninth century, since they must have preferred the diatonic octoechos based on the kyrios and the plagios instead of the mesoi.

The concept of ''phthora'' in the Hagiopolites was less concerned that the Nenano and [[Nana (echos)|Nana]] were somehow bridges between the modes. As an introduction of the tropologion it had to integrate the mele composed in these phthorai within the octoechos order and its weekly cycles. Since they had their own mele and compositions like the other echoi, they were subordinated to the eight diatonic echoi according to the pitches or degrees of the mode (''phthongoi'') of their cadences.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|φθοραὶ δὲ ὠνομασθήσαν, ὅτι ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων ἤχων  πᾶρχονται, τελειοῦνται δὲ εἰς ἑτέρων ἤχων φθογγὰς αἱ θέσεις αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ  ποτελέσματα}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They were called Phthorai (i.e. destroyers), because they begin from their own Echoi, but the thesis of their cadences and formulas are on notes (''phthongoi'') from other Echoi.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted according Jørgen Raasted ([[#Ras83|1983]], 42f—§34) with a slightly modified translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They had to be classified according to a certain echos of the eight-week cycle by adding the intonation "nenano" to the intonation of the main diatonic echos (usually abbreviated by a modal signature). For example, the intonation formula of echos plagios devteros (E) could be followed by the intonation of nenano which leads to the echos protos (a), as a kind of "mesos devteros", which lies in between the finalis of the kyrios (b natural) and the one of its plagios (E). Usually the diatonic kyrios protos (a) could end on its plagios (D) in the diatonic genus, but the chromatic phthora nenano makes it end in the plagios devteros (E).

== The use of phthora nenano in the psaltic art ==

In the period of the [[Papadic Octoechos|psaltic art]] (gr. ψαλτική τέχνη, "the art of chant", 1261-1750) the Late Byzantine Notation used four additional phthorai for each mode, including the eight diatonic ''echoi'', in order to indicate the precise moment of a transposition (''metavoli kata tonon'').&lt;ref&gt;See Barbera's entry "[[#Bar11|Metabolē]]" (New Grove Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt; The former system of sixteen echoi (4 kyrioi, 4 plagioi, 4 mesoi, and 4 phthorai) which was still used in the old books of the cathedral rite ([[asmatikon]], [[kontakarion]], etc.), was replaced by the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its two phthorai. The new book ''akolouthiai'' which replaced the former book and established a mixed rite in Constantinople, introduced into eight diatonic echoi and two phthorai. In rather soloistic chant genres, the ''devteros echoi'' were turned into the chromatic genus by an abundant use of the ''phthora nenano''.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathios Makris ([[#Mak05|2005]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it became necessary to distinguish between the proper echos and its phthora, nenano and nana as "extra modes", and their use for temporary changes within the melos of a certain diatonic echos.

=== The use of six phthorai for all of the ten Hagiopolitan echoi ===

In his theoretical treatise about ''psaltic art'' and in response to the "wrong ideas" that some singers already had some years after the conquest of [[Constantinople]] (1458), the famous Maïstoros [[Manuel Chrysaphes]] introduced not only into the two phthorai nenano and nana, but also into four phthorai which bind the melos to the diatonic echoi of protos, devteros, tritos, and tetartos.

[[File:Phthorai.jpg|thumb|center|400px|List of 7 phthorai used for transposition in a 17th-century Papadike ([[British Library|GB-Lbl]] Ms. [[#Harley5544|Harley 5544]], f. 5v).]]

All six phthora, two of them belonged to the phthora nenano (the phthora of nenano and the one of plagios devteros), could dissolve the former melos and bind it to the melos of the following echos defined by the next medial signature. The diatonic phthora was no longer the destruction of the diatonic modes and its genus, melos, and its tonal system, it could change each mode and its finalis into another echos by a simple transposition. Hence, the list of phthorai mentioned in each Papadikai, was simply a catalogue of transposition signs, which were written over that neume where the transposition has to be done.

=== Phthora nenano and the plagal second echos ===

In that respect phthora nenano, as well as nana, stuck out, because within their own melos they were both directed to certain other echoi.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|ὅταν δὲ τεθῇ καὶ εἰς ἄλλου ἤχου μέλος, ποιεῖ μέλος ἴδιον παρ’ ὅ ποιοῦσιν αἱ ἄλλαι φθοραὶ καὶ ἡ κατάληξις ταύτης οὐ γίνεται εἰς ἄλλον ἦχον ποτέ, εἰ μὴ εἰς τὸν πλάγιον δευτέρου. εἰ δὲ θήσει τις ταύτην τὴν φθορὰν καὶ οὐ καταλήξει εἰς πλάγιον δευτέρου, ἄλλ’ εἰς ἕτερον ἦχον, τοῦτο οὐκ ἔστιν ἔντεχνον· προείπομεν γάρ, ὅτι ἔστιν  πὸ παραλλαγῶν ἡ αὐτὴ πρῶτος ἦχος·}}&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Conomos ([[#Con85|1985]], 64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever it stands in the melody [{{lang|grc|μέλος}}] of another echos, it creates its own melody [{{lang|grc|μέλος}}] and cadence [{{lang|grc|κατάληξις}}] which the other phthorai cannot do, and its resolution never closes into another mode apart from the plagios devteros. If one uses this phthora and it does not resolve [{{lang|grc|θήσει}}] into the echos plagios devteros but into another mode, this is not artistic [{{lang|grc|ἔντεχνον}}]; for we said before that this is the echos protos by parallage [{{lang|grc|παραλλαγή}}].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the psaltic art itself which moved the ''phthongos'' of plagios devteros to the one of plagios protos. It is possible, that the phthora of plagios devteros was needed to change again into diatonic genus. According to the New Method (since 1814) echos plagios devteros was always chromatic and based on the phthongos of echos protos, memorised as {{lang|grc|πα}}. This was Chrysanthos' way to understand Manuel Chrysaphes—probably a contemporary way, since the 17th-century Papadike introduced a seventh phthora for plagios protos.

{{anchor|parallage}}[[File:ChrysanthosPlagiosDevteros.png|thumb|center|500px|Chrysanthos' ''parallage'' of ''echos plagios devteros'' as ''phthora nenano'' in the parallage of ''echos protos'' and  its pentachord ([[#Chr1832|1832]], 107, 109).]]

According to the rules of psaltic art phthora nenano could connect the phthongoi devteros and protos as well as protos and tetartos, as can be seen from the solfège diagram called the "parallage of John Plousiadenos" (see the first X in the first row around the centre of the enechema of phthora nenano).

[[File:Parallage Ioannis Plousiadinos.jpg|center|thumb|500px|"{{lang|grc|ἡ σοφωτάτη παραλλαγὴ κυρίου Ἰωάννου Ἰερέως τοῦ Πλουσιαδηνοῦ}}" in an 18th-century manuscript (Athos, [[Docheiariou monastery]], Ms. 319, fol. 18v)]]

Despite this possibility Manuel Chrysaphes insisted, that phthora nenano and its chromatic melos has always to be resolved as plagios devteros, any other echos would be against the rules of psaltic art. The living tradition today still respects this rule, since phthongos of the plagios devteros ({{lang|grc|πλβ᾽}}) has become the same like plagios protos ({{lang|grc|πλα᾽}}): {{lang|grc|πα}} (D).

=== The early Persian and Latin reception ===

Already in the thirteenth century, there were interval descriptions in Latin and Arabic treatises which proved that the use of the chromatic phthora was common not only among Greek psaltes.

Quţb al-Dīn al-Shīrīz distinguished two ways of using the chromatic genus in parde hiğāzī, named after a region of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Iannis Zannos ([[#Zan94|1994]], 105f).&lt;/ref&gt; The exact proportions were used during changes to the diatonic genus. In both diatonic and chromatic divisions the ring finger fret of the [[oud]] keyboard was used. It had the proportion 22:21—between middle and ring finger fret—and was called after the Baghdadi [[oud]] player Zalzal. These are the proportions, presented as a division of a tetrachord using the proportions of 22:21 and 7:6:

12:11 x 7:6 x 22:21 = 4:3  (approximate intervals in cents:  151, 267, 80 = 498)

This Persian treatise is the earliest source which tried to measure the exact proportions of a chromatic mode, which can be compared with historical descriptions of phthora nenano.

In his voluminous music treatise [[Jerome of Moravia]] described that "Gallian cantores" used to mix the diatonic genus with chromatic and the enharmonic, despite the use of the two latter were excluded according to Latin theorists:&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Gerlach ([[#Ger10|2010]], 130) in his discussion of the earliest sources for the practice of phthora nenano pointed out, that Jerome who had an exceptional knowledge of Greek music theory, described the use of chromaticism among Parisian singers as a kind of phthora nenano.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gaudent insuper, cum modum organicum notis ecclesiasticis admiscent, quod etiam non abjicit primus modus, necnon et de admixtione modorum duorum generum relictorum. Nam diesim enharmonicam et trihemitonium chromaticum generi diatonico associant. Semitonium loco toni et e converso commutant, in quo quidem a cunctis nationibus in cantu discordant.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Cserba ([[#Cse35|1935]], ii:187).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Especially when they mix the ecclesiastical chant with the organum mode, they like not only to abandon the first mode [simple plainchant in monophonic realization?], but the confusion of both [plainchant and ars organi] includes another [confusion of the diatonic] with the other genera, because they associate the enharmonic diesis and the chromatic trihemitonium with the diatonic genus. They replace the semitonium by the tonus and vice versa, in doing so they differ from the other nations, as far as chant is concerned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the seventies of the thirteenth century Jerome met the famous singers in Paris who were well skilled in the artistic performance of ''[[Organum|ars organi]],'' which is evident by the chant manuscripts of the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, of the Abbey Saint-Denis, and of the [[Notre Dame school]]. Despite the fact that no other Latin treatise ever mentioned that the singers were allowed to use enharmonic or chromatic intervals, and certainly not the transposition practice which was used sometimes by Greek psaltes, they obviously felt free enough to use both during the improvisation of [[organum]]—and probably, they became so familiar with the described enharmonic chromaticism, that they even used it during the monophonic performance of plainchant. Jerome as an educated listener regarded it as an unallowed "confusion" between monophonic and polyphonic performance style. Whatever was his opinion about the performance style of Parisian cantores, the detailed description fit well to the use of the phthora nenano as an "echos kratema", as it was mentioned in the later Greek treatises after the [[Byzantine Empire#Rise of the Ottomans and fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]].

=== The phthora nenano as kyrios echos and echos kratema ===

According to a [[Papadic Octoechos|Papadike]] treatise in a sixteenth-century manuscript (Athens, [[National Library of Greece|National Library]], Ms. 899 [EBE 899], fol.3f), the anonymous author even argues that phthorai nenano and nana are rather independent modes than phthorai, because singers as well as composers can create whole [[Kratematarion|kratemata]] out of them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|Εἰσὶ δὲ καὶ φθοραὶ δύο, αἵτινες ψάλλονται σὺν αὐτοῖς, τὸ νανὰ καὶ τὸ νενανὼ. Εἰσί δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι φθοραὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἤχων ἀλλοὐκ εἰσὶ τέλειαι ὡς αὗται. Εκεῖναι γὰρ δεικνύουσιν ἐναλλαγὴν μερικὴν ἀπὸ ἤχου εἰς ἕτερονἶ αὐταὶ δὲ τέλειαι οὖσαι ἔχουσι καὶ κρατήματα ποινθέντα παρὰ τῶν κατὰ καιροὺς ποιντῶν ὡς εἰς κυρίους ἤχους, καὶ εἰκότως ἄν &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;τις&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; καλέσειεν αὐτὰς τελείους ἤχους καὶ οὐ φθορὰς}}.&lt;ref&gt;Citation according Iannis Zannos ([[#Zan94|1994]], 110f).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two phthorai which can be sung as those [of the Octoechos]: νανὰ and νενανὼ. There are also the phthorai of the other &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;kyrioi&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; echoi, but those are not as perfect &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;they have no proper melos like nana and nenano?&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, because they just cause a temporary transition [{{lang|grc|ἐναλλαγή μερική}}] from one to another echos, while the former have been used by composers of various epochs to create kratemata like they were &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;independent&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; kyrioi echoi. Hence, it is justified to call them rather "perfect echoi" than just "phthorai".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kratematarion|Kratemata]] were longer sections sung with abstract syllables in a faster tempo. As a disgression used within other forms in papadic or [[Kalophonia|kalophonic]] chant genres—soloistic like [[Cherubikon|cherubim chant]] or a [[sticheron]] kalophonikon. From a composer's point of view who composed within the mele of the [[Papadic Octoechos|octoechos]], a kratema could not only recapitulate the modal structure of its model, but also create a change into another (chromatic or enharmonic) genus. If a composer or [[protopsaltes]] realised a traditional model of a [[cherubikon]] or [[koinonikon]] within the melos of echos protos, the phthora nenano will always end the form of the kratema in echos plagios devteros, only then the singer could find a way back to the main echos. In the later case the kratema was composed so perfectly in the proper melos of phthora nenano, that it could be performed as a separate composition of its own, as they were already separated compositions in the simpler genres like the troparion and the heirmologic odes of the canon since the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Listen to Chourmouzios' transcription of [[John Koukouzeles]]' [[#kratema|kratema]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriel Hieromonachus]] (mid fifteenth century) already mentioned that the "nenano phone"—the characteristic step (interval) of nenano—seemed to be in some way halved. On folio 5 verso of the quoted treatise (EBE 899), the author gave a similar description of the intervals used with the intonation formula νε–να–νὼ, and it fitted very well to the description that Jerome gave 300 years ago while he was listening to Parisian singers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἄκουσον γὰρ τὴν φθορὰν, ὅπως λέγεται: Τότε λέγεται φθορὰ, ὅταν τῆς φωνῆς τὸ ἥμιου εἴπης ἐν ταῖς κατιούσαις, (ἢ κατ’ ἀκριφολογίαν τὸ τρίτον, ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἀνιούσαις) μίαν καὶ ἥμισυ, ὥσπερ εἰς τὸ νενανώ. Ἄκουσον γὰρ:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;center&gt;νε &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ἴσον&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—να &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;δικεντήματα&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—να &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ὀλίγον&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—νω &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ὀλίγον με τῇ διπλῇ&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Αὕτη ἡ φθορὰ εἰς τὰς ἀνιούσας. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ εἶπε τοῦ νω τὴν φωνὴν τὴν ἥμισυ εἰς τὸ να}}.&lt;ref&gt;Citation according Zannos ([[#Zan94|1994]], 112). The folio 5 verso of the manuscript was reproduced by Eustathios Makris in his article ([[#Mak05|2005]], 4—fig.1), and so he proved that the little addition about the descending intonation cannot be found as quoted by Ioannis Zannos (probably this was the eighteenth-century redaction in Cod. Athos, Xeropotamou 317), so it is written here in rectangular brackets. In fact the standard intonation given in EBE 899 is just ascending.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please note, what is called "phthora": phthora is called, if you make a half phonic step in descending [direction], (or more precisely a third of it, while [the second interval] has an ascending) one and a half, as in nenano. Listen:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;center&gt;{{lang|grc|νε}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ison&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—{{lang|grc|να}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;dikentimata: small tone&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—{{lang|grc|να}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;oligon: one and a half of the great tone&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—{{lang|grc|νὼ}} &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;oligon with diple: diesis or quarter tone&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the intonation of phthora which is ascending. Concerning the final phonic step &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;which was a third of tonus in a descending melos], half of it is now part of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;second&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; να step [{{lang|grc|φωνή}}] and the rest &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;interval is sung&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on νω!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The upper small tone leading to the final note of the protos, has a slightly different intonation with respect to the melodic movement, at least according to the practice among educated psaltes of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the eighteenth century. But Gabriel Hieromonachos described already in the fifteenth century, that the singers tend to stray away from their original intonation while they were singing the melos of phthora nenano:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|Ὁποπαν γὰρ ψάλλομεν νενανὼ μέλος, οὐκ εἰς ἣν ήρξάμεθα καὶ τελευτῶμεν φωνήν, ἀλλὰ σκοπῶν εὑρήσεις ἐπὶ τὸ κάτω μάλλον ἐρχομένους ἡμᾶς. Αἴτιον δὲ ἡ τοῦ νενανὼ φονή· αὕτη γὰρ ἡμίσεια δοκεῖ πως εἶναι, εἰ καὶ ἡμῖν ἀγνοεῖται· ἄλλως θ' ὅτι ἀσθενεῖς ἐκφέρομεν τὰς τοῦ νενανὼ ἀνιούσας φωνάς, ἵνα ἡ τοῦ νενανὼ ἰδέα χρωματισθῇ τὰς δὲ κατιούσας σῴας, καὶ ἐκ τούτου συμβαίνει τὸ μέλος ὑποχαλᾶν}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hannick &amp; Gerda Wolfram ([[#Gab85|1985]], 98—lines 680-86).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because when we sing a nenano melody, we don’t end on the tone, from which we started, but if you look at it closer, you will find that we come down to a somewhat lower pitch. The reason for this is the nenano interval; for it seems to be in some way halved, even if we are not aware of it; in other words, we perform the nenano intervals weakly in upward direction, in order to give the characteristic colour of nenano, but in downward direction [we perform them] correctly, and this causes the melody to get out of tune.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by Eustathios Makris ([[#Mak05|2005]], 3f).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Actual usage and meaning==

Later use of the [[enechema]] (initial incantation formula) of nenano as well as the phthora (alteration and transposition sign) of nenano in manuscripts makes it clear that it is associated with the main form of the second plagal mode as it survives in the current practice of Byzantine ([[Greek Orthodox]]) chant. Furthermore, the phthora sign of nenano has survived in the nineteenth-century neo-Byzantine notation system which is still used to switch between a diatonic and chromatic intonation of the tetrachord one fourth below.

=== Chrysanthos' exegesis of the phthora nenano ===
In the chapter "About apechemata", Chrysanthos quoted the medieval apechema of the phthora nenano as a chromatic tetrachord between the pitch (phthongos) of plagios devteros and protos.

[[File:Nenano.jpg|thumb|center|200px|The medieval {{lang|grc|φθορά νενανὼ}}]]

This intonation formulas avoids the enharmonic step ([[diesis]]) which is expected between tetartos (δ') and protos (α').

His exegesis of this short apechema sets the chromatic or enharmonic tetrachord between plagios protos (πλ α') and tetartos (δ'), so that the diesis lies between tritos (γ') and tetartos (δ'):

[[File:NenanoExegesis.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Chrysanthos' exegesis of the medieval apechema of phthora nenano ([[#Chr1832|Chrysanthos 1832]], 142—§317)]]

The common modern enechema places the tetrachord likewise:

=== Chrysanthos' exegeseis of the devteros echoi ===

==== The hard chromatic plagios devteros ====
[[File:PlagiosDevteros.jpg|thumb|center|300px|The medieval enechema of the diatonic echos plagios devteros ([[#Chr1832|Chrysanthos 1832]], 139)]]

Chrysanthos of Madytos offered following exegesis of the traditional [[enechema|echema]] {{lang|grc|νεανες}} which was originally diatonic, but it is currently sung with the chromatic nenano intonation (see {{lang|grc|νεχὲ ανὲς}} in [[#parallage|Chrysanthos' parallage]]).

[[File:ChrysanthosNenano.png|thumb|550px|center|Exegesis of the traditional intonation of the diatonic plagios echos of devteros (ἦχος πλάγιος τοῦ δευτέρου) in the melos of the phthora nenano ([[#Chr1832|Chrysanthos 1832]], 139—§314)]]

[[File:PlagiosDevterosmodern.jpg|thumb|center|300px|The current enechema of the chromatic echos plagios devteros ([[#Chr1832|Chrysanthos 1832]], 140—§314)]]

Chrysanthos' exegesis employed the concluding cadence formula of the chromatic plagios devteros which was obviously an exegesis based on psaltic rules, as Manual Chrysaphes had once mentioned them.

He described the correct intonation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;§. 245. {{lang|grc|Ἡ χρωματικὴ κλίμαξ, πα [βου ὕφεσις] [γα δίεσις] δι κε [ζω ὕφεσις] [νη δίεσις] Πα, σύγκειται ἀπὸ δύο τετράχορδα· ἐν ἑκατέρῳ δὲ τετραχόρδῳ κεῖνται τὰ ἡμίτονα οὕτως, ὥστε τὸ διάστημα πα βου εἶναι ἴσον μὲ τὸ κε ζω· τὸ δὲ βου γα εἶναι ἴσον μὲ τὸ ζω νη· καὶ τὸ γα δι εἶναι ἴσον μὲ τὸ νη Πα· καὶ ὅλον τὸ πα δι τετράχορδον εἶναι ἴσον μὲ τὸ κε Πα τετράχορδον. Εἶναι δὲ τὸ μὲν πα βου διάστημα ἴσον ἐλαχιστῳ τόνῳ· τὸ δὲ βου γα, τριημιτόνιον· καὶ τὸ γα δι, ἡμιτόνιον· ἤγουν ἴσον}} 3:12.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]], 106—§245).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The chromatic scale: D πα—[high E flat]—[high F sharp]—G δι—a κε—[high b flat]—[high c sharp]—d πα', consists of two tetrachords. In each tetrachords the hemitones are placed in a way, that the interval D πα—E βου [ὕφεσις] is the same as a κε—b ζω' [ὕφεσις], Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F sharp γα [δίεσις] is the same as b ζω' [ὕφεσις]—c sharp νη' [δίεσις], and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι is the same as c sharp νη' [δίεσις]—d πα', so that both tetarchords, D πα—G δ and a κε—d πα', are unisono. This means that the interval D πα—E βου [ὕφεσις] is unisono with the small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος), Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F sharp γα [δίεσις] with the trihemitone, and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι with the hemitone: 3:12—a quarter of the great tone (μείζων τόνος) [7+18+3=28].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite of this tradition modern music teachers tried to translate this sophisticated intonation on a modern piano keyboard as "a kind of gipsy-minor."&lt;ref&gt;According to this simplification a phthora of nenano is placed on δι, which in Western terms corresponds to the tone "G" (sol), then it indicates a chromatic tetrachord, approximated by the notes: '''D-high E flat-high F sharp-G'''. This is similar to the upper part of a G minor harmonic scale, or of the "Zigeunermoll" (gipsy-minor) scale. In other words, nenano is the prototype of the scale structure that includes an [[augmented second]]—which Hieronymus and Chrysanthos call more precise "trihemitone"—between two [[minor second]]s and that is nowadays one of the most well known clichés commonly associated with near eastern or middle eastern "oriental" musical color.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The soft chromatic kyrios devteros ====
In a very similar way—like the classical phthora nenano intonation—also the soft chromatic intonation of the echos devteros is represented as a kind of mesos devteros. Here according Chrysanthos of Madytos the exegesis of the traditional devteros intonation can be sung like this:

[[File:ChrysanthosExegesisDevteros.png|thumb|centre|750px|Exegesis of the traditional mesos devteros intonation as chromatic mesos ([[#Chr1832|Chrysanthos 1832]], 137-138—§310)]]

He explained that the intonation of the modern echos devteros was not based on tetraphonia, but on trichords or diphonia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;§. 244. {{lang|grc|Ἡ χρωματικὴ κλίμαξ νη [πα ὕφεσις] βου γα δι [κε ὕφεσις] ζω Νη σχηματίζει ὄχι τετράχορδα, ἀλλὰ τρίχορδα πάντῃ ὅμοια καὶ συνημμένα τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον·&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;center&gt;νη [πα ὕφεσις] βου, βου γα δι, δι [κε ὕφεσις] ζω, ζω νη Πα.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Αὕτη ἡ κλίμαξ ἀρχομένη ἀπὸ τοῦ δι, εἰμὲν πρόεισιν ἐπὶ τὸ βαρὺ, θέλει τὸ μὲν δι γα διάστημα τόνον μείζονα· τὸ δὲ γα βου τόνον ἐλάχιστον· τὸ δὲ βου πα, τόνον μείζονα· καὶ τὸ πα νη, τόνον ἐλάχιστον. Εἰδὲ πρόεισιν ἐπὶ τὸ ὀξὺ, θέλει τὸ μὲν δι κε διάστημα τόνον ἐλάχιστον· τὸ δὲ κε ζω, τόνον μείζονα· τὸ δὲ ζω νη, τόνον ἐλάχιστον· καὶ τὸ νη Πα, τόνον μείζονα. Ὥστε ταύτης τῆς χρωματικῆς κλίμακος μόνον οἱ βου γα δι φθόγγοι ταὐτίζονται μὲ τοὺς βου γα δι φθόγγους τῆς διατονικῆς κλίμακος· οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κινοῦνται. Διότι τὸ βου νη διάστημα κατὰ ταύτην μὲν τὴν κλίμακα περιέχει τόνους μείζονα καὶ ἐλάχιστον· κατὰ δὲ τὴν διατονικὴν κλίμακα περιέχει τόνους ἐλάσσονα καὶ μείζονα· ὁμοίως καὶ τὸ δι ζω διάστημα}}.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]], 105-106—§244).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The chromatic scale C νη—[D flat]—E βου—F γα—G δι—[a flat]—b ζω'—c νη' is not made of tetrachords, but of trichords which are absolutely equal and conjunct with each other—in this way:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;center&gt;C νη—[D flat]—E βου, E βου—F γα—G δι, G δι—[a flat]—b ζω', b ζω'—c νη'—d πα'&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the scale starts on G δι, and it moves towards the lower, the step G δι—F γα requests the interval of a great tone (μείζων τόνος) and the step F γα—E βου a small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος); likewise the step E βου—[D flat] πα [ὕφεσις] an interval of μείζων τόνος, and the step πα [ὕφεσις] [D flat]—C νη one of ἐλάχιστος τόνος. When the direction is towards the higher, the step G δι—[a flat] κε [ὕφεσις] requests the interval of a small tone and [a flat] κε [ὕφεσις]—b ζω' that of a great tone; likewise the step b ζω'—c νη' an interval of ἐλάχιστος τόνος, and the step c νη'—Cd πα one of μείζων τόνος. Among the ''phthongoi'' of this chromatic scale only the ''phthongoi'' βου, γα, and δι can be identified with the same ''phthongoi'' of the diatonic scale, while the others are moveable degrees of the mode. While this scale extends between E βου and C νη over one great and one small tone [12+7=19], the diatonic scale extends from the middle (ἐλάσσων τόνος) to the great tone (μείζων τόνος) [12+9=21], for the interval between G δι and b ζω' it is the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:ChrysanthosMesosDevteros.png|thumb|center|500px|Chrysanthos' parallage of ''echos devteros'' in the ''soft chromatic genus'' ([[#Chr1832|1832, pp. 106-108]])]]

=== Phthora nenano as an "Ottoman corruption" ===
Because of its early status as one of the two mysterious extra modes in the system, nenano has been subject of much attention in Byzantine and post-Byzantine music theory. Papadikai like the manuscript EBE 899 and other late Byzantine manuscripts associate nenano and nana with the chromatic and the [[enharmonic genus]], one of the three [[genus (music)|genera]] of tuning during [[Classical antiquity]] that fell into early misuse because of its complexity. If the phthora nenano was already chromatic during the 9th century, including the use of one enharmonic [[diesis]], is still a controversial issue, but medieval Arabic, Persian and Latin authors like Jerome of Moravia rather hint to the possibility that it was.

Greek music theoreticians such as [[Simon Karas]] continue up to the end of the twentieth century to regard the intonation nenano as "exotic," although they do not always agree, whether the echos plagios devteros intonation is hard or soft chromatic.&lt;ref&gt;Among [[Phanariotes]] Simon Karas ([[#Kar81|1981]]) has another explanation as Chrysanthos' trichordal concept of echos devteros which tried to integrate psaltic tradition to base the phthora on the phthongos plagios devteros ({{lang|grc|πλ β'}}). These different approaches make a historical explanation very difficult ([[#Mak05|Makris 2005]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous authors like the one of the 16th-century Papadike (EBE 899) maintained, that one of the minor tones in the tetrachord of nenano should be either smaller or larger than a tempered semitone, approaching the smallest interval of a third or a quarter of a tone. The banishment of instrumental musical practice and its theory from the tradition of Byzantine chant has made it very difficult to substantiate any such claims experimentally, and traditional singers use different intonations depending on their school. The only possible conclusions can be drawn indirectly and tentatively through comparisons with the tradition of Ottoman instrumental court music, which important church theoreticians such as the [[Kyrillos Marmarinos]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Tinos]] considered a necessary complement to liturgical chant.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Popescu-Județ and Adriana Şırlı ([[#Pop00|2000]]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ottoman court music and its theory are also complex and diverging versions of modes exist according to different schools, ethnic traditions or theorists. There, one encounters various versions of the "nenano" tetrachord, both with a narrow and with a wider minor second either at the top or at the bottom, depending on the interval structure of the scale beyond the two ends of the tetrachord.

Although the phthora nenano is already known as one of two additional phthorai used within the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|Hagiopolitan octoechos]], its chromaticism was often misunderstood as a late corruption of Byzantine chant during the Ottoman Empire, but recent comparisons with medieval Arabic treatises proved that this exchange can dated back to a much earlier period, when Arab music was created as a synthesis of Persian music and Byzantine chant of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard Neubauer ([[#Neu98|1998]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

''From the Talmud and Hebraica'', Vol. 1 (reprint). New York, New York: Cosimo. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-1-60206-406-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David Noel; editor. 2000. ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., p. 990. {{ISBN|0-8028-2400-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the biblical name apparently given to a certain part of a settlement or city that is elevated from its surroundings, and probably means fortified hill or risen area. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the Ophel refers to a specific part in two cities: the extended [[City of David]] (the oldest part of [[Jerusalem]]), as in the [[Book of Chronicles]] and the [[Book of Nehemiah]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 27:3; 33:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 3:26; 11:21}}), and at [[Samaria]], the ancient capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], mentioned in the [[Books of Kings|Second Book of Kings]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Book of Kings 5:24}}). The [[Mesha Stele]] is the only extra-biblical source using the word, also in connection to a fortified area.

==Meaning of the term==
''Ophel'', with the definite article ''ha-ophel'', is a [[common noun]] known from two [[Semitic languages|Ancient Semitic languages]], [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Moab#Language|Moabitic]].&lt;ref name="ISBE"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |editor=[[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr]] |encyclopedia= [[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]] |title=Ophel |author=Masterman, Ernest William Gurney |edition=first |year=1915 |publisher=Howard-Severance Co. |location=Chicago |url= http://biblehub.com/topical/o/ophel.htm |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a place name or description it appears several times in the Hebrew Bible and once on the Mesha Stele from [[Moab]].&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; There is no ultimate agreement as to its exact meaning, and scholars have long been trying to deduce it from the different contexts it appears in.&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; When used as a common noun, it has been translated as "tumors" ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 5:9, 12; 6:5}}), and in a verbal form it was taken to mean "puffed up" ({{Bibleref2|Habakkuk 2:4}}), this indicating that the root might be associated with "swelling".&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; When referring to a place, it seems from the context to mean either hill, or fortified place, or a mixture of the two, i.e., a fortified hill, and by considering the presumed meaning of the root, it might signify a "bulging or rounded" fortification.&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt;

Biblical verses in which it has been translated either as "fortified place " (tower, citadel, stronghold etc.) or "hill" are {{Bibleref2|2 Kings 5:24}}, 2 Chronicles 27:3 and 33:14, {{Bibleref2|Isaiah 32:14}}, Nehemiah 3:26 and 11:21, and {{Bibleref2|Micah 4:8}}.&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; On the Mesha Stele, named for the king of Moab who erected it, Mesha says: "I built Q-R-CH-H (? Karhah), the wall of ''ye'arim'' [forests], and the wall of ''ophel'' and I built its gates and I built its towers."&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; Here ''ophel'' is commonly translated as "citadel".&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mesha Stele: Traduction du texte |translator=[[André Lemaire]], 1986 |work=Louvre, official website |publisher=Musée du Louvre, Paris |language=French |url= http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mesha-stele |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jerusalem Ophel==
===Hebrew Bible===
The location of the Ophel of the Hebrew Bible is easy to make out from the references from {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 27:3; 33:14}} and {{Bibleref2|Nehemiah 3:26, 27}}: it was on the eastern ridge and south of the [[First Temple|Temple]], and probably near the middle of the southeastern hill (i.e., the eastern ridge segment starting below the saddle south of the Herodian Temple Mount, and stretching down to the [[King's Garden (Jerusalem)|King's Garden]]).&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt; Therefore, the use of the term "Ophel ridge" for the entire southeastern hill including the saddle area seems to be wrong.&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt;

Two kings of Judah, [[Jotham]] and [[Manasseh]], are described to have massively strengthened the fortifications at "Ophel" (2 Chronicles 27:3 and 33:14), leading to the conclusion that this must have been an area of great strategic importance, and either very close to or identical with the "stronghold of Zion" conquered and reused by King David ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 5:7}}).&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt;

===Josephus' "Ophlas"===
[[Josephus]], writing about the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–70 CE), uses the Graecised form "Ophlas", and places it slightly higher up the eastern ridge from the [[First Temple]]-period Ophel, touching the "eastern cloister of the temple" ([[The Jewish War|Jewish Wars]], V, iv, 2 &lt;ref&gt;The Wars Of The Jews, Book V, Chapter IV, paragraph 2. At sacred-texts.com  [http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/war-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the context of "the temple and the parts thereto adjoining, .... and the .... '[[Kidron Valley|Valley of the Cedron]]'" ([[The Jewish War|Jewish Wars]], V, iv, 1 &lt;ref&gt;The Wars Of The Jews, Book V, Chapter IV, paragraph 1. At sacred-texts.com  [http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/war-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="ISBE"/&gt;

&lt;!-- {{Context|date=May 2012}} --&gt;
[[Image:Theb1982.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a man taking measurements with a theodolite in a frozen environment.|[[Gustav Elfving]] developed the optimal design of experiments, and so minimized surveyors' need for  [[theodolite|theodolite measurements]] ''(pictured)'', while trapped in his tent in storm-ridden [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="Nord76"&gt;{{harvtxt|Nordström|1999|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the [[design of experiments]], '''optimal designs''' (or '''optimum designs'''&lt;ref&gt;The adjective "optimum" (and not "optimal") "is the slightly older form in English and avoids the construction 'optim(um) + al´—there is no 'optimalis' in Latin" (page x in ''Optimum Experimental Designs, with SAS'', by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias).&lt;/ref&gt;) are a class of [[design of experiments|experimental designs]] that are [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] with respect to some [[statistical theory|statistical]] [[objective function|criterion]]. The creation of this field of statistics has been credited to Danish statistician [[Kirstine Smith]].&lt;ref name=GL2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guttorp |first=P. |last2=Lindgren |first2=G. |title= Karl Pearson and the Scandinavian school of statistics |journal= International Statistical Review |volume=77 |year=2009 |page=64 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-5823.2009.00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KS1918&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Kirstine |title=On the standard deviations of adjusted and interpolated values of an observed polynomial function and its constants and the guidance they give towards a proper choice of the distribution of observations |journal=Biometrika |volume=12 |year=1918 |page=1 |doi=10.2307/2331929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[design of experiments]] for [[estimation theory|estimating]] [[statistical model]]s, '''optimal designs''' allow parameters to be [[bias of an estimator|estimated without bias]] and with [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|minimum variance]]. A non-optimal design requires a greater number of [[replication (statistics)|experimental runs]] to [[estimation theory|estimate]] the [[parametric model|parameters]] with the same [[efficiency (statistics)|precision]] as an optimal design. In practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce the costs of experimentation.

The optimality of a design depends on the [[statistical model]] and is assessed with respect to a statistical criterion, which is related to the variance-matrix of the estimator. Specifying an appropriate model and specifying a suitable criterion function both require understanding of [[statistical theory]] and practical knowledge with [[design of experiments|designing experiments]].

==Advantages==

Optimal designs offer three advantages over suboptimal [[Design of experiments|experimental designs]]:&lt;ref&gt;These three advantages (of optimal designs) are documented in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Optimal designs reduce the costs of experimentation by allowing [[statistical model]]s to be estimated with fewer experimental runs.
#Optimal designs can accommodate multiple types of factors, such as process, mixture, and discrete factors.
#Designs can be optimized when the design-space is constrained, for example, when the mathematical process-space contains factor-settings that are practically infeasible (e.g. due to safety concerns).

==Minimizing the variance of estimators==
Experimental designs are evaluated using statistical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Such criteria are called [[objective function]]s in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that the [[least squares]] estimator minimizes the [[variance]] of [[Expected value|mean]]-[[Bias of an estimator|unbiased]] [[estimators]] (under the conditions of the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]). In the [[estimation]] theory for [[statistical model]]s with one [[real number|real]] [[parameter]], the [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the variance of an ([[statistical efficiency|"efficient"]]) estimator is called the "[[Fisher information]]" for that estimator.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Fisher information]] and other "[[entropy (information theory)|information]]" [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s are fundamental concepts in [[statistical theory]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this reciprocity, '''''minimizing'' the ''variance''''' corresponds to '''''maximizing'' the ''information'''''.

When the [[statistical model]] has several [[parameter]]s, however, the [[Expected value|mean]] of the parameter-estimator is a [[Coordinate vector|vector]] and its [[covariance matrix|variance]] is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The [[inverse matrix]] of the variance-matrix is called the "information matrix". Because the variance of the estimator of a parameter vector is a matrix, the problem of "minimizing the variance" is complicated. Using [[statistical theory]], statisticians compress the  information-matrix using real-valued [[summary statistics]]; being real-valued functions, these "information criteria" can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, statisticians have evaluated estimators and designs by considering some [[summary statistics|summary statistic]] of the covariance matrix (of a [[Expected value|mean]]-[[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimator]]), usually with positive real values (like the [[determinant]] or [[matrix trace]]). Working with positive real-numbers brings several advantages: If the estimator of a single parameter has a positive variance, then the variance and the Fisher information are both positive real numbers; hence they are members of the convex cone of nonnegative real numbers (whose nonzero members have reciprocals in this same cone). &lt;br /&gt;
For several parameters, the covariance-matrices and information-matrices are elements of the convex cone of nonnegative-definite symmetric matrices in a [[partial order|partially]] [[ordered vector space]], under the [[Charles Loewner|Loewner]] (Löwner) order. This cone is closed under matrix-matrix addition, under matrix-inversion, and under the multiplication of positive real-numbers and matrices.

An exposition of matrix theory and the Loewner-order appears in Pukelsheim.
&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional optimality-criteria are [[Invariant theory|invariants]] of the [[Fisher information|information]] matrix; algebraically, the traditional optimality-criteria are [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the information matrix.

*'''A'''-optimality ("'''average'''" or '''trace''')
**One criterion is '''A-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the [[invertible matrix|inverse]] of the information matrix. This criterion results in minimizing the average variance of the estimates of the regression coefficients.
*'''C'''-optimality
**This criterion minimizes the variance of a [[best linear unbiased estimator]] of a predetermined linear combination of model parameters.
*'''D'''-optimality ('''determinant''')
**A popular criterion is '''D-optimality''', which seeks to minimize |(X'X)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;|, or equivalently maximize the [[determinant]] of the [[information matrix]] X'X of the design. This criterion results in maximizing the [[Differential entropy|differential Shannon information]] content of the parameter estimates.
*'''E'''-optimality ('''eigenvalue''')
**Another design is '''E-optimality''', which maximizes the minimum [[eigenvalue]] of the information matrix.
*'''T'''-optimality
**This criterion maximizes the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the information matrix.

Other optimality-criteria are concerned with the variance of [[Predictive inference|predictions]]:
*'''G'''-optimality
**A popular criterion is '''G-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the maximum entry in the [[diagonal#Matrices|diagonal]] of the [[hat matrix]] X(X'X)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;X'. This has the effect of minimizing the maximum variance of the predicted values.
*'''I'''-optimality ('''integrated''')
**A second criterion on prediction variance is '''I-optimality''', which seeks to minimize  the average prediction variance ''over the design space''.
*'''V'''-optimality ('''variance''')
**A third criterion on prediction variance is '''V-optimality''', which seeks to minimize the average prediction variance over a set of m specific points.&lt;ref&gt;The above optimality-criteria are convex functions on domains of [[Semidefinite programming|symmetric positive-semidefinite matrices]]: See an on-line textbook for practitioners, which has many illustrations and statistical applications:
* {{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}  (book in pdf)
Boyd and Vandenberghe discuss optimal experimental designs on pages 384–396.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrasts===
{{Main|Contrast (statistics)}} {{See also|Nuisance parameter}}
In many applications, the statistician is most concerned with a [[Nuisance parameter|"parameter of interest"]] rather than with [[Nuisance parameter|"nuisance parameters"]]. More generally, statisticians consider [[linear combination]]s of parameters, which are estimated via linear combinations of treatment-means in the [[design of experiments]] and in the [[analysis of variance]]; such linear combinations are called [[contrast (statistics)|contrasts]]. Statisticians can use appropriate optimality-criteria for such [[Nuisance parameter|parameters of interest]] and for more generally for [[Contrast (statistics)|contrasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Optimality criteria for [[nuisance parameter|"parameters of interest"]] and for [[Contrast (statistics)|contrasts]] are discussed by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Catalogs of optimal designs occur in books and in software libraries.

In addition, major [[List of statistical packages|statistical systems]] like [[SAS System|SAS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] have procedures for optimizing a design according to a user's specification. The experimenter must specify a [[Statistical model|model]] for the design and an optimality-criterion before the method can compute an optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;Iterative methods and approximation algorithms are surveyed in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and in the monographs of Fedorov (historical) and Pukelsheim, and in the survey article by Gaffke and Heiligers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical considerations==

Some advanced topics in optimal design require more [[statistical theory]] and practical knowledge in designing experiments.

===Model dependence and robustness===
Since the optimality criterion of most optimal designs is based on some function of the information matrix, the 'optimality' of a given design is ''[[Statistical model|model]] dependent'': While an optimal design is best for that [[Statistical model|model]], its performance may deteriorate on other [[Statistical model|models]]. On other [[Statistical model|models]], an ''optimal'' design can be either better or worse than a non-optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;See Kiefer ("Optimum Designs for Fitting Biased Multiresponse Surfaces" pages 289–299).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important to [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] the performance of designs under alternative [[Statistical model|models]].&lt;!--  and for several criteria --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such benchmarking is discussed in the textbook by Atkinson et al. and in the papers of Kiefer. ''[[Statistical model|Model]]-[[Robust statistics|robust]]'' designs (including "Bayesian" designs) are surveyed by Chang and Notz.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing an optimality criterion and robustness===
The choice of an appropriate optimality criterion requires some thought, and it is useful to benchmark the performance of designs with respect to several optimality criteria. Cornell writes that

{{quote|since the [traditional optimality] criteria . . . are variance-minimizing criteria, . . .  a design that is optimal for a given model using one of the . . . criteria is usually near-optimal for the same model with respect to the other criteria.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Cornell, John
|title=Experiments with Mixtures: Designs, Models, and the Analysis of Mixture Data
|edition=third
|publisher=Wiley
|year=2002
|isbn=0-471-07916-2
}} (Pages 400-401)
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, there are several classes of designs for which all the traditional optimality-criteria agree, according to the theory of "universal optimality" of [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]].&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to "universal optimality" appears in the textbook of Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias. More detailed expositions occur in the advanced textbook of Pukelsheim and the papers of Kiefer.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of practitioners like Cornell and the "universal optimality" theory of Kiefer suggest that robustness with respect to changes in the ''optimality-criterion'' is much greater than is robustness with respect to changes in the ''model''.

====Flexible optimality criteria and convex analysis====

High-quality statistical software provide a combination of libraries of optimal designs or iterative methods for constructing approximately optimal designs, depending on the model specified and the optimality criterion. Users may use a standard optimality-criterion or may program a custom-made criterion.

All of the traditional optimality-criteria are [[Convex function|convex (or concave) functions]], and therefore optimal-designs are amenable to the mathematical theory of [[convex analysis]] and their computation can use specialized methods of [[Convex optimization|convex minimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Computational methods are discussed by Pukelsheim and by Gaffke and Heiligers.&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner need not select ''exactly one'' traditional, optimality-criterion, but can specify a custom criterion. In particular, the practitioner can specify a convex criterion using the maxima of convex optimality-criteria and [[Conical combination|nonnegative combinations]] of optimality criteria (since these operations preserve [[convex functions]]). For ''convex'' optimality criteria, the [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] allows the practitioner to verify that a given design is globally optimal.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] is discussed in Chapter 9 of Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] is related with the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre]]-[[Fenchel's duality theorem|Fenchel]] [[Convex conjugate|conjugacy]] for [[convex function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pukelsheim uses [[convex analysis]] to study [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]]-[[Jacob Wolfowitz|Wolfowitz]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZcfDZUJ4F8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Kiefer+Wolfowitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u0F1j-W3CF&amp;sig=-bWiYksuk7RIOeZ_qZnB9Jpj0tk&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=izghSvvUCs6zsgajuo24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 equivalence theorem] in relation to the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre]]-[[Fenchel's duality theorem|Fenchel]] [[Convex conjugate|conjugacy]] for [[convex function]]s

The [[convex optimization|minimization]] of [[convex function]]s on domains of [[Semidefinite programming|symmetric positive-semidefinite matrices]] is explained in an on-line textbook for practitioners, which has many illustrations and statistical applications:
* {{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/| author9=Boyd, Stephen and Vandenberghe, Lieven}}  (book in pdf)
Boyd and Vandenberghe discuss optimal experimental designs on pages 384–396.
&lt;/ref&gt;

If an optimality-criterion lacks [[Quasiconvex function|convexity]], then finding a [[Global optimization|global optimum]] and verifying its optimality often are difficult.

===Model uncertainty and Bayesian approaches===

====Model selection====
{{See also|Model selection}}
When scientists wish to test several theories, then a statistician can design an experiment that allows optimal tests between specified models. Such "discrimination experiments" are especially important in the [[biostatistics]] supporting  [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[pharmacodynamics]], following the work of [[David R. Cox|Cox]] and Atkinson.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 20 in Atkinison, Donev, and Tobias.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bayesian experimental design====
{{Main|Bayesian experimental design}}
When practitioners need to consider multiple [[statistical model|models]], they can specify a [[Probability measure|probability-measure]] on the models and then select any design maximizing the [[expected value]] of such an experiment. Such probability-based optimal-designs are called optimal [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[Bayesian experimental design|designs]]. Such [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] are used especially for [[generalized linear models]] (where the response follows an [[Exponential family|exponential-family]] distribution).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] are discussed in Chapter 18 of the textbook by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias. More advanced discussions occur in the monograph by Fedorov and Hackl, and the articles by Chaloner and Verdinelli and by DasGupta. [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian designs]] and other aspects of "model-robust" designs are discussed by Chang and Notz.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a [[Bayesian experimental design|Bayesian design]] does not force statisticians to use [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian methods]] to analyze the data, however. Indeed, the "Bayesian" label for probability-based experimental-designs is disliked by some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;As an alternative to "''Bayesian'' optimality", "''on-average'' optimality" is advocated in Fedorov and Hackl.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative terminology for "Bayesian" optimality includes "on-average" optimality or "population" optimality.

==Iterative experimentation==
Scientific experimentation is an iterative process, and statisticians have developed several approaches to the optimal design of sequential experiments.

===Sequential analysis===
{{Main|Sequential analysis}}
[[Sequential analysis]] was pioneered by [[Abraham Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Herman Chernoff]] wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs,&lt;ref&gt;Chernoff, H. (1972) ''Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design,'' SIAM Monograph.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] were surveyed later by S. Zacks.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, S. (1996) "Adaptive Designs for Parametric Models". In: Ghosh, S. and Rao, C. R., (Eds) (1996). ''Design and Analysis of Experiments,'' Handbook of Statistics, Volume 13. North-Holland. {{isbn|0-444-82061-2}}.  (pages 151–180)&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, much work on the optimal design of experiments is related to the theory of [[optimal decision]]s, especially the [[statistical decision theory]] of [[Abraham Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/cats/People/HenryPage.htm Henry P. Wynn] wrote, "the modern theory of optimum design has its roots in the decision theory school of U.S. statistics founded by [[Abraham Wald]]" in his introduction "Jack Kiefer's Contributions to Experimental Design", which is pages xvii–xxiv in the following volume:

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response-surface methodology===
{{Main|Response surface methodology}}
Optimal designs for [[Response surface methodology|response-surface models]] are discussed in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias, and in the survey of Gaffke and Heiligers and in the mathematical text of Pukelsheim. The [[Blocking (statistics)|blocking]] of optimal designs is discussed in the textbook of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and also in the monograph by Goos.

The earliest optimal designs were developed to estimate the parameters of regression models with continuous variables, for example, by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|J. D. Gergonne]] in 1815 (Stigler).  In English, two early contributions were made by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090810040534/http://www.webdoe.cc/publications/kirstine.php Kirstine Smith].

Pioneering designs for multivariate [[Response surface methodology|response-surfaces]] were proposed by [[George E. P. Box]]. However, Box's designs have few optimality properties. Indeed, the [[Box–Behnken design]] requires excessive experimental runs when the number of variables exceeds three.&lt;ref&gt;In the field of [[response surface methodology]], the [[Statistical efficiency|inefficiency]] of the [[Box–Behnken design]] is noted by Wu and Hamada (page 422).
* {{cite book |author1=Wu, C. F. Jeff  |author2=Hamada, Michael  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Parameter Design Optimization |publisher=Wiley |year=2002 |isbn=0-471-25511-4}}
Optimal designs for "follow-up" experiments are discussed by Wu and Hamada.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Box's [[Central composite design|"central-composite" designs]] require more experimental runs than do the optimal designs of Kôno.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Statistical efficiency|inefficiency]] of [[George E. P. Box|Box]]'s [[Central composite design|"central-composite" designs]] are discussed by according to Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias (page 165). These authors also discuss the [[Blocking (statistics)|blocking]] of Kôno-type designs for quadratic [[response surface methodology|response-surfaces]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===System identification and stochastic approximation===
{{See also|System identification|Stochastic approximation}}
The optimization of sequential experimentation is studied also in [[stochastic programming]] and in [[Systems analysis|systems]] and [[Control theory|control]]. Popular methods include [[stochastic approximation]] and other methods of [[stochastic optimization]]. Much of this research has been associated with the subdiscipline of [[system identification]].&lt;ref&gt;In system identification, the following books have chapters on optimal experimental design:
* {{cite book |author1=Goodwin, Graham C.  |author2=Payne, Robert L. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dynamic [[System identification|System Identification]]: Experiment Design and Data Analysis | publisher=Academic Press | year=1977 |isbn=0-12-289750-1}}
* {{cite book |author1=Walter, Éric  |author2=Pronzato, Luc  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=[[System identification|Identification]] of Parametric Models from Experimental Data |publisher=Springer |year=1997}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In computational [[optimal control]], D. Judin &amp; A. Nemirovskii and [http://www.ipu.ru/labs/lab7/eng/staff/polyak.htm Boris Polyak] has described methods that are more efficient than the ([[Armijo rule|Armijo-style]]) [[Subgradient method#Step size rules|step-size rules]] introduced by [[George E. P. Box|G. E. P. Box]] in [[Response surface methodology|response-surface methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Some step-size rules for of Judin &amp; Nemirovskii and of [http://www.ipu.ru/labs/lab7/eng/staff/polyak.htm Polyak] are explained in the textbook by Kushner and Yin:
* {{cite book |author=[[Harold J. Kushner|Kushner, Harold J.]] and Yin, G. George|title=[[Stochastic approximation|Stochastic Approximation]] and Recursive Algorithms and Applications |edition=Second | publisher=Springer  | year=2003 |isbn=0-387-00894-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minimisation (clinical trials)|Adaptive designs]] are used in [[clinical trials]], and optimal [[Minimisation (clinical trials)|adaptive designs]] are surveyed in the ''Handbook of Experimental Designs'' chapter by Shelemyahu Zacks.

==Specifying the number of experimental runs==

===Using a computer to find a good design===

There are several methods of finding an optimal design, given an ''a priori'' restriction on the number of experimental runs or replications. Some of these methods are discussed by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and in the paper by Hardin and [[Neil Sloane|Sloane]]. Of course, fixing the number of experimental runs ''a priori'' would be impractical.  Prudent statisticians examine the other optimal designs, whose number of experimental runs differ.

===Discretizing probability-measure designs===

In the mathematical theory on optimal experiments, an optimal design can be a [[probability measure]] that is [[Support (measure theory)|supported]] on an infinite set of observation-locations. Such optimal probability-measure designs solve a mathematical problem that neglected to specify the cost of observations and experimental runs. Nonetheless, such optimal probability-measure designs can be [[Discretization|discretized]] to furnish [[Approximation|approximately]] optimal designs.&lt;ref&gt;The [[discretization]] of optimal probability-measure designs to provide [[Approximation|approximately]] optimal designs is discussed by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias and by Pukelsheim (especially Chapter 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a finite set of observation-locations suffices to [[Support (measure theory)|support]] an optimal design. Such a result was proved by Kôno and [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] in their works on [[Response surface methodology|response-surface designs]] for quadratic models. The Kôno–Kiefer analysis explains why optimal designs for response-surfaces can have discrete supports, which are very similar as do the less efficient designs that have been traditional in [[response surface methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Regarding designs for quadratic [[response surface methodology|response-surfaces]], the results of Kôno and [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] are discussed in Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias.

Mathematically, such results are associated with [[Chebyshev polynomials]], "Markov systems", and "moment spaces": See

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1815, an article on optimal designs for [[polynomial regression]] was published by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]], according to [[Stephen M. Stigler|Stigler]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] proposed an economic theory of scientific experimentation in 1876, which sought to maximize the precision of the estimates. Peirce's optimal allocation immediately improved the accuracy of gravitational experiments and was used for decades by Peirce and his colleagues. In his 1882 published lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Peirce introduced experimental design with these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Logic will not undertake to inform you what kind of experiments you ought to make in order best to determine the acceleration of gravity, or the value of the Ohm; but it will tell you how to proceed to form a plan of experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;[....] Unfortunately practice generally precedes theory, and it is the usual fate of mankind to get things done in some boggling way first, and find out afterward how they could have been done much more easily and perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1882), "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, published in ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1882, see p. 11, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Logic+will+not+undertake+to+inform%22+%22unfortunately+practice+generally%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, see 59, 63, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 4, pp. 378–82, see 378, 379, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 210–14, see 210–1, also lower down on 211.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kirstine Smith]] proposed optimal designs for polynomial models in 1918. (Kirstine Smith had been a student of the Danish statistician [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] and was working with [[Karl Pearson]] in London.)

'''''Philobiblon''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca]], Romania, in collaboration with [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj University Press]] (Presa Universitară Clujeană). It was established in 1996 as a continuation of an irregular publication entitled ''Biblioteca și Învățămîntul'' (''Library and Education'').

The subtitles and publication frequency of the journal have changed several times: ''Bulletin of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (1996−2008), ''Journal of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (2009−2010), and currently: ''Transylvanian Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Humanities''. Until 2011 it was published annually (except for 1996−1997, when it was also published twice a year).

''Philobiblon'' is available electronically through [[EBSCO Publishing]] and [[ProQuest]] databases, as well as in print. The journal was ranked in 2011 by the [[Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education]] in seven Humanities categories as a periodical having serious chances to gain international import: Arts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_10.pdf|title=Arts|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_9_20121.pdf|title=Philosophy|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_5.pdf|title=Architecture|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; History of Science;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_1.pdf|title=History of Science|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historiography and Theory of History;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_4.pdf|title=Historiography|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian Language and Literature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_7.pdf|title=Language and Literature|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Languages and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_8.pdf|title=Foreign Languages|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Until 2011, issues of the journal were thematic, engaging several areas of academic research in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. As of 2011, the journal changed its profile, appearing with two issues per year as an academic journal of multidisciplinary research in humanities, covering research at the confluence of various branches of the humanities and social sciences and promoting the contemporary synergy of sciences (such as, for example, [[medical humanities]]).

Selected articles from ''Philobiblon'' are translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in a series of biannually published [[Anthology|anthologies]] entitled ''Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria |url=http://www.philobiblon.ro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=76&amp;lang=en |title=Welcome |work=Philobiblon |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ride height''' (also called '''ground clearance''' or simply '''clearance''') is the amount of space between the base of an automobile [[tire]] and the lowest point (typically the axle); or, more properly, to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and the lowest part of a vehicle other than those parts designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for cars, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.

[[File:Ford F-250 lifted.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Super Duty#Third generation (2011–present)|Ford F-250]] with aftermarket suspension modifications to increase ride height]]
Ground clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, especially cars, variations in clearance represent a trade-off between [[Automobile handling|handling]] and practicality. A higher ground clearance means that the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of [[rollover]] is higher). However, it also means that the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the road scraping against and likely damaging the chassis and underbody. Higher ride heights will typically adversely affect [[aerodynamic]] properties. This is why [[sports car]]s typically have very low clearances, while [[off-road vehicle]]s and [[SUV]]s have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Hummer]].

For [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance: a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the [[chassis]] is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The final design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFVs have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle.

[[File:Lowered BMW M3.jpg|thumb|BMW E46 "stanced" using aftermarket suspension kit]]
Lowering a car's [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many people prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body{{According to whom|date=October 2017}}, and there is an easily realized [[car handling]] improvement from the lower center of gravity. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering won't increase the probability of damage significantly. On most automobiles, ride height is modified by changing the length of the suspension [[Spring (device)|springs]], and is the essence of many aftermarket suspension kits supplied by manufacturers such as [[Eibach Federn|Eibach]] and [[H&amp;R (automotive manufacturer)|H&amp;R]].

Some cars have used [[underslung frame]]s to achieve a lower ride height and the consequent improvement in center of gravity. The brass-era cars of the [[American Motor Car Company]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/113_0606_25_dodge_roadster/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-leveling suspension]] systems are designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. Vehicles not equipped with self-leveling will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties.

Some modern automobiles (such as Audi's [[Audi Allroad Quattro|Allroad Quattro]]) have [[height adjustable suspension|adjustable suspension systems]], which can vary the ride height by locating the suspension mounting points, depending on road conditions and/or the settings selected by the driver.

Other, simpler suspension systems, such as [[coilover]] springs, offer a way of manually adjusting ride height (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring [[in situ]], using a threaded shaft and adjustable knob or nut.

[[Image:MUTCD W10-5.svg|100px|thumb|right|[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] warning sign for a [[Level  crossing|low-ground-clearance crossing]]]] 18-wheel [[tractor-trailers]] also have to take the ground clearance of both their tractor and especially trailer into consideration on certain areas of uneven terrain, such as raised [[Level crossing|railroad crossings]]. Their extremely long [[wheelbase]] means that such terrain could potentially catch the undercarriage of the trailer in the wide space between the axles, potentially leaving the truck stuck with no means to extricate itself.

In some areas buses are required to have a ground clearance of at least {{convert|100|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090522222432/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/pdfs/freight/code_conduct_buses.pdf "Code of Practice for Buses", section 3.2: Ground Clearance]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Too much ride height can cause the vehicle to have a higher center of gravity, which could cause the vehicle to be unstable, or even flip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">'''SEETEP''' stands for  Solar Energy and Environmental Education Program. It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the [[Nyanza Province]]  of Kenya. Its purpose is to build  a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"About Seetep", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=4, Retrieved  2012-03-08,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

Since 1992 [[Arc Aid and Arc Kenya|ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya]] have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;"ARO Development Centre", http://www.arc-aid.no/aro-development-centre/, Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011530/http://www.elkem.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=241 Elkem Solar]. Elkem installed solar panels in  ARO Development Centre which is  very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously  carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.

ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with [http://www.kvadraturen.vgs.no/ Kvadraturen School](also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in [https://www.google.no/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kisumu+polytechnic Kisumu Polytechnic] a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

[[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] is funding the project as part of their development activities. [http://www.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=8&amp;amid=59171 Vest-Agder County Municipality] has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.

==Progress==

In 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;"Seetep Progress", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=7,Retrieved 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work.

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014."

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-jobs-2017-update|title=STEM Jobs: 2017 Update {{!}} Economics &amp; Statistics Administration|website=www.esa.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.  The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2188-building-americas-future-stem-education/for-students/blog/news.php|title=Building America’s Future: STEM Education Intervention is a Win-Win|website=Penn Wharton Public Policy Initative|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Updates ====
PEW findings revealed that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students’ concentration in learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/01/12/americans-rate-u.s.-stem-education-as-mediocre.aspx|title=Americans Rate U.S. K–12 STEM Education as Mediocre -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Hong Kong ===
STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document entitled ''Promotion of STEM Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Brief%20on%20STEM%20(Overview)_eng_20151105.pdf|format=PDF|title=Promotion of STEM Education |website=Edb.gov.hk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes the strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education.

===Turkey===
Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FeTeMM Çalışma Grubu|url=http://fetemm.org/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Education Task Force|url=http://tstem.com/|website=Tstem.com |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;"Woman teaching geometry"&lt;/center&gt; Illustration at the beginning of a [[medieval]] translation of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' ({{circa|1310 AD}})]]

{{see also|Women in science|Women in engineering|Women in computing|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

[[File:-BLMcareers (21678771368) crop.jpg|thumb|alt= A woman holding a notebook crouches next to a theodolite on a tripod. The instrument is set up on a bank in a forest.|A surveyor using a [[total station]]]]
'''Surveying''' or '''land surveying''' is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a '''land surveyor'''. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for [[ownership]], locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.

Surveyors work with elements of [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[regression analysis]], [[physics]], engineering, [[metrology]], [[programming language]]s, and the law. They use equipment, such as [[total station]]s, robotic total stations, [[theodolites]], GPS receivers, [[retroreflector]]s, [[3D scanner]]s, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, [[Geographic information system|GIS]], and surveying software.

Surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. The planning and execution of most forms of construction require it. It is also used in transport, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.

==Definition==
The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] defines the function of surveying as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition |url=http://www.fig.net/about/general/definition/index.asp |website=''fig.net'' |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;
* to determine, measure and represent land, three-dimensional objects, point-fields and trajectories;
* to assemble and interpret land and geographically related information,
* to use that information for the planning and efficient administration of the land, the sea and any structures thereon; and,
* to conduct research into the above practices and to develop them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Ancient surveying===
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig23--plumb rule.png|upright=0.4|thumb|alt=refer to caption |A plumb rule from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In [[ancient Egypt]], a [[rope stretcher]] would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the [[Nile River]]. The almost perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. The ''[[Groma surveying|Groma]]'' instrument originated in [[Mesopotamia]] (early 1st millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM 2008|author=Hong-Sen Yan &amp; Marco Ceccarelli|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4020-9484-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistoric monument at [[Stonehenge]] (c. 2500 BC) was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''.

The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] described ways of measuring distant objects in his work ''[[Haidao Suanjing]]'' or ''The Sea Island Mathematical Manual'', published in 263 AD.

The Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD).&lt;ref name="Lewis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=M. J. T.|title=Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Izau5_ihmsC|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=23 April 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman surveyors were known as ''[[Gromatici]]''.

In medieval Europe, [[beating the bounds]] maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.

In England, [[William the Conqueror]] commissioned the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area's content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Printed image of surveying equipment. | Table of Surveying, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Abel Foullon described a [[plane table]] in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.

[[Gunter's chain]] was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]]. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.

[[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]] described a [[Theodolite]] that measured horizontal angles in his book ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571). Joshua Habermel ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. [[Jesse Ramsden]] introduced the first precision [[theodolite]] in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring [[angle]]s in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]] using an accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] invented an instrument that used a [[telescope]] with an installed [[crosshair]] as a target device, in 1640. [[James Watt]] developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the [[parallactic angle]] from which the distance to a point could be deduced.

Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of [[Triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116,1 kilometres). He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[resection (orientation)|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, [[Jacques Cassini]] and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César]] undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time, triangulation methods were by then well established for local map-making.

[[File:1870 Index Chart to GTS India-1.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of triangulation network covering India.| A map of India showing the Great Trigonometrical Survey, produced in 1870]]

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General [[William Roy]]'s [[Ordnance Survey]] of Great Britain began the [[Principal Triangulation of Britain]]. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out [[canal]]s, roads and rail.

In the US, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] created the [[Public Land Survey System]]. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.

[[Napoleon]] Bonaparte founded [[continental Europe]]'s first [[cadastre]] in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.
[[File:Camp of surverying party at Russel's Tank, Arizona, on eastern slope of Laja Range, 1,271 miles from Missouri River. (Boston Public Library) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A railroad surveying party at Russel's Tank, [[Arizona]] in the 1860s]]
[[Robert Torrens]] introduced the [[Torrens system]] in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.
Surveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.

===20th century===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S12054, Vermessungstruppe bei Fernaufnahmen.jpg|thumb|alt=Soldier standing next to a Telescopic instrument on a tripod. |A German engineer surveying during the [[First World War]], 1918]]

At the beginning of the century surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. [[Trevor Wadley|Dr Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] developed the [[Tellurometer]] during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sturman|first1=Brian|last2=Wright|first2=Alan|title=The History of the Tellurometer|url=http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf|publisher=International Federation of Surveyors|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced [[electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves |first1=Marc |title=Geodimeter-The First Name in EDM |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225310/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |archivedate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahun|first1=Jerry|title=Electronic Distance Measurement|url=http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|website=''Jerrymahun.com''|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729013241/http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|archivedate=29 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments saved the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.

Advances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as [[total station]]s. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders, and on-board calculation programs.

The first satellite positioning system was the [[US Navy]] [[Transit (satellite)|TRANSIT system]]. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system's main purpose was to provide position information to [[Polaris missile]] submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious, and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.

The US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission to provide more accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Recent improvements to both satellites and receivers allow [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys get high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.

===21st century===
The [[theodolite]], [[total station]], and [[Real Time Kinematic|RTK]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] survey remain the primary methods in use.

Remote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and use of [[lidar]] for topographical surveys. [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] technology along with [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] image processing is also appearing.

The main surveying instruments in use around the world are the [[theodolite]], [[Tape measure|measuring tape]], [[total station]], [[3D scanner]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/[[GNSS]], [[dumpy level|level]] and [[Philadelphia rod|rod]]. Most instruments screw onto a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]] when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.

The theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate ''circles'', ''protractors'' or ''alidades'' to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.

The [[gyrotheodolite]] is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.

The [[total station]] is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

Modern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to [[satellite positioning system]]s, such as [[Global Positioning System]]. [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS systems have increased the speed of surveying, but they are still only horizontally accurate to about 20&amp;nbsp;mm and vertically to 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fbiZz-37XIYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=RTK+GPS+accuracy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pZ3H0k-hm1&amp;sig=Ml6Pyrt-tQzIaByRhOnzE_h_gcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result National Cooperative Highway Research Program: ''Collecting, Processing and Integrating GPS data into GIS'', p. 40.

GPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] that can be over 20&amp;nbsp;km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.

Surveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys makes them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place [[beacons]] on the ground (about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} apart). This method reaches precisions between 5–40&amp;nbsp;cm (depending on flight height).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf Toni Schenk, Suyoung Seo, Beata Csatho: ''Accuracy Study of Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Photogrammetry'', p. 118] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325194334/http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]]; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.

===Software===
Land surveyors, construction professionals and civil engineers using [[total station]], [[GPS]], [[3D scanner]]s and other collector data use Land Surveying Software to increase efficiency, accuracy and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/4843/|title=View DigitalGlobe Imagery Solutions @ Geospatial Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveying techniques==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|alt= A compass with extra sights for measuring bearings. |A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], still used commonly today by geographers, geologists and surveyors for field-based measurements]]

Surveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.
GPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.

===Distance measurement===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A Woman with a backpack holding a laser rangefinder, a handheld GPS and a Tablet computer. |Example of modern equipment for surveying ([[Field-Map]] technology): [[GPS]], [[laser rangefinder]] and field computer allows surveying as well as [[cartography]] (creation of map in real-time) and field data collection.]]
Before EDM devices, [[distance]]s were measured using a variety of means. These included chains with links of a known length such as a [[Gunter's chain]], or measuring tapes made of steel or [[invar]]. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to "break" (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. [[Surveyor's wheel|Perambulators]], or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. [[Tacheometry]] is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.

===Angle measurement===
Historically, horizontal angles were measured by using a [[compass]] to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with [[reticle]]s atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see [[theodolite]]). Levels and calibrated circles allowed measurement of vertical angles. [[Vernier scale|Vernier]]s allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century [[Transit (surveying)|transit]].

The plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 [[Francis Ronalds]] invented a [[Reflecting instrument#Surveying sector|reflecting instrument]] for recording angles graphically by modifying the [[Octant (instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180° difference. This is called a ''close''. If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the ''angular misclose''. The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.

===Levelling===
{{main article|Levelling}}
[[File:Tide station leveling.jpg|thumbnail|alt= A woman setting up an optical level on a tripod. |Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services staff member conducts tide station leveling in support of the US Army Corp of Engineers in Richmond, Maine.]]

The simplest method for measuring height is with an [[altimeter]]&amp;nbsp;using air pressure to find height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. ''Turning'' is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

===Determining position===
The primary way of determining one's position on the earth's surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the sun, moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument's position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on the earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the earth.

===Reference networks===
{{main article|Geodetic network}}
[[File:Traversing and Offsetting DP 79152.png|thumb|alt= A diagram of survey markers running along a shoreline. |A survey using traverse and offset measurements to record the location of the shoreline shown in blue. Black dashed lines are traverse measurements between reference points (black circles). The red lines are offsets measured at right angles to the traverse lines.]]

Few survey positions are derived from first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previous measured points. This forms a reference or ''control'' network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.

Survey points are usually marked on the earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to [[Trig beacon|large beacons]] that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments on this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.

''[[Triangulation]]'' is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for [[topographic]] maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements repeated for increased accuracy. See also [[Triangulation in three dimensions]].

''Offsetting'' is an alternate method of determining position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.

[[Traverse (surveying)|''Traversing'']] is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old reference mark or known position and places a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.

====Datum and coordinate systems====
Many surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the earth, but instead measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey's objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a 'datum' (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the earth's curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.

For larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the earth.

===Errors and accuracy===

A basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|last2=Faig|first2=Wolfgang|title=Surveying|date=1988|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-008303-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AFNBqbiLzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=surveying&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_jHnU6G6J87zoASz84CwBg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=surveying&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classes of survey errors:
*''Gross errors or blunders:'' Errors made by the surveyor during the survey. Upsetting the instrument, misaiming a target, or writing down a wrong measurement are all gross errors. A large gross error may reduce the accuracy to an unacceptable level. Therefore, surveyors use redundant measurements and independent checks to detect these errors early in the survey.
*''Systematic:'' Errors that follow a consistent pattern. Examples include effects of temperature on a chain or EDM measurement, or a poorly adjusted spirit-level causing a tilted instrument or target pole. Systematic errors that have known effects can be compensated or corrected.
*''Random:'' Random errors are small unavoidable fluctuations. They are caused by imperfections in measuring equipment, eyesight, and conditions. They can be minimized by redundancy of measurement and avoiding unstable conditions. Random errors tend to cancel each other out, but checks must be made to ensure they are not propagating from one measurement to the next.

Surveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used. Errors can be detected by comparing the results of the two measurements.

Once the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in his or her work, it is [[adjustment of observations|adjusted]]. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]] method, also known as the compass rule, and the [[least squares|principle of least squares]] method.

The surveyor must be able to distinguish between [[accuracy and precision]]. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25&amp;nbsp;ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.

==Types of surveys==
{{see also|Survey (disambiguation)|Survey (disambiguation)#Earth sciences}}

Local organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:
* ''As-built survey'': a survey that documents the location of recently constructed elements of a construction project. As-built surveys are done for record, completion evaluation and payment purposes. An as-built survey is also known as a 'works as executed survey'. As built surveys are often presented in red or redline and laid over existing plans for comparison with design information.
* ''[[Cadastral surveying|Cadastral or boundary surveying]]'': a survey that establishes or re-establishes boundaries of a parcel using a [[Land description|legal description]]. It involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the lines of the parcel. These take the form of iron [[rod (shaft)|rods]], [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], or concrete monuments in the ground, or [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] set in concrete or asphalt. The ''ALTA/ACSM'' Land Title Survey is a standard proposed by the [[American Land Title Association]] and the [[American Congress on Surveying and Mapping]]. It incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey.
* ''Control surveying'': Control surveys establish reference points to use as starting positions for future surveys. Most other forms of surveying will contain elements of control surveying.
* ''[[Construction surveying]]
* ''[[Deformation Monitoring|Deformation survey]]:'' a survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. First the positions of points on an object are found. A period of time is allowed to pass and the positions are then re-measured and calculated. Then a comparison between the two sets of positions is made.
* ''[[Dimensional control survey]]:'' This is a type of survey conducted in or on a non-level surface. Common in the oil and gas industry to replace old or damaged pipes on a like-for-like basis, the advantage of dimensional control survey is that the instrument used to conduct the survey does not need to be level. This is useful in the off-shore industry, as not all platforms are fixed and are thus subject to movement.
* ''Engineering surveying'': topographic, layout, and as-built surveys associated with engineering design. They often need geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice.
* ''Foundation survey'': a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foundation was constructed in the location, and at the elevation, authorized in the ''plot plan'', ''site plan'', or ''subdivision plan''.
* ''[[Hydrographic survey]]'': a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the shoreline and bed of a body of water. Used for navigation, engineering, or resource management purposes.
* ''[[Leveling]]'': either finds the elevation of a given point or establish a point at a given elevation.
* ''[[National Flood Insurance Program#Removal from NFIP|LOMA survey]]'': Survey to change base flood line, removing property from a [[Special Flood Hazard Area|SFHA]] special flood hazard area.
* ''Measured survey'' : a building survey to produce plans of the building. such a survey may be conducted before renovation works, for commercial purpose, or at end of the construction process.
* ''[[Mine survey|Mining surveying]]'': Mining surveying includes directing the digging of mine shafts and galleries and the calculation of volume of rock. It uses specialised techniques due to the restraints to survey geometry such as vertical shafts and narrow passages.
* ''Mortgage survey:''  A ''mortgage survey'' or ''physical survey'' is a simple survey that delineates land boundaries and building locations. It checks for ''[[Structural encroachment|encroachment]]'', building setback restrictions and shows nearby flood zones. In many places a mortgage survey is a precondition for a mortgage loan.
* ''[[Photogrammetry|Photographic control survey]]'': A survey that creates reference marks visible from the air to allow [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] to be [[Orthophoto|rectified]].
* ''Stakeout, layout or setout'': an element of many other surveys where the calculated or proposed position of an object is marked on the ground. This can be temporary or permanent. This is an important component of engineering and cadastral surveying.
* ''Structural survey'': a detailed inspection to report upon the physical condition and structural stability of a building or structure. It highlights any work needed to maintain it in good repair.
* ''Subdivision'': A boundary survey that splits a property into two or more smaller properties.
* ''Topographic survey'': a survey that measures the elevation of points on a particular piece of land, and presents them as [[contour line]]s on a plot.

===Plane and geodetic surveying===
Based on the considerations and true shape of the earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.

''Plane surveying'' assumes the earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the earth's shape are too small to matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''geodetic surveying'' the curvature of the earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIvvAwAAQBAJ | title=Surveying and Levelling | accessdate=28 July 2016 | author=N N Basak | pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.

Surveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[retaining wall]]s, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for ''[[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s'' (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.

Surveyors must have a thorough knowledge of [[algebra]], basic [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]]. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, [[real property]], and contracts.

Most jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:

* ''Survey assistants'' or ''chainmen'' are usually unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old reference marks, and mark points on the ground. The term 'chainman' derives from past use of [[measuring chain]]s. An assistant would move the far end of the chain under the surveyor's direction.

* ''Survey technicians''  often operate survey instruments, run surveys in the field, do survey calculations, or draft plans. A technician usually has no legal authority and cannot certify his work. Not all technicians are qualified, but qualifications at the certificate or diploma level are available.

* ''Licensed, registered, or chartered surveyors'' usually hold a degree or higher qualification. They are often required to pass further exams to join a professional association or to gain certifying status. Surveyors are responsible for planning and management of surveys. They have to ensure that their surveys, or surveys performed under their supervision, meet the legal standards. Many [[Principal (commercial law)|principals of surveying firms]] hold this status.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a [[post nominal letters|post nominal]], which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.

A licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.

In many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on [[survey monument]]s when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.

===Surveying institutions===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|alt= Uniformed group poses with theodolites, level staves and octant. |Surveying students with their professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century]]

Most countries' governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of [[geodetic network]]s. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.

Most jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the [[International Federation of Surveyors]] (Abbreviated FIG, for {{lang-fr|link=no|Fédération Internationale des Géomètres}}). They represent the survey industry worldwide.

===Building surveying===
{{Main article|Building surveying#Profession}}

Most English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. Building surveyors focus on investigating the condition of buildings as well as legal compliance work.

===Cadastral surveying===
{{main article|Cadastral surveying}}One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.

'''Cadastral land surveyors''' are licensed by governments.
The cadastral survey branch of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt; They consult with [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], [[US Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], [[US Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[US Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], and others. The BLM used to be known as the [[General Land Office]] (GLO).

In states organized per the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.

Cadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., &amp; Hermansen, K. (1995). Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds. Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noteworthy surveyors ===
Three of the four U.S. Presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] were land surveyors. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] [[Surveying in early America|surveyed]] colonial or frontier territories prior to serving office.

[[David T. Abercrombie]] practiced land surveying before starting an [[outfitter]] store of [[excursion]] goods. The business would later turn into [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] lifestyle clothing store.

[[Percy Fawcett|Percy Harrison Fawcett]] is a British surveyor that explored the jungles of South America attempting to find the [[Lost City of Z]]. His biography and expeditions were recounted in the book [[The Lost City of Z (book)|''The Lost City of Z'']] and were later adapted on [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film screen]].

[[Inō Tadataka]] produced the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques starting in 1800, at the age of 55.

'''Survival sex''' is [[prostitution]] engaged in by a person because of their extreme need. It describes the practice of people who are [[Homelessness|homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged in society, trading sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

Some thinkers suggest that people are motivated to prostitute themselves because it is familiar&amp;nbsp;– specifically to victims of [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Mallon/&gt; Other researchers state that, while some see it as a normal job, the vast majority want to get out of the industry given the potential for disease and dangerous clients.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ/&gt;

==Prevalence==
Survival sex is common throughout the world, and has been extensively studied in many countries including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Research on AIDS: knowledge, attitudes and practices among street youth | last=Barker | first=G. | journal=Children Worldwide:  International Catholic Child Bureau | year=1993 | volume=20 | issue=2–3 | pages=41–42 | pmid=12179310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers estimate that of [[homeless youth]] in [[North America]], one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in [[Los Angeles]], about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R. Barri|title=Street kids: the lives of runaway and thrownaway teens|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4137-2|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likelihood increases with the number of days the youth has been homeless, experience of being victimized, engaging in criminal behaviour, using illegal substances, attempting [[suicide]], being [[pregnant]] and having an [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neinstein|first=Lawrence S., and Catherine Gordon, Debra Katzman and David Rosen|title=Adolescent Health Care: A Practical Guide|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9256-1|pages=974|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=0781792568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=J.M., S.T. Ennett, and C.L. Ringwalt|title=Prevalence and correlates of survival sex among runaway and homeless youth|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=89|issue=9|year=1999|pages=1406–1409|doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1406|pmc=1508758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT|Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] street children are three times likelier to engage in survival sex compared with their heterosexual counterparts, according to one study. Another found that [[transgender]] youth are most likely of all to engage in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"/&gt;

Survival sex is common in [[refugee camp]]s. In [[internally displaced persons]] camps in northern [[Uganda]], where 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflict between Ugandan government forces and the militant [[Lord's Resistance Army]], [[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Human Rights Watch|title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda|year=2005|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|pages=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDXEynHopkgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=survival+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=survival%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Some researchers say that [[street children]] do not always see survival sex as exploitative: rather, they sometimes characterize it as the "beginning of a potential relationship." Given that one of the strongest predictors of engagement in survival sex is a prior history of [[sexual abuse]] by adult caregivers, some researchers theorize that rather than being driven to survival sex out of desperation, street children might be reproducing familiar behaviour and relationship patterns.&lt;ref name=Mallon&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallon|first=Gerald P., Peg McCartt Hess|title=Child Welfare for the Twenty-first Century: A Handbook of Practices, Policies, and Programs|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-13072-1|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers maintain that people only engage in survival sex when they have no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist [[Melissa Farley]], writing in the [[New York Times]], says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. She says this is the biggest issue, not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs of themselves and their loved ones. Farley argues that even having the "job option" is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be [[traumatizing]], and she describes it as "Becoming objects for [[masturbation]]". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html Prostitution Research and Education: Intelligence Squared Debate on "It's wrong to pay for sex"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001155723/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farley, research suggests that very few prostitutes (she estimates that only 5% of women) make the choice freely. She says that most women in prostitution, including those working for [[escort service]]s, have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused as children]]. Farley claims that a majority of prostitutes would like to leave the industry.&lt;ref name=FarleyNYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/opinion/12farley.html?em&amp;ex=1205467200&amp;en=1fedfb27c3116307&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=The myth of the victimless crime |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Herbert echoed a similar opinion, also in the New York Times. Herbert says "Those who think that most of the women in prostitution want to be there are deluded... the world of the prostitute is typically filled with pimps, sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts, violent criminals and disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/opinion/27herbert.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1310946059-1B1xmETcRvMXHJWoGBy82w |title=Today's hidden slave trade |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and law enforcement==
{{globalize|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Homeless children in US 2006-10.png|thumb|Homeless children in the US grew from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bassuk, E.L., ''et al.'' (2011) [http://www.homelesschildrenamerica.org/media/NCFH_AmericaOutcast2010_web.pdf ''America’s Youngest Outcasts: 2010''] (Needham, MA: The National Center on Family Homelessness) page 20&lt;/ref&gt;]]

US municipalities such as [[Boston]] and [[Dallas]] have noticed a sharp increase in [[Runaway (dependent)|runaways]] engaging in survival sex since 1999. Dallas established a special group home for counseling, from which 75% of the underage girls who receive treatment do not return to prostitution. Congress nearly approved a program for cities to create pilot programs modeled on the Dallas system in 2007, but never appropriated the necessary funds. The Department of Justice has yet to study the number of children involved in prostitution even though they were authorized by Congress to do so in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Urbina, I. (October 26, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27runaways.html?pagewanted=all "Running in the Shadows: For Runaways, Sex Buys Survival"] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Center for Problem Oriented Policing claims, "there is no consensus on whether the practice is widespread," and recommends that runaways should be questioned about sexual abuse but not consensual sex, survival sex, or prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Dedel, K. (2006) ''[http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/ Juvenile Runaways]'' Guide No. 37 (Madison, Wisconsin: Center for Problem Oriented Policing) pp. 1 and [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/3 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]], outreach services to help sexually exploited youth should focus on the locations where they congregate and are approached by [[pimp]]s for exploitation, including public spaces such as malls and schools, and the internet. Outreach workers need to develop a close professional relationship with law enforcement to learn about trends and locations, but should carefully avoid compromising their independence or the confidentiality of their clients. Local law enforcement should target pimps and customers (janes or johns) and not the victims (youth and young adult prostitutes) for prosecution to be effective. Partnerships between nonprofit programs and law enforcement can help offer survival sex worker victims community-based services and housing when they are picked up by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (2009) ''[http://www.endhomelessness.org/files/2559_file_Sexual_Exploitation_of_Homeless_Youth_10_2009.pdf Homeless Youth and Sexual Exploitation: Research Findings and Practice Implications]'' (Washington, DC: endhomelessness.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], when sex industry women and children victims are held in police custody or remand homes, denied freedom and access to information, or abused by police, they are encouraged to lie about their situation and try to escape, so community assistance services are substantially less useful. Similar failures occur when court procedures do not allow victim testimony or representation or, when they do, are neither victim-friendly nor children-friendly; or when decisions on children's futures seldom include the opinions of children, or when the right to privacy is violated by media reporting, or by stigmatization of and discrimination against children exploited in prostitution. Governments have the duty to provide services to children, but sharing that duty with nonprofits by coordination, monitoring, and support, especially with respect to periodic review of placement, is likely to have the best results. Protection measures for children at all stages of the legal process has not been sufficiently implemented through children-friendly courts, justice systems and law enforcement agencies. Decriminalization of children exploited in prostitution is a substantial gap in addressing survival sex worldwide. Successful law enforcement partnerships have included a campaign of brothel-based prostitutes who policed the recruitment of under-age girls in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Ennew, J. (November 2008) [http://www.ecpat.net/WorldCongressIII/PDF/Publications/Prostitution_of_Children/Thematic_Paper_Prostitution_ENG.pdf "Exploitation of children in prostitution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329002154/http://www.ecpat.net/WorldCongressIII/PDF/Publications/Prostitution_of_Children/Thematic_Paper_Prostitution_ENG.pdf |date=2012-03-29 }} ''World Congress III Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents'' (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: [[ECPAT]] International)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">In [[microeconomics]], a '''threshold population''' is the minimum number of people needed for a [[Service (economics)|service]] to be worthwhile.

In [[geography]], a threshold population is the minimum number of people necessary before a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] or service can be provided in an area. The concept is equivalent to the "range" in [[central place theory]] and [[retailing]], which delineates the [[Market (economics)|market]] area of a central place for a particular good or service, and is dependent on the [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of population and the willingness of [[consumer]]s to travel a given distance to purchase particular goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a low-order shop (such as a grocer or newsagent) may require only 800 or so customers, whereas a higher-order store such as Marks and Spencer or Waitrose may need a threshold of 70,000 to be profitable, and a university may need 350,000 to be viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html Tiscali encyclopedia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030055/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thresholds may also be linked to the spending power of customers; this is most obvious in periodic markets in poor countries, where wages are so low that people can buy the goods or services only once in a while.

The '''United States Forest Service''' ('''USFS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] that administers the nation's 154 [[United States National Forest|national forests]] and 20 [[United States National Grassland|national grasslands]], which encompass {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/newsroom/by-the-numbers|title=By the Numbers {{!}} US Forest Service|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch.&lt;ref name=organization/&gt; Managing approximately 25% of [[federal lands]], it is the only major national land agency that is outside the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="gao.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=General Accounting Office|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-223|title=Federal Land Management: Observations on a Possible Move of the Forest Service into the Department of the Interior|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the United States Forest Service}}

The concept of the National Forests was born from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation group, [[Boone and Crockett Club]], due to concerns regarding [[Yellowstone National Park]] beginning as early as 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=William G.|title=History of the Boone and Crockett Club Pg 64-80|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1000&amp;context=sheldon&amp;type=additional|website=Scholar Works, University of Montana|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=1 February 2017|ref=Pg. 65-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Congress created the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. [[Franklin B. Hough]] was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed '''Division of Forestry'''. The [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as "forest reserves," managed by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the '''Bureau of Forestry'''. The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the [[General Land Office]] of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry, henceforth known as the '''United States Forest Service'''. [[Gifford Pinchot]] was the first [[United States Chief Foresters|United States Chief Forester]] in the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt]].

Significant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the [[Weeks Act]] of 1911, the [[Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960]], P.L. 86-517; the [[Wilderness Act]], P.L. 88-577; the [[National Forest Management Act]], P.L. 94-588; the [[National Environmental Policy Act]], P.L. 91-190; the [[Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act]], P.L. 95-313; and the [[Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act]], P.L. 95-307.

In February 2009, the [[Government Accountability Office]] evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the [[National Park Service]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], and the [[Bureau of Land Management]], managing some {{convert|438000000|acre|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name="gao.gov"/&gt;

== Organization ==

=== Overview ===
As of 2009, the Forest Service has a total budget authority of $5.5 billion, of which 42% is spent fighting fires. The Forest Service employs 34,250 employees in 750 locations, including 10,050 firefighters, 737 law enforcement personnel, and 500 scientists.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/documents/USFS_An_Overview_0106MJS.pdf|title=The U.S. Forest Service - An Overview|publisher=U.S. Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Forest Service is "To sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations."&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Its motto is "Caring for the land and serving people." As the lead federal agency in natural resource conservation, the US Forest Service provides leadership in the protection, management, and use of the nation's forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems. The agency's ecosystem approach to management integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment to meet current and future needs. Through implementation of land and resource management plans, the agency ensures sustainable ecosystems by restoring and maintaining species diversity and ecological productivity that helps provide recreation, water, timber, minerals, fish, wildlife, wilderness, and aesthetic values for current and future generations of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20heinrich.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clear-Cutting the Truth About Trees | first=Bernd | last=Heinrich | date=December 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday work of the Forest Service balances resource extraction, resource protection, and providing recreation. The work includes managing {{convert|193000000|acres|km2}} of national forest and grasslands, including {{convert|59000000|acres|km2}} of [[roadless area]]s; 14,077 recreation sites; {{convert|143346|mi|km}} of trails; {{convert|374883|mi|km}} of roads; and the harvesting of 1.5 billion trees per year.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Further, the Forest Service fought fires on {{convert|2996000|acres|km2}} of land in 2007.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The Forest Service organization includes ranger districts, national forests, regions, research stations and research work units and the Northeastern Area Office for State and Private Forestry. Each level has responsibility for a variety of functions.

=== National Places ===
The Chief of the Forest Service is a career federal employee who oversees the entire agency. The Chief reports to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), an appointee of the President confirmed by the Senate. The Chief's staff provides broad policy and direction for the agency, works with the Administration to develop a budget to submit to Congress, provides information to Congress on accomplishments, and monitors activities of the agency. There are five deputy chiefs for the following areas: National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Research and Development, Business Operations, and Finance.

=== Research stations and research work units ===
[[File:U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|left|The Forest Products Laboratory, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]
The [[Forest Service Research and Development]] deputy area includes five research stations, the [[Forest Products Laboratory]], and the [[International Institute of Tropical Forestry]], in Puerto Rico. Station directors, like regional foresters, report to the Chief. Research stations include Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southern. There are 92 research work units located at 67 sites throughout the United States. there are 80 Experimental Forests and Ranges that have been established progressively since 1908; many sites are more than 50 years old. The system provides places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types of the {{convert|195|e6acre|km2}} of public land administered by the Forest Service. Individual sites range from 47 to 22,500&amp;nbsp;ha  in size.

Operations of Experimental Forests and Ranges are directed by local research teams for the individual sites, by Research Stations for the regions in which they are located, and at the level of the Forest Service.

Major themes in research at the Experimental Forests and Ranges includes:
develop of systems for managing and restoring forests, range lands, and watersheds; investigate the workings of forest and stream ecosystems; characterize plant and animal communities; observe and interpret long-term environmental change and many other themes.

=== Regions ===
[[File:USFS regions map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the nine regions]]
There are nine regions in the USDA Forest Service; numbered 1 through 10 (Region 7 was eliminated
in 1965 when the current Eastern Region was created from the former Eastern and
North Central regions.&lt;ref&gt;The Land We Cared for... A History of the Forest Service's Eastern Region.
1997, Conrad, David E., Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;
). Each encompasses a broad geographic area and is headed by a regional forester who reports directly to the Chief. The regional forester has broad responsibility for coordinating activities among the various forests within the region, for providing overall leadership for regional natural resource and social programs, and for coordinated regional land use planning.
*'''Northern Region''': based in [[Missoula, Montana]], the Northern Region (R1) covers six states (Montana, Northern Idaho, North Dakota, Northwestern South Dakota, Northeast Washington, and Northwest Wyoming), twelve National Forests and one National Grassland.

* '''Alaska''': based in [[Juneau, Alaska]], the Alaska Region (R10) covers one state (Alaska), and two National Forests.

=== National Forest or Grassland ===
{{further|List of U.S. National Forests|United States National Grassland}}
The Forest Service oversees 155 national forests and 20 grasslands. Each administrative unit typically comprises several ranger districts, under the overall direction of a forest supervisor. Within the supervisor's office, the staff coordinates activities among districts, allocates the budget, and provides technical support to each district. Forest supervisors are line officers and report to regional foresters.

=== Ranger District ===
The Forest Service has over 600 ranger districts. Each district has a staff of 10 to 100 people under the direction of a district ranger, a line officer who reports to a forest supervisor. The districts vary in size from {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}}. Most on-the-ground activities occur on ranger districts, including trail construction and maintenance, operation of campgrounds, and management of vegetation and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;{{USFS|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/organization|article=Agency Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major divisions ==

=== Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations ===
[[File:United States Forest Service LEI Patch.gif|thumb|Patch of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]
[[File:United States Forest Service Horse patrol.jpg|thumb|A horse patrol of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]

The U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit (LEI), headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a [[List of law enforcement agencies|federal law enforcement agency]] of the U.S. government. It is responsible for enforcement of federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. All Law Enforcement Officers and Special Agents Receive their training through [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC).

Operations are divided into two major functional areas:
* Law enforcement: uniformed, high-visibility enforcement of laws
* Investigations: [[special agent]]s who investigate crimes against property, visitors, and employees

Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) enforce federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. LEOs also enforce some or all state laws on National Forest Lands. As part of that mission, LEOs carry firearms, defensive equipment, make arrests, execute [[search warrant]]s, complete reports, and testify in court. They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands, roads, and recreation sites. The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources, protection of Forest Service employees and the protection of visitors. To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction, they use [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, special service [[SUV]]s, horses, [[Police dog|K-9 units]], helicopters, [[snowmobile]]s, dirt bikes, and boats.

[[Special Agents]] are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the Forest Service and other statues under the [[United States Code]]. Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms, and other defensive equipment, make arrests, carry out complex criminal investigations, present cases for prosecution to [[U.S. Attorneys]], and prepare investigative reports. All field agents are required to travel a great deal and usually maintain a case load of ten to fifteen ongoing criminal investigations at one time. Criminal investigators occasionally conduct internal and civil claim investigations.

=== National Forest System ===
[[File:106mm Recoilless Rifle.jpg|thumb|left|Forest Service team uses a 106&amp;nbsp;mm [[Recoilless Rifle]] for [[avalanche control]] at [[Mammoth Mountain]] in the [[Inyo National Forest]] in [[California]]. Note the [[Minarets (California)|Minarets]] in background.]]
The {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}} of public land that are managed as national forests and [[grassland]]s are collectively known as the National Forest System. These lands are located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, and the [[Virgin Islands]] and comprise about 9% of the total land area in the United States. The lands are organized into 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands. The mission of the National Forest System is to protect and manage the forest lands so they best demonstrate the sustainable multiple-use management concept, using an ecological approach, to meet the diverse needs of people.

=== State and Private Forestry ===
The mission of the State and Private Forestry program is to provide technical and financial assistance to private landowners, state agencies, tribes, and community resource managers to help sustain the United States' urban and rural forests and to protect communities and the environment from wildland fires, insects, disease, and [[Invasive species|invasive]] plants. The program employs approximately 537 staff located at 17 sites throughout the country. The delivery of the State and Private Forestry program is carried out by eight National Forest System regions and the Northeastern Area.

=== Research and development ===
[[File:USFS PNW lab.jpg|thumb|right|The U.S. Forest Service [[R&amp;D]] lab in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington]]
The [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service works to improve the health and use of the United States' forests and [[grassland]]s. Research has been part of the Forest Service mission since the agency's inception in 1905. Today, Forest Service researchers work in a range of biological, physical, and social science fields to promote sustainable management of United States' diverse forests and rangelands. Research employs about 550 scientists and several hundred technical and support staff, located at 67 sites throughout the United States and in [[Puerto Rico]]. Discovery and technology development and transfer is carried out through seven research stations.

Research focuses on informing policy and land management decisions and includes addressing [[Invasive species|invasive]] insects, degraded [[river ecosystem]]s, or sustainable ways to harvest forest products. The researchers work independently and with a range of partners, including other agencies, academia, nonprofit groups, and industry. The information and technology produced through basic and applied science programs is available to the public for its benefit and use.

In addition to the Research Stations, the USFS R&amp;D branch also leads several National Centers such as the [[National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation]].

=== International programs ===
The Forest Service plays a key role in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources. It works closely with other agencies such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]], and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], as well as with nonprofit development organizations, wildlife organizations, universities, and international assistance organizations. The Forest Service's international work serves to link people and communities striving to protect and manage forests throughout the world. The program also promotes [[sustainable land management]] overseas and brings important technologies and innovations back to the United States.

Although a large volume of [[Lumber|timber]] is [[Logging|logged]] every year, not all [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] are entirely forested. There are tidewater glaciers in the [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] and ski areas such as [[Alta, Utah]] in the [[Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. In addition, the Forest Service is responsible for managing [[National Grassland]]s in the midwest. Furthermore, areas designated as wilderness by acts of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], prohibit logging, mining, road and building construction and land leases for purposes of farming and or livestock grazing.

Since 1978, several [[President of the United States|Presidents]] have directed the USFS to administer  [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]] inside of preexisting National Forests.

* [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] – California
* [[Misty Fjords National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] – Washington
* [[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] – Oregon
* [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] – California (jointly with the [[Bureau of Land Management]])

The Forest Service also manages [[Grey Towers National Historic Site]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], the home and estate of its first Chief, [[Gifford Pinchot]].

=== Fighting fires ===

[[File:Smokey3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Smokey Bear]] poster]]

In August 1944, to reduce the number of [[wildfire|forest fires]],  the Forest Service and the [[Wartime Advertising Council]] began distributing fire education posters featuring a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The poster campaign was a success; the black bear would later be named "[[Smokey Bear]]", and would, for decades, be the "spokesbear" for the Forest Service.  Smokey Bear has appeared in innumerable TV commercials;  his popular catch phrase, "Only YOU can prevent forest fires", is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the United States. A recent study found that 95% of the people surveyed could complete the phrase when given the first few words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129032801/http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fireprevention/smokeybear.php?p=1.1.3.4 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |title=The Story of Smokey Bear |publisher=United States Forest Service |accessdate=2008-01-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In September 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000, to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. The report is entitled "Managing the Impacts of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment: A Report to the President In Response to the Wildfires of 2000"—The National Fire Plan for short. The National Fire Plan continues to be an integral part of the Forest Service today. The following are important operational features of the National Fire Plan:
*Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy: The 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and the subsequent 2001 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy act as the foundation of the National Fire Plan.
*Basic Premise of the National Fire Plan: Investing now in an optimal firefighting force, hazardous fuels reduction, and overall community protection will provide for immediate protection and future cost savings.
*Funding: Initially (2001), the National Fire Plan provided for an additional $1,100,994,000 for the Forest Service for a total wildland fire management budget of $1,910,193,000. In 2008, the total amount for the Forest Service in wildland fire management (not including emergency fire suppression funding) is $1,974,276,000.

In August 2014, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, announced that the agency will have to put $400 to $500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends. The decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken, but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freking|first1=Kevin|title=MONEY ALLOCATED FOR FIGHTING FIRES TO RUN OUT|url=http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/california/2014/08/05/money-allocated-fighting-fires-run/13636869/|work=Associated Press|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Bray Lassie 1967.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[Lassie]] with [[Robert Bray]] as U.S. Forest Ranger [[Corey Stuart]]]]
The U.S. Forest Service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s, as it became the setting for the long running classic TV show ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', with storylines focusing on Lassie's adventures with various forest rangers.&lt;ref name="jcs" /&gt;

The iconic collie's association with the Forest Service led to Lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the [[U.S. Senate]] and the Department of Agriculture, and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], which was dubbed by some as "The Lassie Program".&lt;ref name="jcs"&gt;{{cite web

== Controversies ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The history of the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests. These values and resources include [[grazing]], [[Lumber|timber]], [[mining]], [[recreation]], wildlife habitat, and [[wilderness]]. Because of continuing development elsewhere, the large size of National Forests have made them de facto wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species. In recent decades, the importance of mature forest for the [[spotted owl]] and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels.

In the 1990s, the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as [[airtanker]]s. (See [[U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal]].)

Another controversial issue is the policy on road building within the National Forests. In 1999, President Clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the National Forests to "assess their ecological, economic, and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=091000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;ttype=roadmain&amp;cid=FSE_003853&amp;position=RELATEDLINKS&amp;pname=Roadless-Home|work=Roadless Area Conservation|title=Home|publisher=US Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five and half years later, the Bush administration replaced this with a system where each state could petition the Forest Service to open forests in their territory to road building.

Some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 draft report describing the legal basis which provides federal land managers a scope of decision making authority exceeding that of state fish and game departments has proven unexpectedly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/forest-service-tried-to-quash-paper-debunking-montana-wildlife-authority/article_91ef1437-4df9-5ea0-8667-728e6f63ae91.html|title=Forest Service tried to quash paper debunking Montana wildlife authority|last=Chaney|first=Rob|date=2017-09-25|work=[[Missoulian]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4233">VOCs ([[volatile organic compounds]]) are a dangerous contaminant of [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]].  They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices.

==Overview==
[[Volatile organic compounds|VOCs]] are responsible for a number of adverse health effects especially for [[breastfeeding|nursing]] and [[pregnant]] mothers.  Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of [[groundwater]] identified these substances in drinking water sources.

==Specific VOCs==
===PCE===
[[Tetrachloroethylene]] is used in metal degreasing and dry cleaning.  It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===TCE===
[[Trichloroethylene]] is used in cleaning metal parts and was widely believed to be harmless before being linked to [[birth defects]]. It is a suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems.

===Toluene===
[[Toluene]] is an organic compound which is mostly harmless to adults and is sometimes abused as an [[inhalant]].  [[Fetal toluene syndrome]] has been defined and resembles [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] with resultant [[birth defects]], but the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have identified differentiating features between the two [[syndrome]]s including FTS having the additional facial features of [[micrognathia]], large anterior [[fontanel]], down-turned mouth  corners, hair patterning abnormalities, bifrontal narrowing of the face, and ear abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. (2004). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis''. Can be downloaded at https://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505061132/http://www.cdc.gov/fas/faspub.htm |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Camp Lejeune===
{{Details|Camp Lejeune water contamination}}
U.S. Marine Corps Base [[Camp Lejeune]] was built near [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]] in 1942.  In 1982, the Marine Corps discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in several drinking water wells that fed into two of the eight water systems.  The sources were traced to [[Tetrachloroethylene]] (PCE) from a two dry cleaners - one on base, the other off the base and [[Trichloroethylene]] which had been used in vehicle maintenance on the base.  These problems were addressed but there were concerns with nursing and pregnant mothers who may have been exposed previously.  It wasn't until the late 1990s that the federal government tried to track down people who may have been exposed.

===Love Canal===
{{main|Love Canal}}
[[Love Canal]] was an abandoned canal near [[Niagara Falls, New York]] which was used by the [[U.S. military]] and [[Occidental Petroleum]] as a [[chemical waste]] dumping ground.  Numerous cases of cancer and birth defects were found from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The primary VOC at Love Canal is [[toluene]], which is found along with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s and other [[pollutants]].

===Valley of the Drums===
{{main|Valley of the Drums}}
The [[Valley of the Drums]] is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} toxic waste site in northern Bullitt County, Kentucky, near Louisville, named after the waste-containing drums strewn across the area. Contaminants include 
[[xylene]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]], 
[[methylene chloride]],
[[acetone]],
[[phthalates]],
[[anthracene]],
[[toluene]],
[[fluoranthene]],
[[alkyl benzene]],
[[vinyl chloride]],
[[dichloroethylene]], and [[aliphatic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known as one of the primary motivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980.

{{distinguish|text=[[John DeFrancis|Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems]]}}

'''Visible Speech''' is  a system of phonetic symbols developed by [[Alexander Melville Bell]] in 1867 to represent the position of the speech organs in articulating sounds. Bell was known internationally as a teacher of speech and proper [[elocution]] and an author of books on the subject.  The system is composed of symbols that show the position and movement of the throat, tongue, and lips as they produce the sounds of language, and it is a type of [[phonetic transcription|phonetic notation]].  The system was used to aid the deaf in learning to speak.

In 1864 Melville promoted his first works on Visible Speech, in order to help the deaf both learn and improve upon their speech (since the profoundly deaf could not hear their own pronunciation).&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.192&lt;/ref&gt; To help promote the language, Bell created two written short forms using his system of 29 modifiers and tones, 52 [[consonant]]s, 36 [[vowel]]s and a dozen [[diphthong]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.193&lt;/ref&gt; they were named [[International English|World English]], which was similar to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and also Line Writing, used as a shorthand form for [[stenographer]]s.&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville's works on Visible Speech became highly notable, and were described by [[Édouard Séguin]] as being "...a greater invention than [[invention of the telephone|the telephone]] by his son, [[Alexander Graham Bell]]".&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"/&gt; Melville saw numerous applications for his invention, including its worldwide use as a [[universal language]].  However, although heavily promoted at the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf]] in Milan, Italy in 1880, after a period of a dozen years or so in which it was applied to the education of the deaf, Visible Speech was found to be more cumbersome, and thus a hindrance, to the teaching of speech to the deaf, compared to other methods,&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.195–203&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually faded from use.

Bell's son [[Alexander Graham Bell]] learned the symbols, assisted his father in giving public demonstrations of the system and mastered it to the point that he later improved upon his father's work.  Eventually, Alexander Graham Bell became a powerful advocate of visible speech and [[oralism]] in the United States.  The money he earned from his patent of the [[telephone]] and the sale of his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] [[Volta_Laboratory_and_Bureau#Laboratory_patents|patents]] helped him to pursue this mission.

== The early years ==

In 1867, Alexander Melville Bell published the book ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''. This book contains information about the system of symbols he created that, when used to write words, indicated pronunciation so accurately, that it could even reflect regional accents.&lt;ref name="PKK"&gt;Potter, Kopp, and Kopp, 1966. ''Visible Speech''.&lt;/ref&gt; A person reading a piece of text handwritten in Melville Bell's system of characters could accurately reproduce a sentence the way it would be spoken by someone with a foreign or regional accent. In his demonstrations, Melville Bell employed his son, Alexander Graham Bell to read from the visible speech transcript of the volunteer's spoken words and would astound the audience by saying it back exactly as the volunteer had spoken it.

A few samples of the writing system invented by Melville Bell may be seen in the images on this page. These images depict Melville Bell's intention of creating a script in which the characters actually look like the position of the mouth when speaking them out loud. The system is useful not only because its visual representation mimicks the physical act of speaking, but because it does so, these symbols may be used to write words in any language, hence the name "Universal Alphabetics".&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Melville Bell, 1867. ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville Bell's system was effective at helping deaf people improve their pronunciation, but his son Graham Bell decided to improve upon his father's invention by creating a system of writing that was even more accurate and employed the most advanced technology of the time.

== A fresh take on pronunciation for the deaf ==

Alexander Graham Bell later devised another system of visual cues that also came to be known as visible speech, yet this system did not use symbols written on paper to teach deaf people how to pronounce words. Instead, Graham Bell's system, developed at his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., involved the use of a [[spectrogram]], a device that makes "visible records of the frequency, intensity, and time analysis of short samples of speech".&lt;ref name="PKK"/&gt; The spectrogram translated sounds into readable patterns via a photographic process. This system was based on the idea that the eye should be able to read patterns of vocalizations in much the same way that the ear translates these vocalizations into meaning. [[Spectrogram|Modern implementations]] of Bell's idea display sound spectra in real time and are used in [[phonology]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Crowhurst, Phonology case studies, University of Texas at Austin 2006 [http://www.laits.utexas.edu/phonology/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[speech therapy]] and [[computer speech recognition]].

== Method ==

The idea of the use of a [[spectrograph]] to translate speech into a visual representation was created in the hopes of enabling the deaf to use a telephone.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Kopp, 1967. ''Visible Speech Manual''.&lt;/ref&gt; If the sounds could be translated into something readable, then a deaf person at the receiving end could then read out the pattern of speech to determine its meaning without having to hear what was said. The spectrograph readings could also be used to teach pronunciation by having a person speak into the spectrograph and watch a small television-like screen to monitor the precision of their utterances.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''World Uranium Hearing''' was held in [[Salzburg, Austria]] in September 1992. [[Anti-nuclear]] speakers from all continents, including indigenous speakers and scientists, testified to the health and environmental problems of [[uranium mining]] and processing, [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear tests]], and [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/hearing.htm |title=World Uranium Hearing, a Look Back |author= [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]]  |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who spoke at the 1992 Hearing include: [[Thomas Banyacya]], [[Katsumi Furitsu]], [[Manuel Pino]] and [[Floyd Red Crow Westerman]]. They said they were deeply dismayed by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and highlighted what they called the inherently destructive nature of all phases of the nuclear supply chain. They recalled the disastrous impact of nuclear weapons testing in places such as the [[Nevada Test Site]], [[Bikini Atoll]] and [[Eniwetok]], [[Tahiti]], [[Maralinga]], and [[Central Asia]]. They highlighted the threat of [[radioactive contamination]] to all peoples, especially indigenous communities and said that their survival requires self-determination and emphasis on spiritual and cultural values. Increased [[renewable energy commercialization]] was advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclear-free.com/english/salzburg.htm |title=The Declaration of Salzberg |author= [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]]  |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Worldbuilding''' is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name=hamilton2009/&gt; The resulting world may be called a '''constructed world'''. Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a [[history]], [[Fictional geography|geography]], and [[ecology]] is a key task for many science fiction or [[fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian M. |last=Stableford |year=2004 |title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0-8108-4938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldbuilding often involves the creation of [[Fantasy map|map]]s, a [[backstory]], and people for the world.  Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and [[Cognitive training|mental exercise]], or for specific creative endeavors such as [[novel]]s, [[video game]]s, or [[role-playing game]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term "world-building" was first used in the ''Edinburgh Review'' in December 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in A.S. Eddington's ''Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory'' (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddington|first1=Arthur Stanley|title=Space, Time and Gravitation : an outline of the general relativity theory|date=1920|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegravita00eddirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used in [[science fiction]] and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoff’s ''Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199891405|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|editor=Jeff Prucher|page=270|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of literary fictional worlds was first examined by fantasy authors such as [[George MacDonald]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[C. S. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="MarkWolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation|author=Mark J.P. Wolf|isbn=9781136220814|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien addressed the issue in his essay ''On Fairy Stories'', where he stated that the "Secondary World" or "Sub-Creation" (the constructed world) is substantially different from the art of play-writing: "Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories"&gt;{{citation|title=On Fairy Stories|author=J. R. R. Tolkien|work=The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pp=109–161|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed worlds shift away from storytelling, narrative, characters and figures, and may explore "trees as trees" or aspects of the world in-and-of-themselves. Later analysis of fantasy worlds in the 1960s contextualized them in the medium or the narrative of the works, offering an analysis of the stories in the world, but not the world itself. [[Media franchise]]s are similar to constructed worlds but do not necessarily rely on them; for example a media franchise such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' has a constructed world, while [[The Beatles]], as a franchise, does not. In the 2000s, world-building in film has increased in popularity. When before, writers sought to create a character that could sustain multiple stories, now they create a world that can sustain multiple characters and stories.&lt;ref name="MarkWolf" /&gt;

==Methods==
Worldbuilding can be designed from [[Top-down and bottom-up design|the top down or the bottom up]], or by a combination of these approaches. The official world-building guidelines for ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' refer to these terms as "outside-in" and "inside-out", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first1=Monte |last1=Cook |authorlink1=Monte Cook |first2=Jonathan |last2=Tweet |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet |first3=Skip |last3=Williams |authorlink3=Skip Williams |others=revised by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] |year=2003 |title=[[Dungeon Master's Guide]] |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |isbn=0-7869-2889-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the top-down approach, the [[designer]] first creates a general overview of the world, determining broad characteristics such as the world's inhabitants, [[technology]] level, major geographic features, [[climate]], and history. From there, he or she develops the rest of the world in increasing detail. This approach might involve creation of the world's basics, followed by levels such as [[continent]]s, [[civilization]]s, [[Fictional country|nation]]s, [[Fictional city|cities]], and [[town]]s. A world constructed from the top down tends to be well-integrated, with individual components fitting together appropriately. It can, however, require considerable work before enough detail is completed for the setting to be useful, such as in the setting of a story.

With the bottom-up approach, the designer focuses on a small part of the world needed for his or her purposes. This location is given considerable detail, such as local geography, [[culture]], [[social structure]], [[government]], [[politics]], [[commerce]], and history. Prominent local individuals may be described, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] to each other. The surrounding areas are then described in a lower level of detail, with description growing more general with increasing distance from the initial location. The designer can subsequently enhance the description of other areas in the world. This approach provides for almost immediate applicability of the setting, with details pertinent to a certain story or situation. The approach can yield a world plagued with [[Consistency|inconsistencies]], however. By combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches, a designer can enjoy the benefits of both. This is very hard to accomplish, however, because the need to start from both sides creates twice as much work, which may delay the desired product.

Despite requiring considerable work to develop enough detail for a setting to be useful, not every aspect of a setting can be explored, and instead an approach called inferred world building is often used. Inferred world building is when the author provides enough detail about the various parts of a setting that readers can extrapolate on what is written to come to their own conclusions regarding specific details that weren't provided. This is especially useful for roleplaying game settings, as individual games may require certain details to be created on a case-by-case basis for the RPG's story to function.

==Elements==
From a game-design perspective, the goal of worldbuilding is to create the context for a story. Consistency is an important element, since the world provides a foundation for the action of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francois Dominic |last=Laramee |year=2002 |title=Game design perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |isbn=1-58450-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. R. Tolkien described the goal of worldbuilding as creating immersion, or "enchantment" as he put it, and descriptions of the world can be wholly disconnected from the story and narrative.&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories" /&gt;

An uninhabited world can be useful for certain purposes, especially in science fiction, but the majority of constructed worlds have one or more [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. These species can have [[constructed culture]]s and [[constructed language]]s. Designers in [[hard science fiction]] may design [[flora]] and [[fauna]] towards the end of the worldbuilding process, thus creating lifeforms with environmental adaptations to scientifically novel situations.

===Physics===
Perhaps the most basic consideration of worldbuilding is to what degree a fictional world will be based on real-world [[physics]] compared to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. While magic is a more common element of fantasy settings, science fiction worlds can contain magic or technological equivalents of it. For example, the Biotics in the science fiction video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' have abilities, described scientifically in-game, which mirror those of [[Magician (fantasy)|mages]] in fantasy games. In the science fiction novel ''[[Midnight at the Well of Souls]]'', magic exists, but is explained scientifically.

Some fictional worlds modify the real-world [[Physical law|laws of physics]]; [[faster-than-light]] travel is a common factor in much science fiction. Worldbuilding may combine physics and magic, such as in the ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

===Cosmology===
Constructed worlds often have cosmologies, both in the [[Physical cosmology|scientific]] and [[Religious cosmology|metaphysical]] senses of the word. Design of science fiction worlds, especially those with [[spacefaring]] societies, usually entails creation of a [[star system]] and [[planet]]s. If the designer wishes to apply real-life principles of astronomy, he or she may develop detailed [[Astronomy|astronomical]] measures for the [[orbit]] of the world, and to define the physical characteristics of the other bodies in the same system; this establishes [[Chronology|chronological]] parameters, such as the length of a day and the durations of [[season]]s.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book |first=Poul |last=Anderson |authorlink=Poul Anderson |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Worlds |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are intentionally bizarre. For [[Larry Niven]]'s novels ''[[The Integral Trees]]'' and ''[[The Smoke Ring (novel)|The Smoke Ring]]'', Niven designed a "freefall" environment, a gas [[torus]] ring of habitable pressure, temperature, and composition, around a [[neutron star]].

Fantasy worlds can also involve unique cosmologies. In ''Dungeons and Dragons'', the physical world is referred to as the Prime Material Plane, but other planes of existence devoted to moral or elemental concepts are available for play, such as the [[Spelljammer]] setting, which provides an entirely novel fantasy astrophysical system. Some fantasy worlds feature religions. The ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series, for example, contains a variety of religions practiced by its world's various races. The world of the 2000 video game ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' has a well-developed cosmology, including a [[creation myth]].

===Geography{{anchor|Map making}}===
Map construction is often one of the earliest tasks of worldbuilding. Maps can lay out a world's basic [[terrain]] features and significant civilizations present. A clear, concise map that displays the locations of key points in the story can be a helpful tool for developers and audiences alike. Finished creative products, such as books, may contain published versions of development maps; many editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for example, include maps of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cartography]] of fictional worlds is sometimes called ''geofiction''.&lt;ref name=map_hacks2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Schuyler |last1=Erle |first2=Rich |last2=Gibson |first3=Jo |last3=Walsh |isbn=0-596-00703-5 |page=508 |title=Mapping hacks: tips &amp; tools for electronic cartography |series=Hacks Series |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiO5JtP171oC&amp;pg=PA508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physical geography]] of a fictional world is important in designing [[weather]] patterns and [[biome]]s such as [[desert]]s, [[wetlands]], [[mountain]]s, and [[forest]]s. These physical features also affect the growth and interaction of the various societies, such as the establishment of [[trade route]]s and locations of important cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven S. |last=Long |year=2002 |title=Fantasy HERO |pages=290&amp;ndash;294 |edition=[[Hero System]] Fifth |publisher=DOJ |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58366-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for control of [[natural resource]]s in a fictional world may lead to [[war]] among its people. Geography can also define [[ecosystem]]s for each biome. Often, Earth-like ecology is assumed, but designers can vary drastically from this trend. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[short story]] "[[The Talking Stone]]" features a life form based on [[silicon]], rather than [[Carbon-based life|carbon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Clement |authorlink=Hal Clement |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Beings |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[software]] programs can create random terrain using [[fractal]] algorithms. Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plate movement and [[erosion]]; the resulting world can be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in great detail, providing a degree of realism to the result.

===Culture===
Constructed cultures, or concultures, are a typical element of worldbuilding. Worldbuilders sometimes employ past human civilizations as a model for fictional societies. The 1990 video game ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire]]'', for example, takes place in a world full of [[tribe]]s based on civilizations in early [[Mesoamerica]] and Africa. This method can make a fictional world more accessible for an audience. ''Simon Provencher'' has stated as a 'Golden Rule' of Worldbuilding that "... unless specified otherwise, everything inside your world is assumed to behave exactly as it would in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provencher|first=Simon|title=The Golden Rule of Worldbuilding|url=http://www.worldbuilderblog.com/the-golden-rule-of-worldbuilding/|work=Worldbuilder|publisher=Simon Provencher|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven S. Long]], a representative of the [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] role-playing game, who stated that "Everything that happened in the real world has also unfolded in the exact same way in the Champions Universe." This means any past wars, elections, and technological advancements in our world occurred the same way in the Champions Universe unless explained otherwise.  Creating a cohesive [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture can be a distinct challenge. Some designers have also looked to human civilizations for inspiration in doing so, such as ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, whose society resembles that of [[Ancient Rome]]. The fictional world's history can explain past and present relationships between different societies, which can introduce a story's action. A past war, for example, functions as a key plot point in the ''[[Shannara]]'' and ''[[Belgariad]]'' series.

==Types of constructed worlds==
Examples of constructed worlds include [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the pseudo-Earth [[Hyborian Age]] in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan series]], Arrakis in the ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series, the continent of [[Tamriel]] in the [[Elder Scrolls]] series of games,  [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and [[Gethen]], the Subcontinent of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the location of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Constructed worlds are not always limited to one type of story. [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] and [[Steven Brust]] created [[Ethshar]] and [[Dragaera]], respectively, for role-playing games before using them as settings for novels. [[M. A. R. Barker]] originally designed [[Tékumel]] well before the advent of role-playing games, but many [[gamer]]s, including Barker himself, have used it as a setting for such games.

A [[shared universe]] is a fictional universe that can be used by different authors. Examples of shared universes include the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] and [[campaign setting]] developed specifically for role-playing games. One of the oldest of these is [[Oerth]], developed for the Dungeons and Dragons [[Greyhawk]] setting. [[Forgotten Realms]] is another such D&amp;D setting, originally a [[House rule#Gaming|homebrew]] campaign world by [[Ed Greenwood]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15952">{{distinguish|Wetting#Ideal_solid_surfaces{{!}}Young's equation for surface wetting|Laplace's equation}}

In [[physics]], the '''Young–Laplace equation''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|p|l|ɑː|s}}) is a [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]] that describes the [[capillary pressure]] difference sustained across the interface between two [[fluid statics|static fluids]], such as [[water]] and [[air]], due to the phenomenon of [[surface tension]] or [[wall tension]], although usage on the latter is only applicable if assuming that the wall is very thin. The Young–Laplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall and it is fundamentally important in the study of static [[capillary surface]]s. It is a statement of [[normal stress]] balance for static fluids meeting at an interface, where the interface is treated as a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] (zero thickness):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta p &amp;= -\gamma \nabla \cdot \hat n \\
&amp;= 2 \gamma H \\
&amp;= \gamma \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace pressure]], the pressure difference across the fluid interface, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] (or [[wall tension]]), &lt;math&gt;\hat n&lt;/math&gt; is the unit normal pointing out of the surface, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean curvature]], and &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; are the principal [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]]. (Some authors{{who|date=April 2012}} refer inappropriately to the factor &lt;math&gt;2H&lt;/math&gt; as the [[total curvature]].) Note that only normal stress is considered, this is because it can be shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/1.63/www/Lec-notes/Surfacetension/ Surface Tension Module], by John W. M. Bush, at [[MIT OCW]].&lt;/ref&gt; that a static interface is possible only in the absence of tangential stress.

The equation is named after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], who developed the qualitative theory of surface tension in 1805, and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] who completed the mathematical description in the following year. It is sometimes also called the Young–Laplace–Gauss equation, as [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] unified the work of Young and Laplace in 1830, deriving both the differential equation and boundary conditions using [[Johann Bernoulli]]'s [[virtual work]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Soap films==
{{main|Soap film}}
If the pressure difference is zero, as in a soap film without gravity, the interface will assume the shape of a [[minimal surface]].

==Emulsions==
The equation also explains the energy required to create an [[emulsion]]. To form the small, highly curved droplets of an emulsion, extra energy is required to overcome the large pressure that results from their small radius.

==Capillary pressure in a tube==
[[File:Spherical meniscus.PNG|thumb|180px|right|Spherical meniscus with wetting angle less than 90°]]
In a sufficiently narrow (i.e., low [[Bond number]]) tube of circular cross-section (radius ''a''), the interface between two fluids forms a [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] that is a portion of the surface of a sphere with radius ''R''. The pressure jump across this surface is related to the radius and the surface tension γ by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{2 \gamma}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

This may be shown by writing the Young–Laplace equation in spherical form with a [[contact angle]] boundary condition and also a prescribed height boundary condition at, say, the bottom of the meniscus. The solution is a portion of a sphere, and the solution will exist ''only'' for the pressure difference shown above. This is significant because there isn't another equation or law to specify the pressure difference; [[Partial differential equation#Existence and uniqueness|existence]] of solution for one specific value of the pressure difference prescribes it.

The radius of the sphere will be a function only of the [[contact angle]], θ, which in turn depends on the exact properties of the fluids and the solids in which they are in contact:
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{a}{\cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the pressure difference may be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{2 \gamma \cos \theta}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:CapillaryAction.svg|thumb|180px|right|Illustration of capillary rise. Red=contact angle less than 90°; blue=contact angle greater than 90°]]

In order to maintain [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], the induced '''capillary pressure''' is balanced by a change in height, ''h'', which can be positive or negative, depending on whether the wetting angle is less than or greater than 90°. For a fluid of [[density]] ρ:
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{2 \gamma \cos \theta}{\rho g a}.&lt;/math&gt;

— where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. This is sometimes known as the '''[[Jurin's law|Jurin rule]]''' or '''Jurin height'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Jurin rule|work=McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill on Answers.com|accessdate=2007-09-05|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jurin-rule?cat=technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[James Jurin]] who studied the effect in 1718.&lt;ref name="jurin"&gt;See:
*  James Jurin (1718) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NUVFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA739#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An account of some experiments shown before the Royal Society; with an enquiry into the cause of some of the ascent and suspension of water in capillary tubes,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''30''' : 739–747.
*  James Jurin (1719) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NUVFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1083#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An account of some new experiments, relating to the action of glass tubes upon water and quicksilver,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''30''' : 1083–1096.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a water-filled glass tube in [[air]] at [[sea level]]:

{|
|γ = 0.0728 J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 °[[celsius|C]]
|''θ'' = 20° (0.35 [[radian|rad]])
|-
|''ρ'' = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|''g'' = 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

— and so the height of the water column is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;h\approx {{1.4 \times 10^{-5}}\over a}&lt;/math&gt; [[metre|m]].
Thus for a 2&amp;nbsp;mm wide (1&amp;nbsp;mm radius) tube, the water would rise 14&amp;nbsp;mm. However, for a capillary tube with radius 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, the water would rise 14&amp;nbsp;cm (about 6 [[inch]]es).

== Capillary action in general ==
In the general case, for a [[free surface]] and where there is an applied "over-pressure", Δ''p'', at the interface in equilibrium, there is a balance between the applied pressure, the [[hydrostatic pressure]] and the effects of surface tension. The '''Young–Laplace''' equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \rho g h  - \gamma \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be [[Nondimensionalization|non-dimensionalised]] in terms of its characteristic length-scale, the [[capillary length]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\rho g}},&lt;/math&gt;

— and '''characteristic pressure''':
:&lt;math&gt;p_{c} = \frac {\gamma}  {L_{c}} = \sqrt{ \gamma \rho g}.&lt;/math&gt;

For clean water at [[standard temperature and pressure]], the '''capillary length''' is ~2 [[millimeter|mm]].

The non-dimensional equation then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;h^*- \Delta p^*= \left( \frac{1}{{R_1}^{*}} + \frac{1}{{R_2}^{*}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the surface shape is determined by only one parameter, the over pressure of the fluid, Δ''p''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and the scale of the surface is given by the '''capillary length'''. The solution of the equation requires an initial condition for position, and the gradient of the surface at the start point.

===Axisymmetric equations===
The (nondimensional) shape, ''r''(''z'')  of an [[axisymmetric]] surface can be found by substituting general expressions for [[curvature]] to give the [[hydrostatic]] '''Young–Laplace equations''':&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H. Statics, Including Hydrostatics and the Elements of the Theory of Elasticity, 3rd ed. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{r''}{(1+r'^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} - \frac{1}{r(z) \sqrt{1+r'^2} } = z - \Delta p^*&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
[[Francis Hauksbee]] performed some of the earliest observations and experiments in 1709&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Francis Hauksbee, ''Physico-mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects'' … (London, England:  (Self-published by author; printed by R. Brugis), 1709), pages 139–169.
*  Francis Hauksbee (1711) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324351053;view=1up;seq=437;start=1;size=10;page=search;num=374#view=1up;seq=437 "An account of an experiment touching the direction of a drop of oil of oranges, between two glass planes, towards any side of them that is nearest press'd together,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''27''' : 374–375. 
*  Francis Hauksbee (1712) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324351053;view=1up;seq=437;start=1;size=10;page=search;num=541#view=1up;seq=589 "An account of an experiment touching the ascent of water between two glass planes, in an hyperbolick figure,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''27''' : 539–540.&lt;/ref&gt; and these were repeated in 1718 by [[James Jurin]] who observed that the height of fluid in a capillary column was a function only of the cross-sectional area at the surface, not of any other dimensions of the column.&lt;ref name="jurin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebca"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Capillary Action |volume=5 |pages=256–275|first1=James Clerk |last1=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |first2=John William |last2=Strutt |author2link=John William Strutt|short=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] laid the foundations of the equation in his 1804 paper ''An Essay on the Cohesion of Fluids''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Young (1805) [https://books.google.com/books?id=C5JJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An essay on the cohesion of fluids,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''95''' : 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; where he set out in descriptive terms the principles governing contact between fluids (along with many other aspects of fluid behaviour).  [[Pierre Simon Laplace]] followed this up in ''Mécanique Céleste''&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Simon marquis de Laplace, ''Traité de Mécanique Céleste'', volume 4, (Paris, France:  Courcier, 1805), ''Supplément au dixième livre du Traité de Mécanique Céleste'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 1–79].&lt;/ref&gt; with the formal mathematical description given above, which reproduced in symbolic terms the relationship described earlier by Young.

Laplace accepted the idea propounded by Hauksbee in his book ''Physico-mechanical Experiments'' (1709), that the phenomenon was due to a force of attraction that was insensible at sensible distances.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Simon marquis de Laplace, ''Traité de Mécanique Céleste'', volume 4, (Paris, France:  Courcier, 1805), ''Supplément au dixième livre du Traité de Mécanique Céleste''.  On [https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 2 of the ''Supplément''], Laplace states that capillary action is due to ''"… les lois dans lesquelles l'attraction n'est sensible qu'à des distances insensibles; …"'' (… the laws in which attraction is sensible [significant] only at insensible [infinitesimal] distances …).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1751, [[Johann Andreas Segner]] came to the same conclusion that Hauksbee had reached in 1709:  J. A. von Segner (1751) [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/dms/loader/img/?PPN=PPN352829796_0001&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0042 "De figuris superficierum fluidarum"] (On the shapes of liquid surfaces), ''Commentarii Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis'' (Memoirs of the Royal Scientific Society at Göttingen), '''1''' : 301–372.  On page 303, Segner proposes that liquids are held together by an attractive force (''vim attractricem'') that acts over such short distances "that no one could yet have perceived it with their senses" (… ''ut nullo adhuc sensu percipi poterit.'').&lt;/ref&gt; The part which deals with the action of a [[solid]] on a [[liquid]] and the mutual action of two liquids was not worked out thoroughly, but ultimately was completed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Gauss, ''Principia generalia Theoriae Figurae Fluidorum in statu Aequilibrii'' [General principles of the theory of fluid shapes in a state of equilibrium] (Göttingen, (Germany):  Dieterichs, 1830).
