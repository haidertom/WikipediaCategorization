      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5812">[[File:Château de Versailles, salon des nobles, Pygmalion priant Vénus d'animer sa statue, Jean-Baptiste Regnault.jpg|thumb|''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], 1786, [[Musée national du château et des Trianons]]]]
'''Agalmatophilia''' (from the Greek ''agalma'' 'statue', and -philia φιλία = love) is a [[paraphilia]] involving sexual attraction to a [[statue]], [[doll]], [[mannequin]] or other similar figurative object. The attraction may include a desire for actual sexual contact with the object, a fantasy of having sexual (or non-sexual) encounters with an animate or inanimate instance of the preferred object, the act of watching encounters between such objects, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into the preferred object. Agalmatophilia may also encompass ''Pygmalionism'' (from the [[mythology|myth]] of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]), which denotes love for an object of one's own creation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical study==
Agalmatophilia became a subject of clinical study with the publication of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''. Krafft-Ebing recorded an 1877 case of a gardener falling in love with a statue of the [[Venus de Milo]] and being discovered attempting [[coitus]] with it.&lt;ref&gt;Kick, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fantasy, transformation, role-play==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
An important fantasy for some individuals is being transformed into the preferred object (such as a statue) and experiencing an associated state of immobility or paralysis. Such fantasies may be extended to role-playing, and the self-coined term used by [[Sexual fetishism|fetishists]] who enjoy being transformed into what appears to be a "rubber doll" or "latex doll" or trapped within a statue and displayed in a museum.

==In the arts==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Sexualised life-size dolls have extensively featured in the work of famous art photographers such as [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Bernard Faucon]], [[Helmut Newton]], [[Morton Bartlett]], Katan Amano, Kishin Shinoyama,&lt;ref&gt;http://shinoyama.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ryoichi Yoshida]].

Agalmatophilia features prominently in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'', in which the female protagonist sucks a statue's toe; in the 1962 novel ''Kort Amerikaans'' ("Crew Cut") by Dutch writer [[Jan Wolkers]] (and the movie of the same name, based on the novel, from 1979), in which the main character (in the movie played by [[Derek de Lint]]) develops an interest in, and ultimately is caught having sex with, a plaster torso; as well as in [[Tarsem Singh]]'s 2000 [[Thriller film|thriller]] movie ''[[The Cell]]'', which centers on a [[serial killer]] who bleaches his victims' bodies so they resemble dolls.

The 1987 romantic comedy film [[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]] is about a man who has a relationship with a animated mannequin, which he had found at a department store.

The term '''anthroposystem''' is used to describe the anthropological analogue to the [[ecosystem]]. In other words, the anthroposystem model serves to compare the flow of materials through human systems to those in naturally occurring systems.  As defined by Santos, an anthroposystem is "the orderly combination or arrangement of physical and biological [[Natural environment|environments]] for the purpose of maintaining human civilization...built by man to sustain his kind."  The anthroposystem is intimately linked to [[Economic system|economic]] and [[ecosystem|ecological]] systems as well.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Husar3.png|300px|thumb]] --&gt;
==Description==
Both the anthroposystem and ecosystem can be divided into three groups: producers, [[heterotroph|consumers]], and [[Recycling|recyclers]]. In the ecosystem, the producers or [[autotroph]]s consist of plants and some [[bacteria]] capable of producing their own food via [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemical synthesis]], the consumers consist of animals that obtain energy from grazing and/or by feeding on other animals and the recyclers consist of [[decomposer]]s such as [[Fungus|fungi]] and bacteria.

In the anthroposystem, the [[Factors of production|producers]] consist of the [[energy]] production through [[fossil fuel]]s, manufacturing with non-fuel [[mineral]]s and growing food; the [[consumer]]s consist of humans and domestic animals and the recyclers consist of the decomposing or recycling activities (i.e. [[Sewage treatment|waste water treatment]], metal and solid waste recycling). &lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Husar2.png|300px|thumb]] --&gt;

The ecosystem is [[sustainability|sustainable]]  whereas the anthroposystem is not. The ecosystem is a [[closed-loop controller|closed loop]] in which nearly everything is recycled whereas the anthroposystem is an [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] where very little is recycled.  In contrast to the ecosystem, the anthroposystem's producers and consumers are significantly more spatially displaced than those in the ecosystem and thus, more energy is required to transfer matter to a producer or recycler. Currently, a large majority of this energy comes from non-renewable fossil fuels.

Additionally, recycling is a naturally occurring component of the ecosystem, and is responsible for much of the [[Natural resource|resources]] used by the system. Under the anthroposystem [[Model (abstract)|model]], however, recycling does not naturally occur. Outside input is relied on for material and energy supplies, and recycling systems that do exist are artificially created. The process of improving the flow of energy, such that waste can be reused as input resources, is known as industrial ecology.

A matrix can be used to describe the anthropological network of producers, consumers and recyclers and the movement of materials between each. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Network.png|400px|thumb]]  --&gt;

However, the matrix model of the anthroposystem - based on a model for the ecosystem - fails in acknowledging the physical redistribution of mobilized matter. In developing the anthroposystem model, there is a trade-off between simplicity and completeness.  A simple representative model can be created involving only producers, consumers, and recyclers, but this is an open, incomplete system.  More components and analogues (such as a matrix that encompasses the producers, consumers and recyclers) can be added to the system to make a more complete model, but the model loses simplicity in the process.  Though the anthroposystem concept is flawed in this manner, it is a very good starting point for analyzing human activities and their effects on the environment.

When viewing the Earth as one large anthroposystem, we are essentially eliminating the uncertainty in material flow. All goods (i.e. fossil fuels) will still exist in the system but in a new form (i.e. pollutants). Therefore, the Laws of [[Law of conservation of matter|Conservation of Matter]] and [[Law of conservation of energy|Conservation of Energy]] can be applied to analyze how material flow will impact the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8054">The '''Asiatic style''' or '''Asianism''' ({{lang-la|genus orationis Asiaticum}}, [[Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 325) refers to an [[Ancient Greek]] [[rhetoric]]al tendency (though not an organized school) that arose in the third century BC, which, although of minimal relevance at the time, briefly became an important point of reference in later debates about Roman oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrecht Hommel, "Asianismus," in ''Lexikon der Antike'', Zurich: Artemis Verlag, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterbottom"&gt;Winterbottom, M. 2012 ‘Asianism and Atticism’ in Hornblower, A., Spwaforth, A. and Eidinow, E. (eds.) Oxford Classical Dictionary (4th ed.) 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Hegesias of Magnesia]] was Asianism's first main representative and was considered its founder. Hegesias "developed and exaggerated stylistic effects harking back to the [[sophist]]s and  the [[Gorgias|Gorgianic]] style."&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity'', trans. W. E. Higgins, Washington, D.C.: CUA Press, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Unlike the more austere, formal and traditional [[Atticism|Attic style]], Asiatic oratory was more bombastic, emotional, and coloured with wordplay.&lt;ref name="Winterbottom"/&gt;

The Asiatic style was distinguished by the use of a prose rhythm, especially the end of clauses (''clausulae'').&lt;ref name="De Oratore"&gt;Cic. Orat. LXIX/230-1&lt;/ref&gt; This worked in much the same way as in [[Latin poetry]], although poetic metres themselves were avoided. An effective rhythm could bring an audience to applaud the rhythm alone,&lt;ref&gt;Cic. Or. 214&lt;/ref&gt; however Cicero criticised Asiatic orators for their overly repetitive endings.&lt;ref name="De Oratore"/&gt;

==Roman perspective before Cicero==
The first known use of the term is in Rome, by Cicero in the mid-first century BC. It came into general and pejorative use for a florid style contrasting with the formal, traditional rhetoric of [[Atticism]], which it was said to have corrupted. The term reflects an association with writers in the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]]. "Asianism had a significant impact on Roman rhetoric, since many of the Greek teachers of rhetoric who came to Rome beginning with the 2d cent. B.C.E. were Asiatic Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;David E. Aune, "Asianism," in ''The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature'', Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; "Mildly Asianic tendencies" have been found in [[Gaius Gracchus]]' oratory, and "more marked" ones in [[Publius Sulpicius Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gian Biagio Conte]], ''Latin Literature: A History'', trans. Sodolow, JHU Press, 1994, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; However we have almost no remnants of oratory that can properly be called Asiatic.&lt;ref name="Winterbottom"/&gt;

Cicero (''Orator ad Brutum'' 325) identifies two distinct modes of the Asiatic style: a more studied and symmetrical style (generally taken to mean "full of Gorgianic figures"&lt;ref name=cuypers/&gt;) employed by [[Timaeus (historian)|the historian Timaeus]] and the orators Menecles and Hierocles of Alabanda, and the rapid flow and ornate diction of [[Aeschines of Miletus]] and Aeschylus of Cnidus. Hegesias' "jerky, short clauses" may be placed in the first class, and [[Antiochus I of Commagene]]'s [[Mount Nemrut]] inscription in the second.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. J. Rose]], ''A Handbook of Greek Literature'', 4th rev. ed., London: Methuen, 1950, p. 363, following the analysis of [[Eduard Norden]]'s ''Die antike Kunstprosa''&lt;/ref&gt; The conflation of the two styles under a single name has been taken to reflect the essentially polemical significance of the term: "The key similarity is that they are both extreme and therefore bad; otherwise they could not be more different."&lt;ref name=cuypers&gt;Martine Cuypers, "Historiography, Rhetoric, and Science: Rethinking a Few Assumptions on Hellenistic Prose," in James J. Clauss and Martine Cuypers (eds.), ''A Companion to Hellenistic Literature'', Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, pp. 328f.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, [[Quintus Hortensius]] combined these traditions and made them at home in Latin oratory.

Cicero himself, rejecting the extreme plainness and purism of the Atticists, was attacked by critics such as [[Licinius Macer Calvus]] for being on the side of the ''Asiani''; in response he declared his position as the "Roman [[Demosthenes]]" (noting that the preeminent [[Attic orator]] would not have qualified as Attic by the strict standards of the ''oratores Attici'' of first-century Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Cicero: Philippics 3-9'', vol. 2, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2007, pp. 129f.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, although Cicero identified with an Attic orator, he never went so far as to completely criticise Asiatic oratory,&lt;ref&gt;Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, U. v. 1900 ‘Asianismus und Atticismus’ Hermes 1-52, 3&lt;/ref&gt; and professed a mixed or middle style (''genus medium''; Quintilian 12.10.18: ''genus Rhodium...velut medium...atque ex utroque mixtum'') between the low or plain Attic style and the high Asiatic style, called the '''Rhodian style''' by association with [[Molo of Rhodes]] and [[Apollonius the Effeminate]] (''Rhodii'', Cicero, ''Brutus'' xiii 51).

==Roman perspective after Cicero==
In the [[Nero]]nian period, the surviving portion of [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]'' begins midway through a rant in which the unreliable narrator, Encolpius, denounces the corruption of Roman literary taste and the Asiatic style in particular: "that flatulent, inflated magniloquence later imported from Asia to Athens has infected every aspiring writer like a pestilential breeze" (trans. Branham and Kinney). [[Quintilian]] accepted Cicero's attitude towards Asianism and Atticism,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Maximilian Antony Grube|G. M. A. Grube]], ''The Greek and Roman Critics'', 1968, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted the earlier debate's polemical language, in which objectionable style is called effeminate, in his own ''De causis corruptae eloquentiae''.&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Brink, "Quintilian's ''De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae'' and Tacitus' ''Dialogus de Oratoribus''," ''Classical Quarterly'' 39:2 (1989), pp. 472-503, at p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''Institutio Oratoria'' (XII.10), Quintilian diagnoses the roots of the two styles in terms of ethnic dispositions: "The Attici, refined and discriminating, tolerated nothing empty or gushing; but the Asiatic race somehow more swollen and boastful was inflated with a more vainglory of speaking" (trans. Amy Richlin).&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Gender and Rhetoric: Producing Manhood in the Schools," in William J. Dominik (ed.), ''Roman Eloquence'', Routledge, 1997, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] continued to profess the mixed style. The debate remained topical for [[Tacitus]] (as seen in Pliny's correspondence with him on oratorical styles in Letter [http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/authorsps/a/Letters-Of-Pliny-The-Younger-Letters-20-24-Of-Book-I.htm 1.20]) and contributes to the atmosphere of his ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''.

Ultimately, there seems to have been a general preponderance or victory of the Asiatic over the Attic style in the imperial period.&lt;ref name="Winterbottom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, J. G. F. 2012 ‘Latin Prose-Rhythm’, in Hornblower, A., Spwaforth, A. and Eidinow, E. (eds.) Oxford Classical Dictionary (4th ed.) 1224&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], '''''Barakah''''' or '''''Baraka''''' ({{lang-ar|بركة}}) is a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1216 |title=Home - Brill Reference |publisher=Brillonline.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|title=Sufi Essays|date=1972|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0873952332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Baraka can be found within physical objects, places, and people, as chosen by God. This force begins by flowing directly from God into creation that is worthy of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; These creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of God through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. God is the sole source of baraka and has the power to grant and withhold baraka.

==Islamic mysticism==
Baraka is a prominent concept in Islamic mysticism, particularly [[Sufism]]. It pervades Sufi texts, beliefs, practices, and spirituality. Sufism emphasizes the importance of esoteric knowledge and the spiritual union with God through the heart. Baraka symbolizes this connection between the divine and the worldly through God's direct and intentional blessing of those that are most reflective of Him and his teachings.

Baraka is not a state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It flows from God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have received baraka are thought to have the abilities to perform miracles (''karamat''), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|title=The Shambhala Guide to Sufism|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=9781570621802|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} However, according to [[Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri]], a prominent Sufi mystic, the use of these miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Sources, transmission, and traditional importance==

===Sources===
The [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], saints, prophets, Muhammad and his descendants are all powerful sources of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; Through these sources, one may achieve baraka by three methods: (1) visitation of saints and holy shrines charged with baraka, (2) attachment to the chain of spiritual masters through the [[khirqa]], and (3) emulation of the inner [[Sunnah]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through saints===
Saints as the source of baraka, can transmit baraka to ordinary men simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, "By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors".&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Valerie J.|title=Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt|date=2009|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=157003849X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} In this way, the saints provide a means for ordinary men to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as [[ziyara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamustafa|first1=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520252691}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through khirqa===
Sufis pass esoteric knowledge and baraka from the master [[sheikh]] to the aspirant through the passing of the [[khirqa]]. The khirqa is the initiatory cloak of the Sufi chain of spirituality. This cloak initiates an aspirant into the [[silsilah]], which is the chain of sheikhs that goes back to Muhammad. This chain serves as the channel through which baraka flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of baraka through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk. Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of baraka to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he has sworn. Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the "frock of blessing", is characterized by the passing of baraka to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he has encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|date=2013|publisher=Mizan|location=Jakarta Selatan|isbn=9794337978|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

The silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many hadiths is known as the [[isnad]]. It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that the Sufi tradition began accepting this form of [[isnad]] as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan A.C.|title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=1851686630|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission through Sunnah===
By following the practices and teachings of Muhammad, one can achieve baraka through the emulation of [[Sunnah]]. Because Muhammad is the source of Muhammadan baraka, by living in constant remembrance of [[Names of God in Islam|the names of God]] and in accordance to Muhammad's Sunnah. Those that live the inner Sunnah within the heart, are those that reflect the Light of Muhammad (al-nur al-muhammadi) and the Muhammadan baraka.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Those that live according to the Sunnah, live in constant remembrance of God, and live authentically from the heart are those to whom God opens the channel through which baraka can flow. By living in accordance to Muhammad, one can become worthy of God's direct blessing of baraka. If granted baraka, the saintly person is able to feel God's force from within and is nourished by the hadith while being guided by the baraka.&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Controversy of seeking baraka==
Seeking baraka has been a source of controversy throughout the Islamic world. Through the act of [[ziyara]], saints and the shrines of saints are seen as a means to access the baraka sent from God.  Because of this, many within Islam see ziyara as a form of [[idolatry]] in the way devotees may look towards the saints instead of towards God, Himself, for baraka.&lt;ref name="Sells"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seels|first1=Michael A.|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'raj, Poetic and Theological Writings|date=1996|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809136198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Although ziyara has been a source of great controversy, it remains one of the most typical ritual practices of Islamic spirituality.&lt;ref name="Sells"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, personnel selection has relied on standardized psychological tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reilly, R. R. |author2= Chao, G.

The mean validity of interviews was found to be 0.19. research has indicated a validity coefficient of 0.29 for unstructured interviews and 0.31 for structured interviews but interview results can be affected by interviewer biases and have been challenged in a number of different court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harris, M.

In summary, biodata has been shown to be a valid and reliable means to predict future performance based on an applicant’s past performance.  A well-constructed biodata instrument is legally defendable and unlike the interview, is not susceptible to error due to rater biases or the halo effect.  It has proven its worth in personnel selection as a cost effective tool.&lt;ref&gt;Kuschnereit, F. and Spinner, B. (June 1997).  "Improving The Accuracy of Biodata Questionnaires".  Paper presented at the 58th Annual Convention of the Canadian Psychological Association, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[South Asian]] community ([[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]]), a biodata is essentially a [[Resume|résumé]]. The purpose is similar to that of a résumé, to eliminate some candidates from the pool of prospective suitors before meeting others.  The biodata generally contains the same type of information as a résumé (i.e. objective, work history, salary information, educational background), but may also include physical attributes, such as height, weight, hair/skin/eye color, and a photo.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Book of Nepos''''' is a lost 3rd century Christian text written by an [[Christianity in Egypt|Egyptian]] bishop Nepos,&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 1.&lt;/ref&gt; which advocated for a strictly [[Hermeneutics#Literal|literal]] [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation of the Bible]] against [[Hermeneutics#Allegorical|allegorical]] readings. This included especially a literal reading of the [[Book of Revelation]], a minority position at the time.

== Extant portions ==
The ''Book of Nepos'' no longer exists, and is known only indirectly through [[Eusebius]], who quoted a work by [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] criticizing Nepos.&lt;ref name="RobinsonRobinson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas A. Robinson|author2=Thomas Arthur Robinson|title=Who Were the First Christians?: Dismantling the Urban Thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-g41DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=1 December 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-062054-7|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/nepos-arsinoe Nepos of Arsinoë], New Catholic Encyclopedia, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology and reception ==
Nepos was a strict literalist (believing the entire [[Bible]] is true in a literal sense), and his text, also known as the '''Refutation of the Allegorisers''' or '''Refutation of the Allegorists''' was aimed at refuting the arguments of those who held that certain sections of the Bible were mere [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]]' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the text is aimed at discrediting the position, held by a minority of Christians at the time, that the [[book of Revelation]] should be interpreted allegorically rather than literally.

Amongst the teachings in the text is the belief that [[Jesus]] would come to earth and physically reign as monarch for 1000 years during an age of righteous delight. This belief was regarded as fairly orthodox in the early church (e.g. it was held by [[Irenaeus]], and [[Justin Martyr]]), however, the later church came to view Revelation as more allegorical. Indeed, Dionysius of Alexandria felt moved to write a text (''On the Promises'') against it, although he regarded Nepos highly and attempted to criticize the doctrine without insulting Nepos personally.

The ''Book of Nepos'' was so popular within the villages around Alexandria that Dionysius went there in person to refute it.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In deference to Nepos and the prior orthodoxy of strict literalism, he did so politely, entering a respectful dialogue with those from the village and contesting each of the arguments they took from the ''Book of Nepos'' in turn.

The '''Center for Intercultural Dialogue''' ('''CID''') was established by the [[Council of Communication Associations]] (CCA) in March 2010.&lt;ref name="CCA March 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Communication Associations Minutes for March 2010|url=https://communicationassociations.wordpress.com/history/minutes/march-2010/|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W.

Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intercultural dialogue occurs when members of different cultural groups, who hold conflicting opinions and assumptions, speak to one another in acknowledgment of those differences. As such, it forms "the heart of what we study when we study intercultural communication."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, B. K., et al. (2014). Our role as intercultural scholars, practitioners, activists, and teachers in addressing these key intercultural urgencies, issues, and challenges.

The CID is creating an international network, including both scholars and practitioners.&lt;ref name="Witteborn 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Witteborn|first=Saskia|title=The Center for Intercultural Dialogue: Creating scholarly community, merging theory and practice|work=Paper presented at the International Communication Association Annual Convention, 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CID broadly represents scholars in the discipline of Communication, but has a specific mandate to directly serve those who are members of any member associations of CCA. As of 2016, these include:

* [[American Journalism Historians Association]]
* [[Association for business communication|Association for Business Communication]]
* Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication
* Black College Communication Association
* [[Broadcast Education Association]]
* [[International Communication Association]]
* National Association for Media Literacy Education

When CID was founded in 2010, two other associations were members: 
* [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]
* [[National Communication Association]]

The Summer Conference resulted in a preconference at the [[International Communication Association]] convention in [[Singapore]] in 2010, organized by Evelyn Ho.&lt;ref name="Ho 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ho|first=Evelyn|title=Preconference on Intercultural Dialogue: In Singapore or From Your Own Home..|journal=ICA Newsletter|date=June 2010|volume=38|issue=5|url=http://www.icahdq.org/members/MembersNewsletter/JUN10_HOPRECONFERENCE.asp|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first publication resulting from the presentations appeared in 2011, in a special issue of the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication'', edited by Prue Holmes and Shiv Ganesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=S|author2=Holmes, P.|title=Culture, communication, and peacebuilding: A reflexive  multi-dimensional contextual framework|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|year=2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=245–269|doi=10.1080/17513057.2012.716858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An edited collection resulting from the Istanbul conference appeared in 2015, edited by Haydari and Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;Haydari, N., &amp; Holmes, P.

Participants at the Summer Conference wanted a way to encourage further international connections for intercultural research, and so a proposal was brought before the Council of Communication Associations' Board of Directors at their March 2010 meeting to create the Center for Intercultural Dialogue, which was approved.&lt;ref name="CCA March 2010" /&gt; Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz was appointed Director of CID at that same meeting. The first Advisory Board was approved at the September 2010 meeting, and included: Donal Carbaugh, William Evans, Nazan Haydari, Barbara Hines, Janice Hume, Leena Louhiala-Salminen, Charles Self, Michael Slater, Katerina Sténou and Valerie White.&lt;ref name="CCA September 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of Communication Associations Minutes for September 2010|url=https://communicationassociations.wordpress.com/history/minutes/september-2010/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New members of the Board were appointed in 2014. Together Board members represent all of the CCA member associations (through overlapping memberships), as well as the applied context of international non-profits. The CID website now serves as a clearinghouse for information on intercultural dialogue topics, and facilitates connections between international scholars by sharing information on publication opportunities, international conferences and positions, graduate school programs, and researcher profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2015). Intercultural dialogue. In K. Tracy, C. Ilie &amp; T. Sandel (Eds.), ''International encyclopedia of language and social interaction'' (vol. 2, pp. 860-868). Boston: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the CID and the [http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/communication/wfi.html Waterhouse Family Institute], housed within [[Villanova University]]’s Department of Communication in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2013/12/17/cid-agreement-with-waterhouse-family-institute/&lt;/ref&gt; The two organizations intend to cooperate on, and seek joint grant funding for, several projects over the next few years. In March 2014, the CID co-sponsored a conference with the University of Macau, entitled "Roundtable on Intercultural Dialogue in Asia."&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2014/04/09/roundtable-on-intercultural-dialogue-in-asia-macau/&lt;/ref&gt; A videotape briefly summarizing that event was prepared, and published online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-wGFSJZHQ&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialogue generally, and intercultural dialogue specifically, have been discussed at multiple conferences, and served as the topic of consideration by many organizations over the past few years, becoming a key term and a "preferred form for human action," and Carbaugh specifically lists this CID as one such effort.&lt;ref name="Carbaugh 2013"/&gt;  Several other organizations have either the same or a similar name. The CID described in this entry is the only one designed to serve the Communication discipline specifically, and to facilitate the study of intercultural dialogue as a research topic by creating an international network of scholars.&lt;ref name="Witteborn 2012" /&gt;  It is for this reason that the CID's slogan is "Bridging Cultures Through Research."

==Publications==
CID began publishing ''Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue'', a set of one page descriptions of technical vocabulary related to intercultural dialogue in various ways, in February 2014.&lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/&lt;/ref&gt; The first few terms were: intercultural dialogue, cosmopolitanism, intercultural competence, coordinated management of meaning, intercultural communication, intercultural capital, and intergroup relations dialogue.&lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"/&gt; As of November 2014, terms in languages other than English were added, including yuan (Chinese), conscientização (Portuguese), uchi-soto (Japanese), testimonio (Spanish), and interkulturelle Philosophie (German), among others. As of June 2016, concepts were added in translation into a wide range of languages, including Arabic, Belarusian, Chinese, German, Indonesian, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. 

CID began publishing a second series in February 2017, ''Constructing Intercultural Dialogues'' describing specific case studies of times people managed to engage in intercultural dialogues. These are also being translated, with the first one in Italian published in April 2017. &lt;ref name="centerforinterculturaldialogue.org"&gt;http://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/&lt;/ref&gt; A third series, ''CID Posters'', turning verbal concepts into visual images, was introduced in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/publications/cid-posters/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
Since the CID grew out of the NCA Summer Conference on Intercultural Dialogue, all concerned parties agreed to continued use of the logo [[:File:Center for Intercultural Dialogue logo.jpg]] designed for that event by Özer Karakuş of [[Maltepe University]]. The multiple colors bound together represent cultural diversity and the need for intercultural dialogue. The bridge represents the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] in [[Istanbul]], connecting Europe to Asia.

==Social Media==
Due to the efforts of Minh Cao, then Assistant to the Director of the CID, a social media presence was established by 2014, and by 2016 there were thousands of followers in one platform or another.&lt;ref&gt;https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/2014/01/01/cid-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a YouTube channel,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/IntercultDialogue&lt;/ref&gt; a Facebook group,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Center.for.Intercultural.Dialogue.DC&lt;/ref&gt; a LinkedIn group,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6533775&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/IntercultDialog&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Climate Change and Emissions Management Amendment Act''' of the Canadian province of [[Alberta]] was the first law of its type to impose greenhouse gas cuts on large industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01855.html|title=Climate Change|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June 27, 2007 Alberta first in North America to impose greenhouse gas cuts on large industrial facilities - Multi-sector emission cuts come into effect July 1 [http://www.gov.ab.ca/acn/200706/217306EC104D7-0191-EE88-DC294E2D925234E5.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from  July 1, 2007, [[Alberta]] facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of [[greenhouse gases]] per year will be required to reduce their emissions intensity by 12 percent under the Climate Change and Emissions Management Amendment Act.

Companies have three ways to meet their reductions: they can make operating improvements, buy an Alberta-based credit, or contribute to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund.

The regulations apply to about 100 large facilities which emit more than 100,000 tonnes of [[greenhouse gases]] a year. Those facilities account for about 70 per cent of Alberta's industrial greenhouse gas emissions.

The annual cost of compliance is estimated to be $177 million - or less than one tenth of one per cent of Alberta's nominal GDP ($242 billion in 2006).

==Alberta-based credits==
A facility can purchase credits from large emitters that have reduced their emissions intensity beyond their 12 percent target. They can also purchase credits from facilities whose emissions are below the 100,000-tonne threshold but are voluntarily reducing their emissions. 
The projects must have legitimate greenhouse gas reductions in the province.

==Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund==
A third option would be for companies to pay $15 for every tonne over their reduction target. The money will be put into the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund, which will be directed to strategic projects or transformative technology aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the province.

According to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Amendment Act, funds may be used only for purposes related to reducing emissions of specified gases or improving Alberta's ability to adapt to climate change; including without limitation, the following purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/sa-2003-c-c-16.7/latest/sa-2003-c-c-16.7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200358/http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/sa-2003-c-c-16.7/latest/sa-2003-c-c-16.7.html |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* energy conservation and energy efficiency;
* demonstration and use of new technologies that emphasize reductions in specified gas emissions in the discovery, recovery, processing, * transportation and use of Alberta's energy resources;
* demonstration and use of new technologies that emphasize reductions in specified gas emissions through the use of alternative energy and renewable energy sources;
* demonstration and use of specified gas capture, use and storage technology;
* development of opportunities for removal of specified gases from the atmosphere through sequestration by sinks;
* measurement of the natural removal and storage of carbon;
* climate change adaptation programs and measures;
* paying salaries, fees, expenses, liabilities or other costs incurred by a delegated authority in carrying out a duty or function of or exercising a power of the Minister in respect of the Fund that has been delegated to the delegated authority, if authorized by the regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3954">==List of comedic devices==

===Repetition===
Repetition is the essential comedic device and is often used in combination with other devices to reinforce them. The [[Callback (comedy)|"callback"]] in comedy writing—in which a statement or theme is recalled as the punchline or close of a scene—is a classic example of the tension and release that are possible using repetition. It is also the basis for "Englishman, Irishman, and Scotsman" jokes, where repetition is used to set up a modus operandi and build tension before the Irishman (usually assumed to be the stupid one) provides the resolving juxtaposition.

===Hyperbole, or Overstatement===
{{Main article|Hyperbole}}
Hyperbole, an overstatement, is a figure of speech in which statements are exaggerated or extravagant. It may be used to reflect or affect strong feelings or a strong impression.

===Understatement===
{{Main article|Understatement}}
An understatement is a figure of speech in which statements are purposely understated. It may be used to indicate the speaker's nonchalance (or obliviousness) regarding an often important or otherwise remarkable situation. It often results in irony where, for instance,  the speaker's response to an event does not match how the viewer expects the speaker to react.

===Double entendre===
{{Main article|Double entendre}}
A '''double entendre''' is a spoken [[phrase]] that can be understood in either of two ways.  The first, literal meaning is an innocent one, while the second, figurative meaning is often [[irony|ironic]] or risqué and requires the hearer to have some additional knowledge to understand the joke.

===Pun===
{{Main article|Pun}}
A '''pun''' consists of a deliberate confusion of similar [[word]]s or [[phrase]]s for humorous effect, whether humorous or serious. A pun can rely on the assumed equivalency of multiple similar words ([[homonym]]y), of different shades of meaning of one word ([[polysemy]]), or of a literal meaning with a [[metaphor]].

===Juxtaposition===
Juxtaposition is a literary technique which causes the audience to compare two elements simply because they are placed next to each other.  When the comparison is unexpected, it creates [[irony]].  In some cases, this can be created through grammatical ambiguity.  For example, success and failure.

===Mistaken identity===
The mistaken identity (often of one twin for another) is a centuries-old comedic device used by Shakespeare in several of his works. The mistake can be either an intended act of deception or an accident.  Modern examples include ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'', ''[[The Truth About Cats and Dogs]]', ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''', ''and the films of'' [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]]''.

===Taboo===
{{Main article|Taboo}}
There is a liberating element to saying something that nobody else would say in a civilized environment.  Being disgusting or politically wrong in front of an audience can surprise and shock an audience (i.e. jokes about pedophiles).

===Slapstick=== 
{{Main article|Slapstick}}
Slapstick is a type of comedy involving exaggerated physical violence. Slapstick was heavily used by [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Keystone Kops]], [[the Three Stooges]]. Slapstick is also common in animated [[cartoon]]s such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">The '''continuum concept''' is an idea, coined by [[Jean Liedloff]] in her 1975 book '''''The Continuum Concept''''', that [[human being]]s have an [[innate]] set of expectations (which Liedloff calls the '''continuum''') that our evolution as a species has designed us to meet in order to achieve optimal physical, mental, and emotional [[Human development (biology)|development and adaptability]]. According to Liedloff, in order to achieve this level of development, young humans—especially babies—require the kind of experience to which our species adapted during the long process of [[human evolution|our evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. For infants, these include, for example, that they experience:

*Immediate placement, after birth, in their mothers' arms: Liedloff comments that the common hospital protocol of immediately separating a newborn from its mother may hormonally disrupt the mother, possibly explaining high rates of [[postpartum depression]];
*Constant carrying or physical contact with other people (usually their mothers or fathers) in the several months after birth, as these adults go about their day-to-day business (during which the infants observe and thus learn, but also nurse, or sleep); this forms a strong basis of personal security for infants, according to Liedloff, from which they will begin developing a healthy drive for independent exploration by eventually starting to naturally creep, and then crawl, usually at six to eight months; She calls this the "In-Arms" phase.
* Sleeping in the parents' bed (called [[co-sleeping]]), in constant physical contact, until leaving of their own volition (often about two years); 
* [[Breastfeeding]] "on cue"&amp;mdash;involving infants' bodily signals being immediately answered by their mothers' nursing them; 
* Caregivers' immediate response to the infants' urgent body signals (flaring temper, crying, sniffling, etc.), without judgment, displeasure, or invalidation of the children's needs, but also not showing any undue concern or focusing on or overindulging the children; 
* Sensing (and fulfilling) elders' expectations that the infants are innately social and cooperative and have strong self-preservation instincts, and that they are welcome and worthy (yet without making them the constant center of attention)

[[File:Namibian woman with her baby on her back.jpg|thumb|Namibian woman with her baby on her back]]

Liedloff suggests that when certain evolutionary expectations are not met as infants and toddlers, compensation for these needs will be sought, by alternate means, throughout life—resulting in many forms of mental and social disorders. She also argues that these expectations are largely distorted, neglected, and/or not properly met in civilized cultures which have removed themselves from the natural evolutionary process, resulting in the aforementioned abnormal psychological and social conditions. Liedloff's recommendations fit in more generally with [[evolutionary psychology]], [[attachment theory]], and the philosophy known as the [[Paleolithic lifestyle]]: optimizing well-being by living more like our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors, who Liedloff refers to as "evolved" humans, since their lifeways developed through natural selection by living in the wild.

==References in popular culture==

* In the comedy movie ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' (2004) [[Barbra Streisand]]'s character, a free-spirited [[Liberalism|liberal]], mentions the continuum concept in jest during an argument with a [[Ferber method]]-favoring character ([[Robert De Niro]]).
* The continuum concept featured on television in the UK in the 2007 [[Channel 4]] series ''[http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/B/bringing_up_baby/ Bringing Up Baby]''. It was chosen{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} as one of three influential parenting "methods" of the 20th century which various new parents 'tested out'.
* In the film ''[[Away We Go]]'' (2009), the couple of LN and Roderick (portrayed by [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] and [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]) describe their household as following "continuum" practices.

'''Dematerialization of the art object''' is an idea in [[conceptual art]].  In "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [[Lucy Lippard]] characterizes the period of 1966 to 1972 as one in which the [[art object]] was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Blocker]] ''What the Body Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ekphonetic notation''' consists of symbols added to certain sacred texts, especially [[lectionary]] readings of Biblical texts, as a [[mnemonic]] device to assist in their [[cantillation]].  Ekphonetic notation can take a number of forms, and has been used in several [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] [[plainchant]] traditions, but is most commonly associated with [[Byzantine chant]].  In many cases, the original meaning of ekphonetic [[neume]]s is obscure, and must be reconstructed by comparison with later notation.

'''Fur massage''' is a form of touch that is used in partner massage. It involves using a fur glove to touch one's partner in an attempt to arouse.&lt;ref name="my-other-self" /&gt; In therapeutic usage, [[professional boundaries]] do not permit that the therapist (giver) be emotionally involved in a massage.&lt;ref name="mosby" /&gt; Fur massage mitts are sometimes recommended by professionals as a sensual toy rather than sexual toy.&lt;ref name="toys" /&gt; Use of fur gloves for massage is considered a ''[[safe sex]]'' practice by the [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]].&lt;ref name="safer-sex" /&gt;

Couples employ [[fur]] [[massage]] to focus their attention on the importance of [[touch]] and to sensitize specific areas of the [[skin]].&lt;ref name="lip-service" /&gt; Couples use fur massage to stimulate the [[lymphatic system]] by exciting the skin. While traditional massage requires strong tissue rubs and technical expertise, fur massage stirs the imagination and highlights the [[Eroticism|erotic]] nature of touch. Special mitts are available.&lt;ref name="advanced-techniques" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tantra" /&gt;

'''Gender systems''' are the [[social structures]] that establish the number of genders and their associated [[gender role]]s in every society.  A ''gender role'' is "everything that a person says and does to indicate to others or to the self the degree that one is either male, female, or androgynous. This includes but is not limited to sexual and erotic arousal and response."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Pub., 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}}  [[Gender identity]] is one's own personal experience with gender role and the persistence of one's individuality as male, female, or androgynous, especially in self-awareness and behavior.
[[Gender binary]] is one example of a gender system.  A ''gender binary'' is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.

==Non-European gender systems==
In cultures where the gender binary is prominent and important, [[transgender]] people are a major exception to the societal norms related to gender.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Intersex]] people, those who cannot be biologically determined as either male or female, are another obvious deviation. Other cultures have their own practices independent of the Western gender binary.

===Native American===
When European settlers first arrived in North America, they discovered different Native American tribes had different concepts of sex and gender. In the Native North American society "[[two-spirit|berdaches]]" were given that name to identify them as gender variants. The Europeans "attempted to explain the berdache from various functional perspectives...in terms of the contributions these sex/gender roles made to social structure or culture."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999&gt;Nanda, Serena. Gender Diversity: Crosscultural Variations. Waveland Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  The term "berdache" was deemed inappropriate and insulting as time passed and awareness increased, so a new term was coined in 1990, "[[Two-Spirit]]."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|13}} There were many roles for male and female [[Two-Spirits]], productive specialization, supernatural sanction and gender variation. Some widespread features of the variety of gender roles are: transvestism, cross-gender occupation, same sex (but different gender) sexuality, recruitment to different roles, special languages, ritual roles, and associations with spiritual power.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|14}}  [[Cross-dressing]] was the most visible marker but has proven a variable and less reliable indicator of status as a [[Two-Spirit]]. However the main interest is that these people are an accepted portion of their society. In some cases they were even given special respect and various honors. 
The roles varied greatly between tribes.  For example, a male variant might have to wear male clothing during warfare, but women’s clothing any other time.  These [[gender role]]s were often decided at a young age.  If a boy was interested in women’s activities, or vice versa, a gender variant role would likely be undertaken in adulthood.  "In some societies, same-sex sexual desire or practice did figure into the definition of one’s gender variant role, in others, it did not."&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|19}}
In the case of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], there were four genders: man, woman, masculine female-bodied [[nádleeh]], and feminine male-bodied nádleeh.  Intercourse between two people of different genders, regardless of biological sex, was not stigmatized.  However, any sexual relationship between two of the same one gender was considered homosexual, and was strongly disapproved of.  In the majority of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies however, biological sex played no part in any gender variant role.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|13}}

====The Mohave Alyha====
In [[Mohave people|Mohave]] society, pregnant women believed they had dreams [[forecasting]] the anatomic [[sex]] of their children.  These dreams also sometimes included hints of their child’s future [[gender variance|gender variant]] status.  
A boy who "acted strangely" before he participated in the boy’s puberty ceremonies in the Mohave tribe would be considered for the transvestite ceremony.  Expressing interest in dolls, the domestic work of women, women’s gambling games, and inquiring about the female skirt were all ways a boy may be considered for the transvestite ceremony.  Before the ceremony, relatives would try to dissuade him, but if the boy persists, they would assist in the preparations for the ceremony.
The ceremony itself was meant to surprise the boy.  It was a test of willingness.  Other nearby settlements would receive word to come and watch.  A circle of onlookers would sing special songs.  If the boy danced like a woman, it confirmed his status as an ''alyha''.  He was then taken to a river to bathe, and was given a skirt to wear.  The ceremony would permanently change his gender status within the tribe.  He then took up a female name.  The alyha would imitate many aspects of female life, including [[menstruation]], [[puberty|puberty observations]], pregnancy, and birth.  The alyha were considered great healers, especially in curing [[sexually transmitted disease]]s like [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|21&amp;ndash;23}}

=== Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
A documentary film entitled ''[[Blossoms of Fire]]'', produced in 2000, depicts the people of [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca, Mexico]]. It follows the daily lives of the women as they run their businesses, wear colorfully bold traditional clothing and hold their heads firmly high as they carry the weight on top. The film clearly depicts the empowered women and the tolerance of [[homosexuality]] and [[transgender]] individuals. The community exemplifies an alternative gender system unlike the [[gender binary]] that has been established throughout the world. On many occasions this community has been criticized and labeled as a [[matriarchy]]; however, the individuals who are interviewed throughout the film tend to say otherwise. They strongly believe that their community is able to function because [[gender roles]] are not placed on individuals but rather that everyone is equal—for example there is no identifiable "bread winner". Children are taken care of by whoever can help; food is cooked by anyone who is able to and drinking beer and smoking is not only okay for the "men" of the community. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[transgender]] people tend to feel more accepted in this alternative gender system. [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán's]] society operates under a more egalitarian gender system in which men and women have different, but not exclusive roles, and in which these roles are not necessarily expected. Due to liberal gender performance, [[third gender]]s also have more prominence in [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán]] than other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Blossoms of Fire''. Lydia Nibley.

=== Machi (Mapuche Shamans) of Chile ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
The [[machi (shaman)|machi]] are the shamans of the [[Mapuche]] people of [[Chile]], and are viewed to a large extent by both [[Mapuche]] and the Chilean state as keepers of Mapuche political, cultural, and spiritual tradition and power. In many ways the [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] represent an alternative gender system in that homosexual acts are more accepted, gender switching occurs, and the practice of [[polygamy]] took place.&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003&gt;Bacigalupo, Ana Mariella. "Mapuche Shamanic Bodies and the Chilean State: Polemic Gendered Representation and Indigenous Responses".'' Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State''. Ed. A.J. Aldama. Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University Press. 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322-343}} However, though it appears there is more gender freedom, gender switching occurs based on different shamanic practices performed, and the gender associated with the practice is either derived from physical sex based on reproduction etc. or from the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] gender system of the nation of [[Chile]]. For example, political participation has become a masculine practice, while spiritual practices are considered feminine. While one does not have to be a physical "male" or "female" necessarily to perform these practices, they must channel that gender to perform them.

The [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] were inevitably influenced by the dominant western gender system of [[Chile]] through state sponsored evangelization, (most [[Mapuche]] today are [[Catholic]])&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003 /&gt;{{rp|327&amp;ndash;328}} and by the [[Indigenous peoples in Chile#The Indigenous Law|Indigenous Law]]. [[Indigenous peoples in Chile#The Indigenous Law|The Indigenous Law]] further politicized the machi and further subjected them in national discourse to the gender norms of the Chilean state, changing the way that [[Machi (shaman)|machi]] perform gender. "Machi juggle various gendered systems of knowledge and identities according to their intentions, who is present, and in what context"&lt;ref name=Bacigalupo-2003 /&gt;{{rp|334}}

===Indian Hindu===
In [[Hindu]] [[India]], there also exists different concepts of what is socially accepted when gender is in question.  When compared to the native North Americans, the gender system is essentially binary, but the ideas themselves are quite different from Western thoughts.  These ideas often come from religious contexts.  Some Hindu origin myths feature [[androgynous]] or hermaphroditic ancestors.  Ancient poets often showed this idea by presenting images with mixed physical attributes between the two sexes.  These themes still exist in the culture, and are even still institutionalized.  The most prominent group are the hijras.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|27,28}}

====Hijras====
{{main article|Hijra (South Asia)}}
[[File:Hijra.jpg|thumb|A Hijra from India.]]
{{one source|section|date=June 2011}}
"The recognition of more than two sex/genders is recorded in India as early as the eighth century BCE".&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|29}} In modern [[India]], the term [[hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is most commonly meant as "eunuch" or intersexed, and is a term of sexual impotence.  In the culture’s definition, a hijra is one born as a male, but adopts the clothing, behavior, and occupations of women. Their status in society is neither male nor female, neither man nor woman. When hijras are asked whether or not they are male or female, most often they respond with comments like "We hijras are like women",&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|xxiii}} demonstrating their place in culture.  Hijras walk, gesture, speak, and use facial expressions more common to women in India.  They even take feminine names as part of their gender transformation. Becoming a Hijra however is not outside of Indian society. Being a hijra means making a commitment that gives social support and some economic security, as well as a cultural meaning, linking them to the larger world.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|54}}

"A male who is not born biologically intersexed who wishes to become a hijra must transform his sex/gender through an emasculation operation".&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|29}}  This operation is a rebirth for the hijras, and contains elements of childbirth to symbolize this.  The process includes [[castration]], [[bloodletting]], and special rituals.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|33}}  Among the hijra society there is a hierarchy of gurus, or teachers, and chelas, or disciples.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1990 /&gt;{{rp|42}} In order for one to be accepted into the hijra society they must be sponsored by a guru, who in turn teaches them and helps them form a family.

As of November 11, 2013, the country of [[Bangladesh]] has decided to begin a third gender birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh’s Hijras Win Official Recognition as Separate Gender |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/13/bangladeshs-hijras-win-official-recognition-as-separate-gender/ |work=online article |publisher=Global Voices |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609012908/http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/11/13/bangladeshs-hijras-win-official-recognition-as-separate-gender/ |archivedate=June 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sādhin====
The sādhin are similar to [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]] culturally.  Their development is quite different however, and their existence is much less prominent.  It is a girl’s choice to become a sādhin.  They wear men’s clothing and keep their hair short.  They commonly keep their female name and are still treated as a female in society, although the status of sādhin, like hijra, transcends the gender labels of India.  A sādhin candidate must be a virgin, and swear to celibacy.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|40,41}}

===[[Naples]] and [[Southern Italy]]===
{{main article|Femminiello}}
''[[Femminielli]]'' or ''femmenielli'' (singular ''femminiello'', cf. [[Standard Italian]] ''femmina'', "a female", ''-ello'', masculine [[diminutive]] suffix) is a term used to refer to a population of males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional [[Naples|Neapolitan]] culture.&lt;ref name="Corriere"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulvio |first1=Bufi |year=2009 |title=Presa Ketty, boss "femminiello" Comandava i pusher di Gomorra |journal=Corriere della Sera |issue=February 13, 2009 |pages=19 |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/febbraio/13/Presa_Ketty_boss_femminiello_Comandava_co_8_090213017.shtml |accessdate= |quote=FEMMINIELLO E' UNA FIGURA OMOSESSUALE (..)

It is often considered reductive to insert the Neapolitan ''femminiello'' within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo-Saxon and North American contexts. The ''femminiello'', instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon confer to the ''femminiello'' a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the ''femminiello'' is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochdorn, Alexander, Paolo F. Cottone and Dania Vallini (2011). Gender and discursive positioning: Doing transgender in highly normative contexts. ''69th Conference of the International Council of Psychologists''. 29 July - 2 August 2011, Washington DC (USA) http://www.icpweb.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304231821/http://icpweb.org/ |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polynesia===
In [[Polynesia]] there are many different terms for [[gender role]]s, for example in [[Tahiti]] the role is called [[mahu (person)|māhū]]. In [[Samoa]] the male gender variant is called [[fa’afafine]] which means "like a woman." Tuva and Tonga have terms also.  In Tonga the term is fakaleiti and in Tuva the term is pinapinnaine. All of these terms are used when a male engages in women's work, clothes, speech tones, and nonverbal gestures. However, in [[Polynesia]] when a man crosses genders and "acts like a woman" he is not viewed as becoming a woman, but is suspended between male and female, being neither at the same time, but having the elements of both.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|57&amp;ndash;70}}  They tend to be effeminate and interested in women’s household tasks, but do not dress exclusively as women.  They often seek oral sex with men, who may ridicule them in public, but seek them out for pleasure in private.&lt;ref name=Rupp-2001&gt;Rupp, Leila J. "Toward a Global History of Same-Sex Sexuality." Journal of the History of Sexuality 10.2 (2001): pp. 287-302. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|334}}

===Thailand===
[[Image:Kathoy1649.jpg|thumb|right|Kathoeys on the stage of a cabaret show in Pattaya.]]
[[Kathoey]] is the term used by both males and females that allows them to be alongside the normative masculine and feminine identities. Up until the 1970s [[hermaphrodites]] and cross-dressing men and women could all come under the term kathoey, however the term has been dropped for the cross-dressing masculine females who are now referred to as ''tom''.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|73}} As a result of the shifts, kathoey today is most commonly understood as a male [[transgender]] category. Kathoey is derived from the [[Buddhist]] myth that describes three original human sex/genders, male, female, and a biological hermaphrodite or kathoey.&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|73}} Kathoey is not defined as merely being a variant between male or female but as an independently existing third sex.

===Philippines===
The notable gender variant role in the Philippines is the [[Bakla (Philippines)|bakla]].  Bakla are males with a feminine spirit, or core identity, who cross-dress and are assumed to take the receiving role in sex.  In the Philippines, a "real man" is simply one who is not bakla.  Since there are negative connotations of local terms for gender diversity, many bakla prefer to self-identify as gay, rather than a new gender.  The baklas’ partners are not considered homosexual by Filipino society.  Over time, baklas have tried to gain status as a [[third gender|third sex or gender]] as an attempt to normalize their nonconformity and be equal to males and females in society.&lt;&lt;ref name=Nanda-1999 /&gt;{{rp|78&amp;ndash;84}}

===Nigeria===
Oyewumi observes that among the [[Yoruba people]] there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref name=Lugones-2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|date=Winter 2008|volume= 22|issue= 1|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 May 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196&amp;ndash;198}}

==The cultural definition of homosexuality==
In cultures where the difference between male and female in the gender binary is masculine and feminine, it is important to look at how same-sex sexuality changes between cultures.  In some cultures, like the [[travesti|travestí]], homosexual behavior moves one from one part of a gender binary to another.

Homosexuality, and its effects on the individual’s place in society is sometimes drastically different in various other cultures.  In certain [[Sambia people]] of New Guinea for example, it is believed that a boy is unable to reach [[puberty]] or maturity without first ingesting the [[semen]], considered ''life-force'', of an older male.&lt;ref name=Peoples-2001&gt;Peoples, James G. "The Cultural Construction of Gender and Manhood." Men and Masculinity. 1st Edition ed.Cengage Learning, 2001. Print&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9&amp;ndash;18}}  In addition, these Sambian people believe that a man is unable to replenish his semen on his own, so the ritual continues until a certain time, usually marriage, when he is told of a tree that exudes a milky semen-like sap he may ingest instead.&lt;ref name=Peoples-2001 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

In Basotho society in contemporary [[Lesotho]], girls and women may exchange long kisses, engage in [[cunnilingus]], and even fall in love and form a marriage-like union.  In this society however, sex requires penetration, and marriage requires a man as a husband.  Therefore, in this context, there is no concept of lesbianism.&lt;ref name=Rupp-2001 /&gt;{{rp|336}}

==The Alternative Model of Gender==
In "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough", Anne Fausto-Sterling explores the possibilities of the [[intersex]] and how these individuals fit into the traditional labeling of "male" and "female".  Her "Alternative Model of Gender," is a proposition that allows for the inclusion of intersexual individuals into the traditional gender labeling system. Anne Fausto-Sterling proposes that a body does not necessarily have to fit into the orthodox [[gender binary]] set by a society, but rather can be categorized under the possibility of [[male]], [[female]], merm, ferm, and herm, which are labels given to individuals born with a variation in sex characteristics. Fausto-Sterling’s "Of Gender and Genitals" discuses the fate of the individuals born with "ambiguous" genitalia and the need to surgically correct the deviations these individuals propel into a male-female society. 
She explores the need for allowing the body to be labeled as is, rather than configuring it into the expectations of society, as the traditional binary gender labeling calls for. The Alternative Model allows for this type of gender labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough|journal=The Sciences|date=March–April 1993|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-07714-5|pages=44–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gendered violence==
{{POV check|section|date=June 2011}}
Gendered violence is an important worldwide issue that can take place in different forms with varying consequences. It can be similar to a [[hate crime]] in which physical violence is specifically targeting the victim's gender. Transgender people and women experience the most gender violence but anyone can be a victim. Women are particularly at risk of gender violence in intimate relationships. Women are 10 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices Feminist Actions|last=Shaw|first=Susan M.|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act of violence occurs in the public as well as the private domain and can sometimes be overlooked. Countless deaths have resulted from these severe crimes as seen in the film ''[[Two-Spirits|Two Spirits]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Spirits''. Lydia Nibley. Say Yes Quickly Productions, Riding the Tiger Productions, and Just Media, 2010. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations nationwide such as [[California Coalition Against Sexual Assault]] help to support and aid the Latino communities in particular to put an end to domestic violence. It is also a matter related to the dominant gender system, which often underlies the motives for gendered violence. The dominant gender system also creates [[structural violence]].&lt;ref name=Lugones-2011 /&gt;{{rp|188}}

'''Globalism''' refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. The term is used by detractors of [[globalization]] such as [[right-wing populist]] movements. While primarily associated with [[world-system]]s, other things with global reach have also been so described.

Historically, it has been associated with international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and also sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of "[[nation building]]" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1992 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.

== Definitions and interpretations ==
[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines ''globalism'', "at least in its more specific use, ... as the dominant ideology and [[subjectivity]] associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.

Alternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.&lt;ref name="Nye 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x | volume=9 | title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory | journal=International Studies Review | pages=173–196 | last1 = Martell | first1 = Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).

During the election and presidency of United States president [[Donald Trump]], Trump and members of his administration used the term ''globalist'' on multiple occasions. Critics claimed that the administration used the term as an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Dog-whistle politics|"dog whistle"]] term referring to members of a [[New antisemitism#Anti-globalization movement|Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/globalism-right-trump.html|title=Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump|last=Stack|first=Liam|date=14 November 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/04/06/news-opinion/politics/stephen-bannon-called-jared-kushner-a-globalist-heres-why-the-term-makes-some-jews-uneasy|title=Stephen Bannon reportedly called Jared Kushner a ‘globalist.’ Here’s why the term makes some Jews uneasy.|last=Sales|first=Ben|date=6 April 2017|website=www.jta.org|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/759476/mick-mulvaney-throws-antisemitic-dog-whistle-into-fond-farewell-message-gary-cohn|title=Mick Mulvaney throws an 'anti-Semitic dog whistle' into his fond farewell message to Gary Cohn|last=Weber|first=Peter|date=7 March 2018|work=The Week|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bannon-s-revenge-how-globalism-went-mainstream-ideology-far-right-ncna860221|title=Opinion {{!}} Brian Levin: How globalism became a dirty word in the Trump White House (and America)|last=Levin|first=Brian|date=1 April 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-anti-semitic-globalist-koch-1052375|title=Donald Trump keeps calling adversaries "globalists," despite warnings it's anti-Semitic|last=Goodkind|first=Nicole|date=1 August 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
The word itself came into widespread usage, first and foremost in the United States, from the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ''globalism'' in American-English corpus, 1800–2000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=17&amp;smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 24 October 2014 }}&lt;p&gt;Compare this with ''globalism'' in the [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=globalism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=18&amp;smoothing=0 British-English corpus], where its appearance is later and much more muted.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history.&lt;ref name="Leffler 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|2010|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]'s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] put it in February 1948: "[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. […] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity".&lt;ref name="DoS 524"&gt;{{Harvnb|DoS|1948|p=[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1948v01p2.p0034 524]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; America's allies and foes in [[Eurasia]] were suffering the dreadful effects of World War II at this time.

In their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|Kolko|1972|p=}}.&lt;p&gt;One American historian has gone as far as to describe this particular American version of globalism as ''visionary'', in order to highlight its potently ideological nature—indeed, "Washington's most impressive Cold War ideological achievement". Visionary globalism was a far-reaching conception of "American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking". And "integrating everything" crucially meant global ''economic'' integration, which had collapsed under the blows of World War I and the Great Depression. ({{Harvnb|Peck|2006|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AA-jbmyfl54C&amp;pg=PA21 21]}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the United States to use the term ''[[economic integration]]'' in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) did so at this time: one John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Treasury Department, towards the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Machlup 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, ''economic integration'' was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches.&lt;ref name="Machlup 11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul G. Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]], then head of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]], made the most marked use of the term in a 1949 speech to the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].&lt;ref name="Machlup 11" /&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' put it,

{{Quote| Mr Hoffmann used the word 'integration' fifteen times or almost once to every hundred words of his speech. It is a word that rarely if ever has been used by European statesmen having to do with the Marshall Plan to describe what should happen to Europe's economies. It was remarked that no such term or goal was included in the commitments the European nations gave in agreeing to the Marshall Plan. Consequently it appeared to the Europeans that "integration" was an American doctrine that had been superimposed upon the mutual engagements made when the Marshall Plan began&amp;nbsp;…&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Veseth|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8u99zWdAElUC&amp;pg=PA170 170–1]}}, where the ''Times'' article is reprinted.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While ideologies of the global have a long history, globalism emerged as a dominant set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of [[globalization]] intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steger|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In their recent writings, [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Steger|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel.jpg|thumb|160 px|Johann Albrecht Bengel]]
'''Johann Albrecht Bengel''' (24 June 1687 – 2 November 1752), also known as ''Bengelius'', was a [[Lutheran]] [[pietist]] [[clergyman]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek-language]] scholar known for his edition of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]] and his commentaries on it.

==Life and career==
Bengel was born at [[Winnenden]] in [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Major Bib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weborg|first=C.

Gladding, etc|year=1842|page=2|others=[[Robert Francis Walker]], trans}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a master in the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] at [[Stuttgart]]. In 1703 Bengel left Stuttgart and entered the [[University of Tübingen]] as a student at the ''[[Tübinger Stift]]'', where, in his spare time, he devoted himself especially to the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Spinoza]], and, in theology, to those of [[Philipp Jakob Spener|Philipp Spener]], [[Johann Arndt]] and [[August Francke]]. His knowledge of the [[metaphysics]] of Spinoza was such that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials for a treatise, ''De Spinosismo'', which was afterwards published.

After acquiring his degree, Bengel devoted himself to [[theology]]. Even at this time he had religious doubts; it is interesting in view of his later work that one cause of his perplexities was the difficulty of ascertaining the true reading of certain passages in the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. In 1707 Bengel entered the ministry and was appointed to the parochial charge of [[Metzingen]]-unter-Urach. In the following year he was recalled to Tübingen to undertake the office of ''Repetent'' (theological tutor).

He remained at Tübingen until 1713, when he was appointed head of a seminary recently established at [[Denkendorf, Baden-Württemberg|Denkendorf]] as a preparatory school of theology. Before entering into his new duties he travelled through the greater part of [[Germany]], studying the systems of education which were in use, and visiting the seminaries of the [[Jesuits]] as well as those of the Lutheran and [[Reformed church]]es. Among other places he went to [[Heidelberg]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], and had his attention directed at [[Heidelberg]] to the canons of scripture criticism published by [[Gerhard von Maastricht]], and at Halle to [[Campeius Vitringa]]'s ''Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin''. The influence exerted by these upon his theological studies is manifest in some of his works.

For 28 years, from 1713 to 1741, he was master ({{lang-de|Klosterpraeceptor}}) of the ''Klosterschule'' at Denkendorf, a seminary for candidates for the ministry established in a former monastery of the [[Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre|Canons of the Holy Sepulchre]]. To these years, the period of his greatest intellectual activity, belong many of his chief works.

In 1741 he was appointed prelate (i.e. general superintendent) at [[Herbrechtingen]], where he remained until 1749, when he was raised to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and prelate of [[Alpirsbach]], with a residence in [[Stuttgart]]. He devoted himself to the discharge of his duties as a member of the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]]. A question of considerable difficulty was at that time occupying the attention of the church courts: the manner in which those who separated themselves from the church were to be dealt with, and the amount of toleration which should be accorded to meetings held in private houses for the purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the duke of Württemberg was a [[Roman Catholic]]) was disposed to have recourse to measures of repression, while the members of the consistory, recognizing the good effects of such meetings, were inclined to concede considerable liberty. Bengel exerted himself on the side of the members of the consistory. In 1751 the [[University of Tübingen]] conferred upon him the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]]. He died in [[Stuttgart]], aged 65.

Bengel carried on an 18-year-long controversy with [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf]], leader of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] from [[Herrnhut]] in [[Saxony]]. This led to a break between the Moravian Brethren and the dour Pietism typical of Württemberg, represented by Bengel. With his determined certainty giving him systematic insight into the divine Plan of Salvation, Bengel dogmatically opposed the dynamic, ecumenical, missionary efforts of Zinzendorf, who was indifferent to all dogmatism and intolerance. As Bengel did not hesitate to manipulate historical calendars in his [[chiliasm|chiliastic]] attempts to predict the end of the world, Zinzendorf rejected this as superstitious  “interpretation of signs.”&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph translated from the [[:de:Johann Albrecht Bengel|corresponding article]] in [[:de:Hauptseite|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation as a Biblical scholar and critic rests chiefly on his edition of the Greek New Testament (1734) and his [[Exegesis|exegetical]] annotations on the same, which have passed through many editions in Latin, German, and English and are still highly valued by expositors of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Manson Myers, The Children of Pride, Yale University Press, 1972, p. 1461&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek New Testament==
[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel (timbre RFA).jpg|thumb|Stamp issued by the [[Deutsche Bundespost]] to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Bengel's birth]]
Bengel's edition of the Greek New Testament was published at Tübingen in 1734, and at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical apparatus. As early as 1725, in an addition to his edition of ''Chrysostoms De Sacerdotio'', he had given an account in his ''Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci recte cauteque adornandi'' of the principles on which his intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his work, Bengel was able to avail himself of the collations of upwards of twenty manuscripts, none of them, however, of great importance, twelve of which had been collated by himself. In constituting the text, he imposed upon himself the singular restriction of not inserting any variant reading which had not already been printed in some preceding edition of the Greek text. From this rule, however, he deviated in the case of the [[Apocalypse]], where, owing to the corrupt state of the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce certain readings on manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted a selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he denoted by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following manner: α was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the text; β, a reading better than that in the text; γ, one equal to the textual reading; and δ, readings inferior to those in the text. [[Robert Estienne]]'s division into verses was retained in the inner margin, but the text was divided into paragraphs.

The text was followed by a critical apparatus, the first part of which consisted of an introduction to the criticism of the [[New Testament]], in the thirty-fourth section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated canon, ''Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua'' (The difficult reading is to be preferred to that which is easy), the soundness of which, as a general principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics. The second part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration of the various readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating the evidence both against and in favor of a particular reading, thus placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment. Bengel was the first definitely to propound the theory of families or [[recension]]s of manuscripts.

His investigations had led him to see that a certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of the authorities for the Greek text manuscripts, versions, and ecclesiastical writers: for example, if a peculiar reading was found in one of these, it was generally also found in the other members of the same class; and this general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin for all the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although disposed at first to divide the various documents into three classes, he finally adopted a classification into two: the [[Africa]]n or older family of documents, and the Asiatic, or more recent class, to which he attached only a subordinate value. The theory was afterwards adopted by [[Johann Salomo Semler|J.S. Semler]] and [[Johann Jakob Griesbach|J.J. Griesbach]], and worked up into an elaborate system by the latter critic.

Bengel's labors on the text of the Greek Testament were received with great disfavour in many quarters. Like [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Brian Walton]] and [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] before him, he had to encounter the opposition of those who believed that the certainty of the word of God was endangered by the importance attached to the various readings. [[Johann Jakob Wetstein|JJ Wetstein]], on the other hand, accused him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his critical materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a ''Defence of the Greek Text of His New Testament'', which he prefixed to his ''Harmony of the Four Gospels'', published in 1736, and which contained an answer to the complaints, especially of Wetstein, which had been made against him.

The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation among scholars, and has been frequently reprinted. An enlarged edition of the critical apparatus was published by Philip David Burk in 1763.

==''Gnomon Novi Testamenti''==
The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation as an exegete is mainly based, is his ''Gnomon Novi Testamenti'', or ''Exegetical Annotations on the New Testament'', published in 1742. It was the fruit of twenty years labor, and exhibits with a brevity of expression, which, it has been said, condenses more matter into a line than can be extracted from pages of other writers, the results of his study. He modestly entitled his work a ''[[Gnomon]]'' or index, his object being rather to guide the reader to ascertain the meaning for himself, than to save him from the trouble of personal investigation. The principles of interpretation on which he proceeded were, to import nothing into Scripture, but to draw out of it everything that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical rules not to be hampered by dogmatical considerations; and not to be influenced by the symbolical books. Bengel's hope that the ''Gnomon'' would help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study of the New Testament was fully realized. It has passed through many editions, has been translated into [[German language|German]] and into [[English language|English]] (by [[Marvin Vincent]] in 1860), and is still valued by expositors of the New Testament. [[John Wesley]] made great use of it in compiling his ''Expository Notes upon the New Testament'' (1755).

Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor or author of many others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical and expository. The more important are: ''Ordo Temporum'', a treatise on the chronology of Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations regarding the end of the world, and an ''Exposition of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]]'' which enjoyed for a time great popularity in Germany, and was translated into several languages. His fame was such that almost 200 years later, [[Hermann Hesse]] has the hero of [[The Glass Bead Game]] discuss Bengel's writings.

== Works ==
Joseph Rykwert's preoccupations are many, but some particular themes stand out. His work is fundamentally concerned with the origin of architectural ideas and, having experienced displacement himself at an early age, with our sense of 'place'. In ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World'' (first published in 1963 and in two subsequent editions), rather than accept the archaeologists’ viewpoint of the ancient city as an outcome of practical settlement needs, Rykwert broke new ground in understanding the ancient town as a product of sacred and symbolic rituals. The book served as a timely critique of post-war New Town developments. In ''On Adam’s House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History'' (1972 and subsequent editions) Rykwert examined the persistent idea that architecture could be returned to a lost state of accord with nature, an accord symbolised by the fabled idea that Adam had built a house in Eden. In ''The First Moderns: The Architects of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Rykwert traced the origins of many modern ideas that are commonly assumed to be recent inventions (such as optics and perspective). The book is not a conventional history of style, but rather one of ideas and culture. Frances Yates explained this novelty of approach in ''The Times Literary Supplement'': ‘The range of Rykwert's learning is enormous. History of gardens, Chinese influences, festival architecture, all contribute to the overflowing wealth. Great figures in the history of thought and science — Bacon, Newton, Vico — are seen from new angles....This is no superficial history of styles, no conventional history of ideas. It invigorates both through the attempt at a new kind of history of architecture.’ In ''The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture'' (1996) Rykwert turned his attention to the origins of the architectural Orders, and more recently in ''The Seduction of Place: The History and Future of Cities'' (2000) to the question of how to make successful urban spaces and forms in cities today.

Throughout his career Rykwert has been preoccupied with the work of the Renaissance architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. In 1955 Rykwert published an annotated edition of Leoni's 1756 translation of Alberti's treatise, entitled ''The Ten Books of Architecture, by L.B. Alberti'', and this was followed in 1989 with a new translation from Latin, entitled ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (published with [[Robert Tavernor]] and [[Neil Leach]]). In 1994 Rykwert co-curated (with [[Robert Tavernor]] and Anne Rykwert) an international exhibition on Alberti's work, held at the Palazzo Te in Mantua. Alberti's overlapping interest in architectural theory and practice, and his conception of the architect as a philosopher and student of many arts, led Rykwert to identify him as representing the model architect for an age where the role of the designer is in danger of being reduced to that of a businessman or technocrat. The conception of architecture as a product of inter-related disciplines and as a sister to other visual arts informs Rykwert's latest book, ''The Judicious Eye: Architecture Against the Other Arts'', published in 2008.

Joseph Rykwert married his second wife, Anne, during his time in Essex, and she has been a collaborator on notable works including the international Alberti exhibition and a book on the Adam brothers. Rykwert’s teaching has influenced several generations of architects and historians. Sir James Stirling commented on ''The First Moderns'', for example, that it was: ‘An erudite lead into my favourite period (early nineteenth century) with amazing revelations on the architectural heroes of the time.’ Many of Rykwert’s former pupils have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], Shams Naga, Eric Parry, [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[Robert Tavernor]], [[Vaughan Hart]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. Many university departments of architecture in the United Kingdom or America employ members of staff who were taught by Rykwert.

Unlike many architectural historians before him, Joseph Rykwert has not been concerned with architectural style or the classical language ''per se'', but rather with the meaning of a particular design that should always find its own appropriate expression. Throughout his work he has been concerned with practice as much as with theory, and with the ways in which buildings are actually designed and made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5689">'''Lesbian Art Project''' (1977&amp;nbsp;– 1979) was a [[participatory art]] movement founded by [[Terry Wolverton]] and [[Arlene Raven]] at the [[Woman's Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project| pmid=20408013 | doi=10.1080/10894160903196541 | volume=14| issue=2| journal=J Lesbian Stud| pages=238–59 | last1 = Klein | first1 = J| year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering project focused on giving a platform to [[lesbian]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] perspectives of participants through [[performance]], [[Art|art making]], [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], [[Workshop|workshops]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref name="Journal of Lesbian studies"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lesbian Art Project|author=Jennie Kelin|doi=10.1080/10894160903196541|pmid=20408013|volume=14|issue=2|journal=J Lesbian Stud|pages=238–59|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant piece of work created during the project was ''An Oral [[Herstory]] of Lesbianism'', in 1979, which documented lesbian women and their feelings, views, experiences, and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wack! Audio Tour: Lesbian Art Project, Carolee Schneemann, Suzy Lake, Judith F. Baca|url=http://sites.moca.org/wack/2007/07/25/wack-audio-tour-lesbian-art-project-carolee-schneemann-suzy-lake-judith-f-baca/|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203154528/http://sites.moca.org/wack/2007/07/25/wack-audio-tour-lesbian-art-project-carolee-schneemann-suzy-lake-judith-f-baca/|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lesbian Art Project was part of an ongoing effort by [[Arlene Raven]], co-founder of the [[Woman's Building|LA Woman's Building]], to incorporate lesbian-oriented programming into the [[Woman's Building#Feminist Studio Workshop|Feminist Studio Workshop]], which had already launched the Los Angeles League for the Advancement of Lesbianism in the Arts (LALALA) in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787515|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTyBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq|editor=Bonnie Zimmerman|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and artists influenced by the tenets of [[postmodernism]] dismissed much of the art work made in the 1970s from a lesbian feminist perspective. This has resulted in very little being known or written about this pioneering work. The activities and events associated with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles have played a larger role in lesbian [[art history]] than is often acknowledged. The project began with six women (started by Terry Wolverton) working collectively with a common goal of increasing opportunity for lesbian artists and writing a chapter of lesbian art.  This small group disbanded in less than a year but Wolverton and Raven continued in their pursuit of a Lesbian Art Movement.  As they continued their project they became astonishingly productive, and they were able to integrate the Lesbian Art Project with the curriculum of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman’s Building.

At the Woman's Building they were able to organize a major performance event based on lesbian identities: ''The Oral Herstory of Lesbianism (Oral)''. Advertised as "Storytelling, Theater and Magic for Women Only",&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Norma, and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. "The power of feminist art: The American movement of the 1970s, history and impact." (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the project was directed by Wolverton and its stories generated through a workshop for the thirteen performers.

Along with the major performance event, a database for lesbian artists was now in existence. Wolverton and Raven went their separate ways before completing the book they had planned but both continued to individually promote feminist and lesbian art.     
  
A partial successor to the LAP was the 1980 [[Great American Lesbian Art Show]] (GALAS), also at the Woman's Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Identity Kit: The Great American Lesbian Art Show|last = Thompson|first = Margo Hobbs|date = 20 April 2010|journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume = 14|issue = 2–3|doi = 10.1080/10894160903196558|pmid = 20408014|pages=260–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Microwave sounding unit]] temperature measurements''' have been obtained from the [[troposphere]] since 1979, when they were included within NOAA [[weather satellite]]s.  By comparison, the usable balloon ([[radiosonde]]) record begins in 1958 but has less geographic coverage and is less uniform.

[[Satellite]]s do not measure [[temperature]].  They measure [[radiance]]s in various [[wavelength]] bands, which must then be mathematically [[Inverse problem|inverted]] to obtain [[Remote sensing#Data processing|indirect inferences]] of temperature.&lt;ref name="NRC2000"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I.

As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have obtained different temperature trends. Among these groups are [[Remote Sensing Systems]] (RSS) and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The satellite series is not fully homogeneous - the record is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation. The sensors deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for satellite drift in orbit. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

To compare to the trend from the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperature record]] (approximately +0.07&amp;nbsp;°C/decade over the past century and +0.15-0.16&amp;nbsp;°C/decade since 1979) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface, i.e., the lower [[troposphere]].  Doing this, through January 2012:
* RSS v3.3 finds a trend of +0.137&amp;nbsp;°C/decade.&lt;ref name="RSS"/&gt;
* UAH v5.4 finds a trend of +0.136&amp;nbsp;°C/decade.&lt;ref name="UAH TLT"/&gt;

There have been complaints of data problems with both records, and difficulty reconciling climate model predictions with the observed data.

==Creation of the satellite temperature record==
[[File:Weighting Function.png|thumb|MSU weighting function.]]
{{Main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
Since 1979, [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) on [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric [[oxygen]]. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere, as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061135/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png |date=2013-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 2 is broadly representative of the troposphere, albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the stratospheric influence, Spencer and Christy developed the synthetic "2LT" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However this amplifies noise,&lt;ref name="Christy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=John R. |authorlink= |author2=Spencer, Roy W. |author3=Lobl, Elena S.  |year=1998 |title=Analysis of the Merging Procedure for the MSU Daily Temperature Time Series |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2016&amp;ndash;2041 |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011&lt;2016:AOTMPF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1998JCli...11.2016.}}&lt;/ref&gt; increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination.&lt;ref name="Fu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fu |first=Qiang |authorlink= |author2=Johanson, Celeste M. |year=2005 |title=Satellite-Derived Vertical Dependence Of Tropical Tropospheric Temperature Trends |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=L10703 |doi=10.1029/2004GL022266 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210703F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.

Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs and AMSU data, each with peculiarities  that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/960521SM.html The Satellite Temperature Records: Parts 1 and 2] May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult and some of the required corrections are as large as the trend itself:&lt;ref name="CCSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|title=CCSP sap 1.1|accessdate=2011-01-15|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224094945/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Diurnal sampling

All the MSU instruments and to a lesser extent AMSU drift slowly from the sun-synchronous equatorial crossing time changing the local time observed by the instrument, therefore the natural diurnal cycle may be aliased into the long term trend. 
The diurnal sampling correction is in the order of a few hundredths °C/decade for TLT and TMT.

; Orbit decay

All Polar orbiting satellite lose height after launch, the orbital decay is stronger during period of elevated solar activity when the enhanced ultraviolet radiation warm the upper atmosphere and increase the frictional drag over the spacecraft.

The orbital decay change the instrument view angle relative to the surface and thus the observed microwave emissivity, furthermore the long term time-series is constructed by sequential merging of the inter-calibrated satellite data so that the error is summed up over time, the required correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for TLT.

; Calibration changes

Once every earth scan MSU instrument use the deep space (2.7K) and on-board warm targets to make calibration measures, however as the spacecraft drifts through the diurnal cycle the calibration target temperature may change due to varying solar shadowing effect, the correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for TLT and TMT.

One widely reported satellite temperature record, developed by [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] and [[John Christy]] at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH), is current version  corrects previous errors in their analysis for orbital drift and other factors.  The record comes from a succession of different satellites and problems with inter-calibration between the satellites are important, especially NOAA-9, which accounts for most of the difference between the RSS and UAH analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123040542/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html |date=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears ''et al.'' identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2.&lt;ref name="Mears2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mears |first=Carl A. |authorlink= |author2=Wentz, Frank J. |year=2005 |title=The Effect of Diurnal Correction on Satellite-Derived Lower Tropospheric Temperature |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5740 |pages=1548&amp;ndash;1551 |doi=10.1126/science.1114772 |url= |accessdate= |quote=|pmid=16141071 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1548M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of satellite temperature data interpretation==
In the late 1990s the disagreement between the surface temperature record and the satellite records was a subject of research and debate. The lack of warming then seen in the records was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |title=Christy and Spencer Respond to Critics; Water Vapor Still Not Resolved |accessdate= |work=Cooler Heads Coalition |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911190509/http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |archivedate=2007-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] that reviewed upper air temperature trends stated:
                                                             
:"Data collected by satellites and balloon-borne instruments since 1979 indicate little if any warming of the low- to mid-troposphere—the atmospheric layer extending up to about 5 miles from the Earth's surface. Climate models generally predict that temperatures should increase in the upper air as well as at the surface if increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are causing the warming."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9755/reconciling-observations-of-global-temperature-change?onpi_newsdoc011200= The National Academies], "Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change", 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The same panel then concluded that

:"the warming trend in global-mean surface temperature observations during the past 20 years is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the average rate of warming during the twentieth century. The disparity between surface and upper air trends in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change |author=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate |year=2000 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-06891-6 |pages=1&amp;ndash;4 |chapter=Executive Summary |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/books/0309068916/html/2.html#pagetop }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llanos2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Miguel |last=Llanos |title=Panel weighs in on global warming: Earth’s surface is warmer, they say, even if upper air isn’t |url=http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |work=MSNBC |publisher= |date=2000-01-13 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427072934/http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the UAH data showed a ''cooling'' of 0.05K per decade (at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km - mid to low troposphere). Wentz &amp; Schabel at RSS in their 1998 paper showed this (along with other discrepancies) was due to the orbital decay of the NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115152656/http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |archive-date=2010-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the orbital changes had been allowed for the data showed a 0.07K per decade ''increase'' in temperature at this level of the atmosphere.

In April 2002, for example, an analysis of the satellite temperature data showed warming of only 0.04&amp;nbsp;°C per decade, compared with surface measurements showing 0.17 ±  0.06&amp;nbsp;°C per decade.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Doubts had been raised as early as 2000 about the UAH analysis by the work of Prabhakara et al.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2000/2000GL011719.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; which minimised errors due to satellite drift. They found a trend of 0.13&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, in reasonable agreement with surface trends.

Christy ''et al.'' (2007) find that the tropical temperature trends from [[radiosondes]] matches closest with his v5.2 UAH dataset.&lt;ref name="Christy2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=J. R. |authorlink= |author2=Norris, W. B. |author3=Spencer, R. W. |author4= Hnilo, J.

Another important critique of the satellite record is its shortness&amp;mdash;adding a few years on to the record or picking a particular time frame can change the trends considerably.

Likewise, even though they began with the same data, each of the major research groups has interpreted it with different results. Most notably, Mears et al. at RSS find 0.193&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123&amp;nbsp;°C/decade found by UAH for the same period.

There are ongoing efforts to resolve these differences.  Some believe that much of the disparity may have been resolved by the three papers in Science, 11 August 2005, which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.

==Stratospheric temperature trends==
The satellites also measure the lower stratospheric temperature{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and show a decline in stratospheric temperatures, interspersed by warmings related to volcanic eruptions. [[Global Warming]] theory suggests that the [[stratosphere]] should cool while the [[troposphere]] warms &lt;ref name="Clough 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clough |first=S.A. |authorlink= |author2=M.

However, the lower stratospheric cooling is mainly caused by the effects of [[ozone depletion]] with a possible contribution from increased stratospheric water vapor and greenhouse gases increase.&lt;ref name="Shine 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shine |first=Keith |author2=M.S.

The long term cooling in the lower stratosphere occurred in two downward steps in temperature both after the transient warming related to explosive volcanic eruptions of [[El Chichón]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], this behavior of the global stratospheric temperature has been attributed to global ozone concentration variation in the two years following volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=David W.

==Reconciliation of data with climate models==
[[General circulation model|Climate model]]s predict that as the surface warms, so should the global troposphere. Globally, the troposphere should warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface. For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing [[algorithm]]) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm United Nations Environment Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112044011/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis produced by dozens of scientists as part of the US [[Climate Change Science Program]] (CCSP) identified and corrected errors in a variety of temperature observations, including the satellite data.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423150153/http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary] states:
:"Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human induced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."

The [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers] states:
:"New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR."

However, as detailed in [https://web.archive.org/web/20101224095341/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap5.pdf CCSP SAP 5.1 Understanding and Reconciling Differences], neither Regression models or other related techniques were reconcilable with observed data.  The use of fingerprinting techniques on data yielded that "Volcanic and human-caused fingerprints were not consistently identifiable in observed patterns of lapse rate change."  As such, issues with reconciling data and models remain.

A potentially serious inconsistency has been identified in the tropics, the area in which tropospheric amplification should be seen. Section 1.1 of the CCSP report says:

: "In the tropics, the agreement between models and observations depends on the time scale considered. For month-to-month and year-to-year variations, models and observations both show amplification (i.e., the month-to-month and year-to-year variations are larger aloft than at the surface). This is a consequence of relatively simple physics, the effects of the release of latent heat as air rises and condenses in clouds. The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations. On decadal and longer time scales, however, while almost all model simulations show greater warming aloft (reflecting the same physical processes that operate on the monthly and annual time scales), most observations show greater warming at the surface.

: "These results could arise either because “real world” amplification effects on short and long time scales are controlled by different physical mechanisms, and models fail to capture such behavior; or because non-climatic influences remaining in some or all of the observed tropospheric data sets lead to biased long-term trends; or a combination of these factors. The new evidence in this Report favors the second explanation."

The lower troposphere trend derived from UAH satellites (+0.128&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is currently lower than both the GISS and Hadley Centre surface station network trends (+0.161 and +0.160&amp;nbsp;°C/decade respectively), while the RSS trend (+0.158&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is similar. However, the expected trend in the lower troposphere, given the surface data, would be around 0.194&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, making the UAH and RSS trends 66% and 81% of the expected value respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">[[File:Ma’oz Hayyim.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Ma’oz Hayyim Synagogue]]
The '''Maoz Haim Synagogue''' was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a simple [[Byzantine]]-era type [[basilica]] building, later apsidical, in the [[Beit She'an]] region in northern [[Israel]]. Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya’aqobi during some unrelated digging near [[Maoz Haim]], it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211&lt;/ref&gt; The [[synagogue]] was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for [[Jews]] there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=Levine89&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;אפרים שטרן. אנציקלופדיה החדשה לחפירות ארכיאולוגית בארץ ישראל&lt;/ref&gt; There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the [[Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards [[Jerusalem]]. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.

==Apse==
The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a [[chancel screen]] which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised [[bima]] area is what shows that this was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as [[Hebrew]] letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was [[Shalom]]; the remainder of the inscriptions were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaic Floor==
There were many interesting [[mosaic]]s which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an [[etrog]], a [[shofar]] and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of [[geometric patterns]]. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards.&lt;ref name=Levine89/&gt; Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Modified Stave Notation (MSN)''' is an alternative way of notating music that was developed in the [[UK]] where it is widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/leisureculture/music/readingmusic/Pages/modstave.aspx Modified Stave Notation - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; MSN is intended to be used by people who cannot easily read ordinary musical [[Staff (music)|stave notation]] (or staff notation&lt;ref&gt;''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case; ''stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''. (Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.)&lt;/ref&gt;), even if it is enlarged, or for some people reduced in size. Such users include those with [[visual impairment]]s and those who are [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]].

== History of Modified Stave Notation ==

In the 1990s the then [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]], negotiated with the [[Music Publishers Association (UK)|Music Publishers' Association]] an agreement to permit partially sighted people to enlarge music, providing only one copy was made and the enlarged music was not re-sold. For each item enlarged, permission was needed from the work's publisher who would then supply a yellow sticker with "MPA approved '''large print''' music copy RNIB" written over a five line stave. It was noted, however, at this time that enlargement produced new problems, notably with the extra space between symbols and the production of either unwieldy large and flimsy [[Sheet music|sheets]] or scores requiring more page turns and not necessarily in convenient places. So examples of music in which all signs equally enlarged but compacted horizontally were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ockelford, A. (1994) "Music in large print" Royal National Institute for the Blind and The Music Publishers' Association Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s some music publishers started producing music in [[Large-print|large print]] fonts, taking layouts used widely for children's beginner tutor books and extending these to short [[Musical repertoire|repertoire pieces]], particularly for [[keyboard instrument]]s. The National Music and Disability Information Service&lt;ref&gt;National Music and Disability Information Service 1982 to 1998, based at Dartington Hall. This service was then taken under the umbrella of Soundsense, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. [http://www.soundsense.org/ Sound sense]&lt;/ref&gt; kept a resource paper "RP14 Information on Music for People with Partial Sight" which listed some of these publishers.

With the advent of sophisticated [[Scorewriter|music notation software]], such as MuseScore,&lt;ref&gt;[https://musescore.org/en/tutorials/modified-stave-notation musescore.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the production of MSN became easier, with the ability to save preferred settings of each user. The Royal National Institute of Blind People is the largest formal producer of MSN in the world, with a production team based in [[Ivybridge]], [[Devon]]. MSN has become an accepted standard for public examinations in England and Wales, for [[GCSE]] and [[A level]] music and music technology papers, under general special arrangements authorised by the [[Joint Council for Qualifications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcq.org.uk/ Joint Council for Qualifications]&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide for sight reading tests for grade examination boards such as the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-booking/special-needs/guidelines-for-candidates-with-dyslexia-dyspraxia-or-other-learning-difficulties/ Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trinity College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1315 Trinity College London]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates requiring Modified Print copies of the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] may ask for MSN scores, sometimes in a standard format, sometimes tailor made to match a submitted example.

== Standards for Modified Stave Notation ==

Formalising standards for MSN in the UK involved:
* discussion amongst producers 
* experiments with users and
* examination with software producers of the variables within packages. 
The work was underpinned by links with [[RNIB| RNIB's]] general print guidelines for making information accessible for blind and partially sighted people, "See it Right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/accessibleinformation/pages/see_it_right.aspx See It Right - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; Reading music notation is more complex than reading prose involving complex [[Eye movement in music reading|eye movements]]. Not only are there many symbols of different shapes and sizes, but the signs are placed in [[vertical direction|vertical]] as well as [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimensions, some having effect for lines of music whilst others just apply to single features. Often the reader needs to read "in time" rather than at his or her own speed, alongside the execution of complex physical skills to render the symbols into sound via an [[musical instrument|instrument]]. Usually music is placed further away than ordinary print, allowing for an instrument to be placed between player and the printed music. There may also be the need to see a [[musical director]] in the middle distance. With [[E-book reader|eReading devices]] it is easy to obtain ordinary print consistently in one's preferred font size and type face. However, stave notation comes in all kinds of densities, type faces and relative symbols size. Modified Stave Notation can enable users to have consistent size and layout.

== Guidelines for Modified Stave Notation ==

Guidelines for the production of Modified Stave Notation are published by the UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  in document "G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org/members-area/guidance-documents/#G009 G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of producing Modified Stave Notation are: 
* clear printing of symbols with no overlapping of different signs
* evening out the symbol size and density
* reducing redundant space
* placing symbols used around the stave at a consistent distance from the lines and the notes to which they refer (so once one is located, the reader can reasonably expect to find them in the same place later in the piece), and, 
* describe in words in a preface the location of sporadic or unusual symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, S-A. (2004) "Modified Stave Notation - An Approach to Making Stave Notation More Accessible to Users Who Are Partially Sighted" in K.Miesenberger et al. [Eds.] ICCHP 2004, LNCS 3118, pp. 236-239 Springer-Verlag: Berlin and Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other factors assisting accessibility ==

In addition to the alteration of stave notation layout in MSN, other factors affecting [[accessibility]] include binding, colour of background paper (as stave notation is conventionally in black ink) and lighting. The use of multimedia can also increase accessibility. For example, the music seen can also be heard electronically with a variety of levels of "interpretation" from just the pitch and note lengths, to full nuance and stylistic detail. Lastly, analysis and development of reading and memorisation techniques, pertinent to the user's requirements, may aid fluency.

== General principles of clear print used in Modified Stave Notation ==

Some principles from RNIB's guidelines 'See It Right' are transferred directly to stave notation in MSN. The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 [[Point (typography)|point]] typefaces. Spaces between systems&lt;ref&gt;The distance between the sets of music lines (2 for piano music, usually, or 3 for voice and piano, for example)&lt;/ref&gt; and between staves within a system are sufficiently large, although more use is made of left and right margins. Text is [[sans-serif|sans serif]],&lt;ref&gt;That is, without the "curly" edges to letters common in fonts such as Times New Roman&lt;/ref&gt; semi-bold or bold.

== Other modification in Modified Stave Notation ==

Numerals are used in music for all kinds of purposes: in MSN page numbers are distinguished from bar numbers, by being placed in circles, for example. In MSN the use of full size numerals for fingering rather than subscript size is a particular feature. Fingering numbers are also often place in a horizontal line rather than dipping up and down to follow the contour of the [[melody]], enabling a user to memorise the melody and then just follow the fingering numbers.

The need for text to follow easily from column to column, page to page, is especially important in MSN where page turns need to occur where possible at a place where there are bars or at least at suitable musical breaks. Many users of modified print materials read them with additional technological help, such as a closed circuit television screen: for this, the pages need to be able to lie flat. Much music is written in portrait format,&lt;ref&gt;Portrait format is that in which the longer sides of a sheet of paper is at the sides, whereas landscape format is where the longer sides of the paper are at the top and bottom&lt;/ref&gt; whereas landscape is preferred for MSN to reduce the number of times the reader has to track back to the beginning of a new system.

MSN using music notation software enables dyslexic and partially sighted people who struggle to use the huge variety of formats of stave notation to have their music produced in a consistent layout, according to certain conventions, allowing more fluent use.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, E. (2011) "Behind bars: The Definitive Guide to Music Notation" London: Faber Music&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14052">In contemporary art, '''monumental sculpture''' is large sculpture regardless of purpose, carrying a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture. In ancient and medieval sculpture, size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures may also be labelled monumental sculpture. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may be attributed to monumental sculpture.

Historically monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance. A culture may cease to produce monumental sculpture due to [[societal collapse]] or [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated.[[File:Moissac Abbaye portail sud.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] portal of [[Moissac]] Abbey; a classic example of what is meant by "monumental sculpture" in ancient and medieval art history.]]

==Defining ''monumental''==
The term ''monumental sculpture'' is often used in [[art history]] and [[Art criticism|criticism]], but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians,&lt;ref&gt;For example, none of the figures in sculptures at the [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] are larger than this, and they are described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as "one of the largest groups of monumental carving in Spanish [[Romanesque art]]". Schapiro, 29&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[contemporary art]] a rather larger overall scale is implied.  Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable [[figurine]]s, small metal or [[ivory]] [[relief]]s, [[diptych]]s and the like.

It is also used of sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a [[monument]] of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, [[tomb monument]]s or [[memorial]]s, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just [[funerary art|funerary]] sculpture for [[church architecture|church monuments]].  A related idea is that of permanence, emphasized in some discussions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are.  The entry for "Monumental" in "A Dictionary of Art and Artists" by [[Peter Murray (art historian)|Peter and Linda Murray]] describes it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Monumental|title=A Dictionary of Art and Artists|edition=Revised|publisher=Penguin|year=1968|author=Peter and Linda Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most overworked word in current art history and criticism.  It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for 'large'.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or "used in a memorial" may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate.  For example, when [[Meyer Schapiro]], after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at [[Moissac]], says: "in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the south portal [''(right)''] the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental.  It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance.  It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ...",&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 201&lt;/ref&gt; size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiro's further comments suggest that a lack of "excess of virtuousity" does not form part of what he intends to convey.  Nonetheless, parts of the Murray's concept ("grand, noble, elevated in idea") are included in his meaning, although "simple in conception and execution" hardly seems to apply.

==Meaning in different contexts==
The term 'Monumental Sculptures' has acquired various meanings over the years, but these different meanings have not caused much difficulty in classification, as the various interpretations incorporate the changing nature of sculptures through temporal and spacial landscapes in this category.&lt;ref&gt;The Getty [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=monumental&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300073760 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online] definition only refers to "Very large, comparable to a typical monument in massiveness", but the notes below on the many reference works consulted give a range of different emphases on size and function.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may be used differently for different periods in history, with breaks occurring around the [[Renaissance]] and the early 20th century. The ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures can also be addressed by the term. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may have been meant, but the meaning of size was once again adopted while referring to contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, concerned with funerary sculpture only are:''The Silent Rhetoric of the Body A History of Monumental Sculpture and Commemorative Art in England, 1720–1770'', by Matthew Craske, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-13541-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13541-1}} [http://www.yalebooks.co.uk/yale/display.asp?K=9780300135411&amp;bic=AFKB&amp;sort=SORT_DATE/d&amp;ds=Sculpture&amp;m=9&amp;dc=44]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, and several of the titles covered on the [http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm bibliography page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112536/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm |date=2009-01-01 }} of the website of the Church Monuments Society.

==In art history==

===Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture===
In [[archeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''A shorter history of Greek art'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-28084-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22monumental+sculpture%22&amp;ei=iiL3SbqpFZS6M8Hm0eQD Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology.  The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization.
[[File:Nim Li Punit stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maya stela]]]]

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC and may be older than the [[Pyramids of Egypt]].  Recent unexpected discoveries of Ancient Chinese [[bronze age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals.  The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed.  Other cultures, such as Ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger, "Monumental Architecture: A Thermodynamic Explanation of Symbolic Behaviour Author", World Archaeology, vo.22, no.2, 1990, pp.119-132. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Disappearance of monumental sculpture===
There may be a number of reasons why a culture ceases to produce monumental sculpture. The most common is [[societal collapse]], as occurred in Europe during the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] or the [[Classic Maya collapse]] in [[Mesoamerica]].  Another may be [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated, as followed the [[Muslim conquests]].  Both the rise of Christianity (initially) and later the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a halt to religious monumental sculpture in the regions concerned, and greatly reduced production of any monumental sculpture for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt; Post, Chandler Rathfon, A History of European and American Sculpture: From the Early Christian Period to the Present Day, Volume l, Harvard University Press, London, 1921 p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]], which had largely avoided the societal collapse in the [[Western Roman Empire]], never resumed the use of monumental figurative sculpture, whether in religious or secular contexts, and was to ban even two-dimensional religious art for a period in the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]].

==Contemporary work==
Monumental sculpture is still used within the stoneworking and funeral trades to cover all forms of grave headstones and other funerary art, regardless of size.  In contemporary art, however, it is used to refer to all large sculptures regardless of purpose, and also carries a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, several uses of the term in [http://www.sculpture.org.uk/blog/monumentally-virtual-ephemerally-physical-directions-in-new-sculpture-and-new-media "Monumentally Virtual, Ephemerally Physical: Directions in new sculpture and new media"], blogpost by Joseph Taylor McRae, Lecturer in Computer Games Arts and editor of Art/Games Journal, published on May 25th, 2016, by the [[Cass Sculpture Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures covered by the term in modern art are likely to be over two metres in at least one dimension, and sufficiently large not to need a high [[plinth]], though they may have one.  Many are still commissioned as [[public art]], often for placing at outdoor sites.

===Quantum Dot Enhancement Film (QDEF)===
{{see also|Quantum dot display}}
Nanosys Quantum Dot Enhancement Film, or QDEF, is an optical film component for LED driven LCDs. Each sheet of QDEF contains trillions of tiny [[Quantum Dot]] [[Phosphors]]. QDEF enables [[LED-backlit LCD]]s to be brighter and more colorful by providing a high quality, tri-color white light from a standard blue [[LED]] light source. Larger than a water molecule, but smaller than a virus, these tiny phosphors convert blue light from a standard [[Gallium Nitride]] (GaN) LED into different wavelengths based upon their size. Larger dots emit longer wavelengths (red), while smaller dots emit shorter wavelengths (green). Blending together a mix of dot colors allows Nanosys to precisely engineer a new spectrum of light to customer specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| title = The Economist: Dotting The Eyes, How tiny crystals can improve picture quality
| date = June 16, 2011
| accessdate = July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quantum Dots are tuned to create better color by changing their size during fabrication to emit light at just the right wavelengths. Traditional light emitting materials such as crystal phosphors have a broad fixed spectrum. Quantum dots can convert light to nearly any color in the visible spectrum, giving display designers the ability to tune and match the spectrum more accurately to color filters while improving energy efficiency.
Designed to replace the functionality of a diffuser sheet while actively converting color, QDEF can be added to an LCD's film stack with little change in overall thickness or manufacturing process (Fig 1).

QDEF was announced on May 17, 2011 at the [[Society for Information Display]] (SID) Display Week tradeshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik
|title=Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health
|publisher=Oxford University Press

|isbn=0-19-974045-3
|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P. (2011) Singular Mechanisms and Bayesian Narratives in ed. Pierre Demeulenaere, ''Analytical Sociology and Social Mechanisms'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009a"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

'''Neurophilosophy''' or '''philosophy of neuroscience''' is the interdisciplinary study of [[neuroscience]] and [[philosophy]] that explores the relevance of [[neuroscientific]] studies to the arguments traditionally categorized as [[philosophy of mind]]. The philosophy of neuroscience attempts to clarify neuroscientific methods and results using the conceptual rigor and methods of [[philosophy of science]].

==The indirectness of studies of mind and brain==
Many of the methods and techniques central to neuroscientific discovery rely on assumptions that can limit the interpretation of the data. Philosophers of neuroscience have discussed such assumptions in the use of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]],&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack(2010)"Subtraction and Beyond" in Hanson and Bunzl, Human Brain Mapping. pp. 147–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein C. (2010) "Philosophical Issues in Neuroimaging" Philosophy Compass 5(2) pp. 186–198&lt;/ref&gt; dissociation in cognitive [[neuropsychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Dunn (2003) "The Elusive Dissociation" cortex 39 no. 1 pp. 21–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn and Kirsner. 2003. What can we infer from double dissociations?&lt;/ref&gt; [[single unit recording]],&lt;ref&gt;deCharms and Zandor (2000) "Neural Representation and the temporal code" Annual Review of Neuroscience 23: pp. 613–47&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Winsberg (2003)"Simulated Experiments: a Methodology for the Virtual World" Philosophy of Science.vol 70 no 1 105–125&lt;/ref&gt; Following are descriptions of many of the current controversies and debates about the methods employed in neuroscience.

===fMRI===
Many fMRI studies rely heavily on the assumption of "localization of function"&lt;ref&gt;Huettel, Song and McCarthy ''Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging'' 2009 Sinauer Associates pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; (same as [[functional specialization]]). Localization of function means that many cognitive functions can be localized to specific brain regions. A good example of functional localization comes from studies of the motor cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Passingham, R. E. Stephan, K. E. Kotter, R."The anatomical basis of functional localization in the cortex"Nature Reviews Neuroscience. 2002, VOL 3; PART 8, pages 606–616&lt;/ref&gt; There seem to be different groups of cells in the motor cortex responsible for controlling different groups of muscles. Many philosophers of neuroscience criticize fMRI for relying too heavily on this assumption. Michael Anderson points out that subtraction method fMRI misses a lot of brain information that is important to the cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson.(2007) "The Massive Redeployment Hypothesis and Functional Topography of the Brain" Philosophical Psychology Vol20 no 2 pp.144–149&lt;/ref&gt; Subtraction fMRI only shows the differences between the task activation and the control activation, but many of the brain areas activated in the control are obviously important for the task as well.

Some philosophers entirely reject any notion of localization of function and thus believe fMRI studies to be profoundly misguided.&lt;ref&gt;The Massive Redeployment Hypothesis and Functional Topography of the Brain" Philosophical Psychology Vol20 no 2 pp.149–152&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers maintain that brain processing acts holistically, that large sections of the brain are involved in processing most cognitive tasks (see [[holism]] in neurology and the modularity section below). {{anchor|radio repair man}}One way to understand their objection to the idea of localization of function is the radio repair man thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Bunzel, Hanson, and Poldrack "An Exchange about Localization of Function" Human Brain Mapping. pp.50&lt;/ref&gt; In this thought experiment, a radio repair man opens up a radio and rips out a tube. The radio begins whistling loudly and the radio repair man declares that he must have ripped out the anti-whistling tube. There is no anti-whistling tube in the radio and the radio repair man has confounded function with effect. This criticism was originally targeted at the logic used by neuropsychological brain lesion experiments, but the criticism is still applicable to neuroimaging. These considerations are similar to Van Orden's and Paap's criticism of circularity in neuroimaging logic.&lt;ref&gt;VanOrden, G and Paap, K "Functional Neuroimaging fails to discover Pieces of the Mind" Philosophy of science. 64 pp. S85-S94&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, neuroimagers assume that their theory of cognitive component parcellation is correct and that these components divide cleanly into feed-forward modules. These assumptions are necessary to justify their inference of brain localization. The logic is circular if the researcher then use the appearance of brain region activation as proof of the correctness of their cognitive theories.

A different problematic methodological assumption within fMRI research is the use of reverse inference&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack (2006)"Can Cognitive Processes be inferred from Neuroimaging Data"Trends in Cognitive Sciences. vol 10 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse inference is when the activation of a brain region is used to infer the presence of a given cognitive process. Poldrack points out that the strength of this inference depends critically on the likelihood that a given task employs a given cognitive process and the likelihood of that pattern of brain activation given that cognitive process. In other words, the strength of reverse inference is based upon the selectivity of the task used as well as the selectivity of the brain region activation. A 2011 article published in the NY times has been heavily criticized for misusing reverse inference.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, B "Do you Really love Your iPhone that Way" http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-decision-tree/201110/do-you-really-love-your-iphone-way&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, participants were shown pictures of their iPhones and the researchers measured activation of the insula. The researches took insula activation as evidence of feelings of love and concluded that people loved their iPhones. Critics were quick to point out that the insula is not a very selective piece of cortex, and therefore not amenable to reverse inference.

The Neuropsychologist [[Max Coltheart]] took the problems with reverse inference a step further and challenged neuroimagers to give one instance in which neuroimaging had informed psychological theory&lt;ref&gt;Coltheart, M(2006b), "What Has Functional Neuroimaging Told Us about the Mind (So Far)?", Cortex 42: 323–331.&lt;/ref&gt; Coltheart takes the burden of proof to be an instance where the brain imaging data is consistent with one theory but inconsistent with another theory. Roskies maintains that Coltheart's ultra cognitive position makes his challenge unwinnable.&lt;ref&gt;Rooskies, A. (2009)"Brain-Mind and Structure-Function Relations: A methodological Response to Coltheart" Philosophy of Science. vol 76&lt;/ref&gt; Since Coltheart maintains that the implementation of a cognitive state has no bearing on the function of that cognitive state, then it is impossible to find neuroimaging data that will be able to comment on psychological theories in the way Coltheart demands. Neuroimaging data will always be relegated to the lower level of implementation and be unable to selectively determine one or another cognitive theory. In a 2006 article, Richard Henson suggests that forward inference can be used to infer dissociation of function at the psychological level.&lt;ref&gt;Henson, R (2006)"Forward Inference Using Functional Neuroimaging: Dissociations vs Associations" Trends in Cognitive Sciences vol 10 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that these kinds of inferences can be made when there is crossing activations between two task types in two brain regions and there is no change in activation in a mutual control region.

One final assumption worth mentioning is the assumption of pure insertion in fMRI.&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack "Subtraction and Beyond" in Hanson and Bunzl Human Brain Mapping pp. 147–160&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of pure insertion is the assumption that a single cognitive process can be inserted into another set of cognitive processes without affecting the functioning of the rest. For example, if you wanted to find the reading comprehension area of the brain, you might scan participants while they were presented with a word and while they were presented with a non-word (e.g. "Floob"). If you infer that the resulting difference in brain pattern represents the regions of the brain involved in reading comprehension, you have assumed that these changes are not reflective of changes in task difficulty or differential recruitment between tasks. The term pure insertion was coined by Donders as a criticism of reaction time methods.

Recently, researchers have begun using a new functional imaging technique called resting state functional connectivity MRI.&lt;ref&gt;Wig, Schlaggar, and Peterson (2011) "Concepts and Principals in the Analysis of Brain Networks" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1224&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects' brains are scanned while the subject sits idly in the scanner. By looking at the natural fluctuations in the bold pattern while the subject is at rest, the researchers can see which brain regions co-vary in activation together. They can use the patterns of covariance to construct maps of functionally linked brain areas. The name "functional connectivity" is somewhat misleading since the data only indicates co-variation. Still, this is a powerful method for studying large networks throughout the brain. There are a couple of important methodological issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there are many different possible brain mappings that could be used to define the brain regions for the network. The results could vary significantly depending on the brain region chosen. Secondly, what mathematical techniques are best about to characterize these brain regions?

The brain regions of interest are somewhat constrained by the size of the voxels. Rs-fcMRI uses voxels that are few millimeters cubed so the brain regions will have to be defined on a larger scale. Two of the statistical methods that are commonly applied to network analysis can work on the single voxel spatial scale, but graph theory methods are extremely sensitive to the way nodes are defined. Brains regions can be divided according to their cellular architectural, according to their connectivity, or according to physiological measures. Alternatively, you could take a theory neutral approach and randomly divide the cortex into partitions of the size of your choosing. As mentioned earlier, there are several approaches to network analysis once the your brain regions have been defined. Seed based analysis begins with an a priori defined seed region and finds all of the regions that are functionally connected to that region. Wig et al. caution that the resulting network structure will not give any information concerning the inter-connectivity of the identified regions or the relations of those regions to regions other than the seed region. Another approach is to use independent component analysis to create spatio-temporal component maps and the components are sorted by components that carry information of interest and those that are caused by noise. Wigs et al. once again warns that inference of functional brain region communities is difficult under ICA. ICA also has the issue of imposing orthogonality on the data.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford et al (2010) "Detecting network modules in fMRI time series: A weighted network analysis approach" Neuroimage. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Graph theory uses a matrix to characterize covariance between regions which is then transformed into a network map. The problem with graph theory analysis is that network mapping is heavily influenced by a priori brain region and connectivity (nodes and edges), thus the researcher is at risk for cherry picking regions and connections according to their own theories. However, graph theory analysis is extremely valuable since it is the only method that gives pair-wise relationships between nodes. ICA has the added advantage of being a fairly principled method. It seems that using both methods will be important in uncovering the network connectivity of the brain. Mumford et al. hoped to avoid these issues and use a principled approach that could determine pair-wise relationships using a statistical technique adopted from analysis of gene co-expression networks.

===Dissociation in cognitive neuropsychology===
Cognitive Neuropsychology studies brain damaged patients and uses the patterns of selective impairment in order to make inferences on the underlying cognitive structure. [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|Dissociation]] between cognitive functions is taken to be evidence that these functions are independent. Theorists have identified several key assumptions that are needed to justify these inferences:&lt;ref&gt;Coltheart, M "Assumptions and Methods in Cognitive Neuropsychology" in The Handbook of Cognitive Neuropsychology. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
1) ''Functional Modularity''- the mind is organized into functionally separate cognitive modules.
2). ''Anatomical Modularity''- the brain is organized into functionally separate modules. This assumption is very similar to the assumption of functional localization. These assumptions differ from the assumption of functional modularity, because it is possible to have separable cognitive modules that are implemented by diffuse patterns of brain activation.
3)''Universality''- The basic organization of functional and anatomical modularity is the same for all normal humans. This assumption is needed if we are to make any claim about functional organization based on dissociation that extrapolates from the instance of a case study to the population.
4) ''Transparency'' / ''Subtractivity''- the mind does not undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage. It is possible to remove one functional module without significantly altering the overall structure of the system. This assumption is necessary in order to justify using brain damaged patients in order to make inferences about the cognitive architecture of healthy people.

There are three principal types of evidence in cognitive neuropsychology: association, single dissociation and double dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, K and Plaut, D (2009) "Shallow Droughts Intoxicate the Brain: Lessons from Cognitive Science for Cognitive Neuropsychology"&lt;/ref&gt; Association inferences observe that certain deficits are likely to co-occur. For example, there are many cases who have deficits in both abstract and concrete word comprehension following brain damage. Association studies are considered the weakest form of evidence, because the results could be accounted for by damage to neighboring brain regions and not damage to a single cognitive system.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M (2010) "Double Dissociation: Understanding its Role in Cognitive Neuropsychology" Mind &amp; Language vol 25 no 5 pp500-540&lt;/ref&gt; Single Dissociation inferences observe that one cognitive faculty can be spared while another can be damaged following brain damage. This pattern indicates that a) the two tasks employ different cognitive systems b) the two tasks occupy the same system and the damaged task is downstream from the spared task or c) that the spared task requires fewer cognitive resources than the damaged task. The "gold standard" for cognitive neuropsychology is the double dissociation. Double dissociation occurs when brain damage impairs task A in Patient1 but spares task B and brain damage spares task A in Patient 2 but damages task B. It is assumed that one instance of double dissociation is sufficient proof to infer separate cognitive modules in the performance of the tasks.

Many theorists criticize cognitive neuropsychology for its dependence on double dissociations. In one widely cited study, Joula and Plunkett used a model connectionist system to demonstrate that double dissociation behavioral patterns can occur through random lesions of a single module.&lt;ref&gt;Joula and Plunkett (1998)"Why Double Dissociations Don't Mean Much" Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society&lt;/ref&gt; They created a multilayer connectionist system trained to pronounce words. They repeatedly simulated random destruction of nodes and connections in the system and plotted the resulting performance on a scatter plot. The results showed deficits in irregular noun pronunciation with spared regular verb pronunciation in some cases and deficits in regular verb pronunciation with spared irregular noun pronunciation. These results suggest that a single instance of double dissociation is insufficient to justify inference to multiple systems.&lt;ref&gt;Keren, G and Schuly (2003) "Two is not Always Better than One: a Critical Evaluation of Two System Theories" Perspectives on Psychological Science Vol 4 no 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter offers a theoretical case in which double dissociation logic can be faulty.&lt;ref&gt;Charter, N (2003)"How Much Can We Learn From Double Dissociations" Cortex 39 pp.176–179&lt;/ref&gt; If two tasks, task A and task B, use almost all of the same systems but differ by one mutually exclusive module apiece, then the selective lesioning of those two modules would seem to indicate that A and B use different systems. Charter uses the example of someone who is allergic to peanuts but not shrimp and someone who is allergic to shrimp and not peanuts. He argues that double dissociation logic leads one to infer that peanuts and shrimp are digested by different systems. John Dunn offers another objection to double dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, J (2003) "The elusive Dissociation" Cortex 39 no 1 21–37&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that it is easy to demonstrate the existence of a true deficit but difficult to show that another function is truly spared. As more data is accumulated, the value of your results will converge on an effect size of zero, but there will always be a positive value greater than zero that has more statistical power than zero. Therefore, it is impossible to be fully confident that a given double dissociation actually exists.

On a different note, Alphonso Caramazza has given a principled reason for rejecting the use of group studies in cognitive neuropsychology.&lt;ref&gt;Caramazza, A (1986) "On Drawing Inferences about the Structure of Normal Cognitive Systems From the Analysis of Patterns of Impaired Performance: the Case for Single Case Studies"&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain damaged patients can either take the form of a single case study, in which an individual's behavior is characterized and used as evidence, or group studies, in which a group of patients displaying the same deficit have their behavior characterized and averaged. In order to justify grouping a set of patient data together, the researcher must know that the group is homogenous, that their behavior is equivalent in every theoretically meaningful way. In brain damaged patients, this can only be accomplished ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' by analyzing the behavior patterns of all the individuals in the group. Thus according to Caramazza, any group study is either the equivalent of a set of single case studies or is theoretically unjustified. Newcombe and Marshall pointed out that there are some cases (they use Geschwind's syndrome as an example) and that group studies might still serve as a useful heuristic in cognitive neuropsychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;Newcombe and Marshall (1988)"Idealization Meets Psychometrics. The case for the Right Groups and the Right Individuals" Human Cognitive Neuropsychology edited by Ellis and Young&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single unit recordings===
It is commonly understood in neuroscience that information is encoded in the brain by the firing patterns of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;deCharms and Zandor (2000) "Neural Representations and the Cortical Code" Annual Review of Neuroscience 23:613–647&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the philosophical questions surrounding the neural code are related to questions about representation and computation that are discussed below. There are other methodological questions including whether neurons represent information through an average firing rate or whether there is information represented by the temporal dynamics. There are similar questions about whether neurons represent information individually or as a population.

===Computational neuroscience===
Many of the philosophical controversies surrounding computational neuroscience involve the role of simulation and modeling as explanation. Carl Craver has been especially vocal about such interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Craver, Carl Explaining the Brain. Oxford University Press New York, New York. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Love wrote an especially critical article targeted at Bayesian behavioral modeling that did not constrain the modeling parameters by psychological or neurological considerations&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Love (2011) "Bayesian Fundemantalism or Enlightenment? on the explanatory status and theoretical contribution of Bayesian models of cognition" Brain and Behavioral Sciences vol 34 no 4&lt;/ref&gt;
Eric Winsberg has written about the role of computer modeling and simulation in science generally, but his characterization is applicable to computational neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;Winberg, E (2003)"Simulated Experiments: Methodology for a Virtual World" Philosophy of Science.vol 70 no 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computation and representation in the brain==
The [[computational theory of mind]] has been widespread in neuroscience since the cognitive revolution in the 1960s. This section will begin with a historical overview of computational neuroscience and then discuss various competing theories and controversies within the field.

===Historical overview===
Computational neuroscience began in the 1930s and 1940s with two groups of researchers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The first group consisted of [[Alan Turing]], [[Alonzo Church]] and [[John von Neumann]], who were working to develop computing machines and the mathematical underpinnings of [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Horst, Steven, "The Computational Theory of Mind", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/computational-mind/&lt;/ref&gt; This work culminated in the theoretical development of so-called Turing machines and the [[Church–Turing thesis]], which formalized the mathematics underlying computability theory. The second group consisted of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts who were working to develop the first artificial neural networks. McCulloch and Pitts were the first to hypothesize that neurons could be used to implement a logical calculus that could explain cognition. They used their toy neurons to develop logic gates that could make computations.&lt;ref&gt;Piccini, G (2009) "Computationalism in the Philosophy of Mind" Philosophical Compass vol 4&lt;/ref&gt; However these developments failed to take hold in the psychological sciences and neuroscience until the mid-1950s and 1960s.
Behaviorism had dominated the psychology until the 1950s when new developments in a variety of fields overturned behaviorist theory in favor of a cognitive theory. From the beginning of the cognitive revolution, computational theory played a major role in theoretical developments. Minsky and McCarthy's work in artificial intelligence, Newell and Simon's computer simulations, and Noam Chomsky's importation of information theory into linguistics were all heavily reliant on computational assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G (2003) "The Cognitive Revolution: a Historical Perspective" Trends in Cognitive Sciences. vol 7 no 3&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, Hilary Putnam was arguing in favor of machine functionalism in which the brain instantiated Turing machines. By this point computational theories were firmly fixed in psychology and neuroscience.
By the mid-1980s, a group of researchers began using multilayer feed-forward analog neural networks that could be trained to perform a variety of tasks. The work by researchers like Sejnowski, Rosenberg, Rumelhart, and McClelland were labeled as connectionism, and the discipline has continued since then.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, James, "Connectionism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/connectionism/&lt;/ref&gt; The connectionist mindset was embraced by Paul and Patricia Churchland who then developed their "state space semantics" using concepts from connectionist theory. Connectionism was also condemned by researchers such as Fodor, Pylyshyn, and Pinker. The tension between the connectionists and the classicists is still being debated today.

===Representation===
One of the reasons that computational theories are appealing is that computers have the ability to manipulate representations to give meaningful output. Digital computers use strings of 1s and 0s in order to represent the content such as this Wikipedia page. Most cognitive scientists posit that our brains use some form of representational code that is carried in the firing patterns of neurons. Computational accounts seem to offer an easy way of explaining how our brains carry and manipulate the perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and actions that make up our everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, David, "Mental Representation", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/mental-representation/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While most theorists maintain that representation is an important part of cognition, the exact nature of that representation is highly debated. The two main arguments come from advocates of symbolic representations and advocates of associationist representations.

Symbolic representational accounts have been famously championed by Fodor and Pinker. Symbolic representation means that the objects are represented by symbols and are processed through rule governed manipulations that are sensation to the constitutive structure. The fact that symbolic representation is sensitive to the structure of the representations is a major part of its appeal. Fodor proposed the Language of Thought Hypothesis in which mental representations manipulated in the same way that language is syntactically manipulated in order to produce thought. According to Fodor, the language of thought hypothesis explains the systematicity and productivity seen in both language and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Aydede, Murat, "The Language of Thought Hypothesis", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/language-thought/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Associativist representations are most often described with connectionist systems. In connectionist systems, representations are distributed across all the nodes and connection weights of the system and thus are said to be sub symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel and Abrahamsen. Connectionism and the Mind. 2nd ed. Malden, Mass. : Blackwell, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that a connectionist system is capable of implementing a symbolic system. There are several important aspects of neural nets that suggest that distributed parallel processing provides a better basis for cognitive functions than symbolic processing. Firstly, the inspiration for these systems came from the brain itself indicating biological relevance. Secondly, these systems are capable of storing content addressable memory, which is far more efficient than memory searches in symbolic systems. Thirdly, neural nets are resilient to damage while even minor damage can disable a symbolic system. Lastly, soft constraints and generalization when processing novel stimuli allow nets to behave more flexibly than symbolic systems.

The Churchlands described representation in a connectionist system in terms of state space. The content of the system is represented by an n-dimensional vector where the n= the number of nodes in the system and the direction of the vector is determined by the activation pattern of the nodes. Fodor rejected this method of representation on the grounds that two different connectionist systems could not have the same content.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, N. "Content and its Vehicles in Connectionist Systems" Mind and Language. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Further mathematical analysis of connectionist system relieved that connectionist systems that could contain similar content could be mapped graphically to reveal clusters of nodes that were important to representing the content.&lt;ref&gt;Laakso, Aarre &amp; Cottrell, Garrison W. (2000). Content and cluster analysis: Assessing representational similarity in neural systems. Philosophical Psychology 13 (1):47–76&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the Churchlands, state space vector comparison was not amenable to this type of analysis. Recently, Nicholas Shea has offered his own account for content within connectionist systems that employs the concepts developed through cluster analysis.

===Views on computation===
Computational neuroscience is committed to the position that the brain is some sort of computer, but what does it mean to be a computer? The definition of a computation must be narrow enough so that we limit the number of objects that can be called computers. For example, it might seem problematic to have a definition wide enough to allow stomachs and weather systems to be involved in computations. However, it is also necessary to have a definition broad enough to allow all of the wide varieties of computational systems to compute. For example, if the definition of computation is limited to syntactic manipulation of symbolic representations, then most connectionist systems would not be able to compute.&lt;ref&gt;Shagrir (2010)"Computation San Diego Style" Philosophy of science vol 77&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Grush distinguishes between computation as a tool for simulation and computation as a theoretical stance in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Grush"&gt;Grush, R (2001) "The semantic Challenge to Computational Neuroscience"In Peter K. Machamer, Peter McLaughlin &amp; Rick Grush (eds.), Theory and Method in the Neurosciences. University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For the former, anything that can be computationally modeled counts as computing. In the latter case, the brain is a computing function that is distinct from systems like fluid dynamic systems and the planetary orbits in this regard. The challenge for any computational definition is to keep the two senses distinct.

Alternatively, some theorists choose to accept a narrow or wide definition for theoretical reasons. [[Pancomputationalism]] is the position that everything can be said to compute. This view has been criticized by [[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini]] on the grounds that such a definition makes computation trivial to the point where it is robbed of its explanatory value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini, G]]. (2010). "The Mind as Neural Software? Understanding Functionalism, Computationalism, and Computational Functionalism." Philosophy and Phenomenological Research&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest definition of computations is that a system can be said to be computing when a computational description can be mapped onto the physical description. This is an extremely broad definition of computation and it ends up endorsing a form of pancomputationalism. Putnam and Searle, who are often credited with this view, maintain that computation is observer-related. In other words, if you want to view a system as computing then you can say that it is computing. Piccinini points out that, in this view, not only is everything computing, but also everything is computing in an indefinite number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini, G. (2010b). "The Mind as Neural Software? Understanding Functionalism, Computationalism, and Computational Functionalism." Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 81&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is possible to apply an indefinite number of computational descriptions to a given system, the system ends up computing an indefinite number of tasks.

The most common view of computation is the semantic account of computation. Semantic approaches use a similar notion of computation as the mapping approaches with the added constraint that the system must manipulate representations with semantic content. Note from the earlier discussion of representation that both the Churchlands' connectionist systems and Fodor's symbolic systems use this notion of computation. In fact, Fodor is famously credited as saying "No computation without representation".&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini, G (2009) "Computation in the Philosophy of Mind" Philosophical Compass. vol 4&lt;/ref&gt; Computational states can be individuated by an externalized appeal to content in a broad sense (i.e. the object in the external world) or by internalist appeal to the narrow sense content (content defined by the properties of the system).&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Piccinini, Gualtiero, "Computation in Physical Systems", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/computation-physicalsystems/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to fix the content of the representation, it is often necessary to appeal to the information contained within the system.
Grush provides a criticism of the semantic account.&lt;ref name="Grush" /&gt; He points out that appeal to the informational content of a system to demonstrate representation by the system. He uses his coffee cup as an example of a system that contains information, such as the heat conductance of the coffee cup and the time since the coffee was poured, but is too mundane to compute in any robust sense. Semantic computationalists try to escape this criticism by appealing to the evolutionary history of system. This is called the biosemantic account. Grush uses the example of his feet, saying that by this account his feet would not be computing the amount of food he had eaten because their structure had not been evolutionarily selected for that purpose. Grush replies to the appeal to biosemantics with a thought experiment. Imagine that lightning strikes a swamp somewhere and creates an exact copy of you. According to the biosemantic account, this swamp-you would be incapable of computation because there is no evolutionary history with which to justify assigning representational content. The idea that for two physically identical structures one can be said to be computing while the other is not should be disturbing to any physicalist.

There are also syntactic or structural accounts for computation. These accounts do not need to rely on representation. However, it is possible to use both structure and representation as constrains on computational mapping. Shagrir identifies several philosophers of neuroscience who espouse structural accounts. According to him, Fodor and Pylyshyn require some sort of syntactic constraint on their theory of computation. This is consistent with their rejection of connectionist systems on the grounds of systematicity. He also identifies Piccinini as a structuralist quoting his 2008 paper: "the generation of output strings of digits from input strings of digits in accordance with a general rule that depends on the properties of the strings and (possibly) on the internal state of the system".&lt;ref&gt;Piccinini (2008)"Computation without Representation" Philosophical Studies vol 137 no 2&lt;/ref&gt; Though Piccinini undoubtedly espouses structuralist views in that paper, he claims that mechanistic accounts of computation avoid reference to either syntax or representation.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; It is possible that Piccinini thinks that there are differences between syntactic and structural accounts of computation that Shagrir does not respect.

In his view of mechanistic computation, Piccinini asserts that functional mechanisms process vehicles in a manner sensitive to the differences between different portions of the vehicle, and thus can be said to generically compute. He claims that these vehicles are medium-independent, meaning that the mapping function will be the same regardless of the physical implementation. Computing systems can be differentiated based upon the vehicle structure and the mechanistic perspective can account for errors in computation.

Dynamical systems theory presents itself as an alternative to computational explanations of cognition. These theories are staunchly anti-computational and anti-representational. Dynamical systems are defined as systems that change over time in accordance with a mathematical equation. Dynamical systems theory claims that human cognition is a dynamical model in the same sense computationalists claim that the human mind is a computer.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. J. (1998) The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 21, 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; A common objection leveled at dynamical systems theory is that dynamical systems are computable and therefore a subset of computationalism. Van Gelder is quick to point out that there is a big difference between being a computer and being computable. Making the definition of computing wide enough to incorporate dynamical models would effectively embrace pancomputationalism.

'''One World Archaeology''' is a book series focussing on archaeology and education about the past. 

==About the Series==
One World Archaeology is one of five book series associated with the [[World Archaeological Congress]] (WAC). Editors and contributors to these series waive any royalties, allowing all royalties to be used to further the work of the WAC. "Publications in the One World Archaeology series contain selections of the papers presented at the WAC Congresses, held every four years. This series developed as an outcome of the inaugural World Archaeological Congress held in Southampton, England in 1986. The subject matter of this series is wide-ranging, reflecting the diverse interests of WAC. WAC gives place to considerations of power and politics in framing archaeological questions and results. WAC also gives place and privilege to minorities who have often been silenced or regarded as beyond capable of making main line contributions to the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldarch.org/publications/|title=Publications|date=23 May 2015|website=worldarch.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paleoradiology''' (ancient radiology) is the study of [[archeology|archaeological]] remains through the use of [[Radiography|radiographic]] techniques, such as [[X-ray]], [[CT scan|CT]] (computer tomography) and [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] scans.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy|date=2004|title=Paleoradiology: current status and future challenges|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235996145?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|pages=198–199|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predominately used by archaeologists and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] to examine [[mummy|mummified]] remains due to its non-invasive nature.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Paleoradiologists can discover post-mortem damage to the body, or any artefacts buried with them, while still keeping the remains intact. Radiological images can also contribute evidence about the person's life, such as their age and cause of death. The first recorded use of paleoradiology (although not by that name) was in 1896, just a year after the Rōntgen radiograph was first produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although this method of viewing ancient remains is advantageous due to its non-invasive manner, many radiologists lack expertise in archeology and very few radiologists can identify ancient diseases which may be present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== CT ===
{{Main|CT scan}}
CT scans are most commonly used in paleoradiological studies because they can create images of soft tissue, organs and body cavities of mummified remains without performing an invasive and damaging autopsy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Heidi|last2=Torres|first2=William E.|last3=Ernst|first3=Randy D.|date=2002|title=Paleoradiology: Advanced CT in the Evaluation of Nine Egyptian Mummies|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=377–385|doi=10.1148/radiographics.22.2.g02mr13377|pmid=11896227|issn=0271-5333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally unwrap the remains and reveal what they contain. CT scanners create these images by taking multiple radiographic planes (or cuts) of the body at different angles which records the layers of different structures in the remains. This differs from typical [[Radiography|radiographic scans]] (X-rays) where all the structural layers are documented in one image, which can create shadows and therefore limit their accuracy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brothwell|first=D|last2=Chhem|first2=R|date=2008|title=Paleoradiology Imaging Mummies and Fossils|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0.pdf|journal=|publisher=Springer|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0|via=|isbn=978-3-540-48832-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are several main viewing techniques used in CT imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/neuroradiology/image-acquisition/the-basics|title=The Basics - Neuroradiology|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=2018|website=sites.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Axial Imaging: images that are taken from transverse planes, cutting across the body. This provides information about the chest, abdomen and pelvic area of the body, as well as the cranium.
* Sagittal Imaging: images taken from the left or right sides of the body. This gives a greater indication of the length of fractures found on the remains. Together with axial imaging it can create a greater depth of visual understanding of the interior of the body.
* Coronal Imaging: images are taken from the back to the front of the body. This can provide a more accurate indication of the presence of organs in the chest cavity (e.g. the heart).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Wormian Inca bone.png|thumb|A 3D image of the skull of an Incan mummy]]
After these different views of the remains have been obtained, it is possible to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the body. This brings into focus details which may have been missed on the axial imagining. [[Algorithm]] manipulation is used to create the rotational 3D images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In paleoradiology, the 3D images provide a greater understanding of the remains themselves. For example, in 2002, a study of nine Egyptian mummies found that by using the 3D reconstructions they could see the preservation of soft tissues, such as the penis on one male body and braided hair on female remains. The 3D modelling also illustrated discrepancies between the remains, as some had their internal organs removed while others had not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Due to their ability to take multiple planes of the remains, CT scans are able to virtually 'fly through' the body to assess internal composition and cavities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cosmacini|first=P|last2=Piacentini|first2=P|date=2008|title=Notes on the history of the radiological study of Egyptian mummies: from X-rays to new imaging techniques|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7.pdf|journal=La Radiologia Medica|volume=113|issue=5|pages=615–626|doi=10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7|pmid=18523844|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are commonly used for diagnostic scans such as [[colonoscopy]] and [[bronchoscopy]], and the same method is applied to ancient remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This enables researchers to digitally look through the remains from the top down, as though they were watching a short video of footage from the interior of the body. The technique presents observable data from the hollow cavities in the chest and abdomen regions. It can demonstrate whether there are internal organs present or if, in the case of Egyptian mummies, linen has been packed to maintain the body shape of the remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Micro-CT ====
{{Main|Micro-CT}}Micro-CT is a specialised form of CT scan used to create images with pixels in micrometres. These images are frequently used for bone density examinations and produce greater detail for images of bony structures. This radiology technique is often used to examine the teeth from mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy K.|date=2006-06-08|title=Paleoradiology: imaging disease in mummies and ancient skeletons|journal=Skeletal Radiology|volume=35|issue=11|pages=803–804|doi=10.1007/s00256-006-0144-y|pmid=16847646|issn=0364-2348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early use (1895&amp;ndash;1970)==
[[File:Mummified cats.jpg|thumb|Two mummified Egyptian cats with a radiograph of the cat on the left|alt=]]
Radiographs, or X-rays, have been used to study and observe ancient remains since their invention by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in 1895. This early form of X-ray, sometimes known as Röntgenograms, was immediately used by physicists, anthropologists, anatomists and archaeologists as shown below.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=History of paleoradiology: early published literature, 1896-1921|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235982587/fulltext/E876D2B50A9948B1PQ/1?accountid=14757|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=203–210|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* 1896; Carl Georg Walter Koenig, a German physicist, took images of an Egyptian child mummy as well as an Egyptian mummified cat. Fourteen images were taken using a very early form of X-ray, which Koenig realised could be used for more than just medical purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Ronald G.|date=2014-02-28|title=Paleoimaging: a review of applications and challenges|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=3|pages=423–436|doi=10.1007/s12024-014-9541-z|pmid=24682794|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1897; [[Albert Londe]], a French physicist, took radiographic images of an Egyptian mummy. From these images he was able to determine the presence of artefacts placed in the mummy's wrappings, such as decorative jewellery on the body (e.g. rings), as well as the approximate bone age of the remains by examining the growth plates. Londe’s thorough examination of the pictures demonstrated how ancient remains could be studied without damaging the wrappings and body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* 1898; Charles Lester Leonard and Stewart Culin conducted a radiographic examination of a [[Moche culture|Mochica mummy]] (Peruvian mummy). The mummy had been tightly wrapped and was left unopened to preserve its integrity. Leonard determined that the body was of a child who had been decorated in beads before burial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1901&amp;ndash;1902; [[Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger|Karl Gorjanovic-Kramberger]] took images of Palaeolithic skeletons found in Croatia. By comparing the X-rays of the jaw of these remains with X-rays from a modern man he was able to determine differences between the two. The X-ray of the Palaeolithic jaw was also used to measure the length of the teeth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Tutankhamunxray.jpg|thumb|An X-ray of Tutankhamun's skull, the arrow pointing to a possible cause of death]]

* 1905; [[Heinrich Albers-Schönberg|Heinrich Ernst Albers-Schoenberg]] used the radiological method to examine an Egyptian mummy. He discovered that there was a substance in the thorax and pelvis which had most likely been placed there for mummification purposes. He was also able to determine the perseveration of soft tissues around the nose and mouth as well as details within the skull and the state of the spine, which was wholly intact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1912; [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Sir Grafton Elliot Smith]] examined the mummy of Egyptian pharaoh [[Thutmose IV|Thutmosis IV]] and was able to suggest an approximate bone age from these images. He recommended in his publication on the mummy that the use of radiology would be able to provide greater detail to the study of the remains in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* 1921; F. Salomon studied a Peruvian mummy using X-rays, determining the bone age and the bone structure of the remains. He discovered that the remains were of a child around 2&amp;ndash;3 years old, and bone structure was at a normal developmental stage for this age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*1933; X-ray imaging was used on Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]] by Douglas Derry to discover the age of death. It was approximated to be 40&amp;ndash;50 based on the wear and condition of the teeth. Derry also noted post-mortem damage to the body, which has been attributed to grave robbers, as well as amulets and beads used to decorate the remains during mummification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*1968; A portable X-ray machine was used to examine the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]] in his tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] by researcher R. G. Harrison. These images indicated an age of death of around 18&amp;ndash;20 years based on bone age from a study of the limb lengths, as well as tooth analysis. The rumoured cause of death of tuberculosis was also ruled out during this study. A new hypothesis was formed that Tutankhamun died because of blunt force trauma to the head, due to a depressed fracture found on the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Current use in archaeology ==
CT scans are the most common radiological technique used in modern archaeology due to their ability to provide more detailed information about ancient remains (such as soft tissue and blood vessels) and to produce 3D images by taking layers of different angled pictures. Archaeologists are able to collect data such as age, sex, the cause of death, socioeconomic status, mummification and burial practices by analysing the CT images. The images can also reveal whether the remains were subject to ancient diseases or post-mortem damage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although paleoradiology practices are used on preserved remains such as European [[Bog body|bog bodies]] and frozen bodies from the High Andes, they are more frequently documented in the analysis of Egyptian mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=Diagnostic paleoradiology of mummified tissue: interpretation and pitfalls|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/236112998?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=218–227|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptology ===
[[File:Statue Paramesses Munich.JPG|thumb|Statue of Paramesses (later known as Ramesses I), pharaoh of Egypt during the 20th dynasty of New Kingdom Egypt]]
CT scans are used in [[Egyptology]] to gain insight into mummified bodies without risking damage to the integrity of the remains. Hoffman's recent study of nine Egyptian remains discovered new information regarding the mummification practices of Egyptians. The typical process of [[Mummification in Ancient Egypt|mummification]], as written by [[Herodotus]], involves the removal of the four major internal organs (liver, intestines, lungs and stomach) and placement of them in four [[Canopic jar|canopic jars]]. The heart is removed, embalmed and placed back into the body as it is an important feature in the journey to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian afterlife]]. However, Hoffman discovered that this was not the case in all mummies. Through analysis of CT-produced 3D images, the "fly-through" technique and a combination of axial and coronal images, it was discovered that four of the remains had not had their internal organs removed and in another four the heart could not be identified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hoffman suggests this may be due to socioeconomic differences between the mummies during the time they were alive. CT scans were further used in Hoffman's study to potentially identify one of the remains as [[Ramesses I]], a Pharaoh during [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom Egypt]]. It was found that the mummification practices of this particular body were in conjunction with those typically used during the New Kingdom period, as images showed rolled linen placed inside the body in order to preserve its shape. The mummy's arms were also found to be placed across the chest as a symbol of nobility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imaging done by Rethy Chhem, in 2004, was able to correct a diagnosis of Ramesses II from X-rays done in 1976. The incorrect diagnosis had been of [[ankylosing spondylitis]], a form of arthritis. However, Chhem perceived that the pharaoh actually had [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]], a calcification of the joints causing ligaments to attach to the spine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The CT images provided a clearer and more detailed image of the spine when compared with the early X-rays. This enabled the researchers to provide a greater insight into diseases found in ancient remains and achieve a more accurate diagnosis. 

A recent CT scan of Tutankhamun in 2006 was able to provide evidence against the 'homicide theory'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A depression fracture noted on the skull from X-rays taken 30 years previously was found to be a post-mortem injury rather than a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hole in the head had been created in order to continue the embalming process of mummification.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This CT investigation was also able to confirm Tutankhamun's age of death as nineteen and disprove the idea that the young pharaoh had suffered from [[scoliosis]]; rather the bend in his spine was from additional post-mortem damage to the body.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

== Disadvantages ==
Although the information and evidence gathered by radiological imaging of ancient remains have been largely beneficial to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, not all of the information can be considered accurate due to the lack of radiologists who specialise in [[paleopathology]]. Instead, to obtain the most information from CT or X-ray images a team must meet to discuss the findings (e.g. for a skeletal study of the remains, an orthopaedic surgeon, bone pathologist and musculoskeletal radiologist would meet).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another disadvantage to this technique is the low contrast resolution. The researcher may be unable to determine a difference between soft tissue and artefacts left from the embalming process. Due to the decomposed state of some of the mummified remains, it can also be difficult to distinguish internal organs due to shrinkage and a lack of preservation. Post-mortem injuries and damage to the body can also hinder the ability of radiological scans to provide accurate information for researchers. For example, in frozen remains, there can difficulty when differentiating whether a CT suggests the body has air-inflated lung tissue or if there is frozen fluid in the lungs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

Paleoradiology is informative in its ability to assist in determining the age of death of the remains, however, this is not always completely accurate or available information. In a sample of bog bodies, 35% were not able to be identified with any age group and 30% could not be sex determined. A radiological study of an iceman was only able to produce an estimate of 40&amp;ndash;50 years at age of death. In order to achieve a more accurate time frame, the body would have to be subject to an autopsy or similar physical assessment which would cause irreversible damage to the remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another disadvantage of paleoradiology is the difficulty in transporting the equipment or the artefact/remains to spaces where the images can be taken.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eppenberger|first=Patrick E.|last2=Cavka|first2=Mislav|last3=Habicht|first3=Michael E.|last4=Galassi|first4=Francesco M.|last5=Rühli|first5=Frank|date=2018-06-20|title=Radiological findings in ancient Egyptian canopic jars: comparing three standard clinical imaging modalities (x-rays, CT and MRI)|journal=European Radiology Experimental|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/s41747-018-0048-3|issn=2509-9280|pmc=6008346|pmid=29951641}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2005 the mummy of Tutankhamun was imaged using a CT-scanner which had to be brought from the [[Cairo Museum]] to [[tomb KV62]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|date=2013|title=The Death of Tutankhamun|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/1469896500?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:summon&amp;accountid=14757|journal=International Journal on Humanistic Ideology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=13–27|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fragile state of the remains which were unable to be removed from the climate-controlled tomb. In this study, funding came from  a five-year grant from the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], which was aided by the donation of a Siemens CT-scanner by the [[National Geographic Society]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; however typically funding for research can be problematic as equipment is costly and there may not be sufficient interest to prompt donations.

Pancar Merah is made by a skilled person with a high spiritual level, usually a kyai (ulama, sheikh), and it is crafted only in certain times or periods before or after praying or fasting.

The most notable pieces of Pancar Merah were made in desa (village) Dalam Pagar near [[Martapura, South Kalimantan]], Indonesia before World War II.

'''Paul Henry Lang''' (August 28, 1901 in [[Budapest]] – September 21, 1991 in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]] [[musicologist]] and [[music critic]].

Lang was born in Budapest, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and was educated in Catholic schools. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army though he had not completed school, and sent to the Italian front.&lt;ref&gt;As told by PHL to family&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, he had to make his own way home, and then studied at the University of Budapest and the [[Budapest Music Academy]], under [[Zoltán Kodály]] and Erno Dohnanyi, among others. Kodály, learning that he only played piano, assigned him to learn to play the bassoon. After graduating in 1922, he was an assistant conductor at the Budapest Opera, but was encouraged to study musicology by Kodály and [[Béla Bartók]]. At that time serious study in musicology was only available in France and Germany. He began at the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he attended classes in philosophy and literature as well. He was not happy in Germany and moved on to the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, where he studied with Andre Pirro. In the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] Lang participated as part of the French National rowing team. He supported himself by playing bassoon in various orchestras and also conducted an emigrant Hungarian chorus. While a student in Paris he began his career as a music critic, writing for the ''[[Revue Musicale]]''. He completed his dissertation on French lute music, but was not awarded his doctoral degree because he could not afford the large sum needed to engrave the unpublished scores he was discussing and print the dissertation, as required by the university.&lt;ref&gt;PHL oral history, 1981, at Columbia University Center for Oral History&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, knowing no English,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Paul Henry Lang's wife, Anne Pecheux Lang, in letter to the ''New York Review of Books'', http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/paul-henry-lang/. Retrieved July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lang moved to the United States as a junior scholar of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He took a few English classes and then picked up more from motion pictures. He taught music, including harmony and counterpoint, for a year at [[Vassar College]] (1930–31), filling in for a professor on sabbatical. Then at [[Wells College]] (1932–34), he taught music history and analysis and led the chapel choir. At the same time he worked on a dissertation on the literary history of French opera,earning a [[doctorate degree]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1934. Having by now published a few articles in English, he was invited to teach at both Wellesley College and Columbia. For one year he taught at both colleges. Mr. Lang joined the music faculty of Columbia University in 1934 with the first professorship of musicology in America,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pecheux Lang letter,&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly began changing the way music was taught there by adding courses, such as the esthetics of music, and by expanding the musicology department. In 1940, after Bartók fled Hungary during [[World War II]], Lang arranged for Columbia to hire him as an ethnomusicologist. As musicology was a nascent field at the time, Lang had a strong influence on its development, especially in the United States, and advised a number of students who would go on to become prominent musicologists, including [[James McKinnon]], [[Dika Newlin]], [[Joel Sachs]], [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]], [[Richard Taruskin]], [[Piero Weiss]], and [[Neal Zaslaw]].

Lang became best known for his often provocative articles and books on both contemporary trends in music and music history. He was from 1954 to 1964 the music critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', succeeding [[Virgil Thomson]], and was editor of ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' from 1945 to 1973. He published a number of books, the most famous of which is ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'' (1941), called "[a] model of scholarship and style"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Age of Faith|last = Durant|first = Will|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 1950|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Will Durant]]. He was an adviser to his publisher, W.W. Norton, and edited several books for them. He was a founding member of the American Musicological Society and in 1955 was elected for a term as president of the International Musicological Society.

In addition to his most famous work,  ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'', Lang wrote  ''George Frideric Handel, '' collaborated with Otto Bettmann on ''A Pictorial History of Music,'' and edited several compilations, including  ''The Creative World of Mozart'' and  ''One Hundred Years of Music in America.''

In 1936 he married Anne Pecheux, a Barnard graduate who had taken his undergraduate music history course.  They had four children.

'''''Picasso &amp; Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey''''' ({{ISBN|0821258109}}) is a book by [[David Douglas Duncan]] that features professional photographs of [[Pablo Picasso]] and his [[dachshund]], [[Lump (dog)|Lump]]. The book, published in 2006 by Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, gives an insight into Picasso's later life, and Picasso - the man, not the image. The book contrasts black-and-white photos of Picasso, his wife Jacqueline and Lump with Picasso's colourful [[Las Meninas (Picasso)|interpretations]] of painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (that happen to feature Lump). ''Picasso &amp; Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey'' is a [[coffee table book]] that brings to light the story of a lucky dog who became a loved pet and an icon of [[modern art]].

The book is alternatively known as, '''''Lump: The Dog Who Ate a Picasso'''''.

'''''Show Me!''''' is a [[sex education]] book by photographer [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride]]. It appeared in 1974 in German under the title ''Zeig Mal!'', written with [[psychiatrist]] Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt for children and their parents. It was translated into English a year later and was widely available in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic for many years, but later became subject to expanded [[child pornography]] laws in jurisdictions including the United States. In Germany, the book was followed in 1990 by a second edition that included, among other additions, a discussion of the [[AIDS]] epidemic.

==Publication history==
While many parents appreciated ''Show Me!'' for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their [[Child sexuality|sexuality]], others called it [[child pornography]]. In 1975 and 1976, [[obscenity]] charges were brought against the publisher by prosecutors in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. In all four cases, the judges ruled as a matter of law that the title was not [[obscene]].

However, starting in 1977, some states began to criminalize the distribution of even ''non-obscene'' so-called "child pornography," or "images of abuse," which arguably is not protected by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment.]] [[New York (state)|New York]] State, home of the publisher, [[St. Martin's Press]], criminalized the distribution of non-obscene "child pornography" in 1977, but the publisher promptly went to court and obtained an [[injunction]] against the State.  The court granted the injunction because the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was interpreted to permit the banning of only obscene material.

In 1982, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] issued a decision, ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=458&amp;invol=747 New York v. Ferber], Findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the government to constitutionally ban the knowing distribution of even non-obscene "child pornography". Citing a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]], St. Martin's Press then pulled the book, stating that though they believed  ''Show Me!'' was not [[pornographic]], they could no longer afford the legal expenses to defend it, and they did not want to risk criminal prosecutions of their own personnel and/or vendors who sold the book.    The Court overruled a decision of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''The People  v. Paul Ira Ferber''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15562951158866016402], which held that  [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment]] protected the dissemination of non-obscene sexual depictions. ''Show Me!'' was not the direct subject of the ''Ferber'' case, but the book was prominently featured by both sides in the litigation, and it played a significant role in the [[oral argument]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1981/1981_81_55/argument/ Oral argument] at Oyez.org. Accessed 23 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In its country of origin, Germany, the book first won several awards, even from church organisations, but due to rising pressure from a newly arising "moral majority" the publishers and McBride decided to take it off the market in 1996. By then over one million copies in seven languages had been sold. It was never officially banned in Germany. Public libraries there keep it on hand and out of print copies are openly sold at collectors' premium prices.

In New Zealand the book was banned by the [[Indecent Publications Tribunal]] in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Censorship Database|url=http://www.censorship.govt.nz/DDA/Pages/Screens/DDA/WelcomePage.aspx|publisher=Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification. 1976 Publication No. IPT 76-860.  1996 Publication No. 9400964|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Show Me!'' received mixed reviews from the mass media when it was first published. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the photographs "beautiful...graceful, charming, and elegant," yet accurately predicted, in a severe understatement of what actually happened, that the book "may start (an) uproar."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/656022932.html?dids=656022932:656022932&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+9%2C+1975&amp;author=ROBERT+A+JONES&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=F6&amp;desc=IS+AMERICA+READY%3F Is America Ready?]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 9, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', on the other hand, described the photographs as "beautiful, assaultive, grotesque, and seductive," and concluded that ''Show Me!'' was only suited for "avant garde" parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120123914.html?dids=120123914:120123914&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;fmac=&amp;date=May+4%2C+1975&amp;author=By+T.+BERRY+BRAZELTON&amp;desc=Kiss+the+Stork+Goodbye "Kiss the Stork Goodbye]," ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Linda Wolfe was more hostile in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', calling the book a "child-abusive joke."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/the-birds-and-the-bees-were-never-like-this-show-me.html The birds and the bees were never like this]", ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' July 13, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 13-year-old daughter of [[Chicago Tribune]] reviewer Carol Kleiman commented:

::"I'm too old for it myself. The last part, though, with no pictures, looks interesting to read. The book is good for little kids because they don't know what society terms 'dirty' yet. You know, Mom, it's PARENTS I'm worried about. '''''They're''''' not ready yet."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/639825622.html?dids=639825622:639825622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+5%2C+1975&amp;author=Carol+Kleiman&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(1963-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=S11&amp;desc=New+sex+ed%3A+All+kids+ever+wanted+to+know...and+how!  New sex ed: All kids ever wanted to know...and how!]", ''Chicago Tribune'', July 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent reviews===
A 2005 Amazon review by Dr. [[Russell A. Rohde]] claims that the book, "appropriately delves into the issues of breast feeding, adolescence, pubertal changes, menses, sexual anatomies, pregnancy, masturbation, contraception, sexual behavioral disturbances and venereal disease. [...] I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Me-Picture-Children-Parents/dp/0312722753|author=Russell A. Rohde MD|quote=5.0 out of 5 stars|title="Show Me!"...unique, explicit &amp; sadly controversial...|date=February 17, 2005|publisher=Amazon.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. F. Janssen]] places it at the one extreme of a late 20th-century visual and textual revolution that enabled parents to illustrate information that up to that time had been transmitted orally. He sees the work as subversive not for its "too frank" portrayal of childhood sexuality, but instead for the primacy that the image takes over the text. In his eyes, the work "comes out of a culture with a long history of pathologising so-addressed '[[primal scene]]s,'" a history that became manifest in particular with regard to the works of Will McBride.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Janssen, ''[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/GUSVOLIICH18.HTM#_Toc70961575 Growing Up Sexually. Volume II: The Sexual Curriculum: The Manufacture and Performance of Pre-Adult Sexualities]'' (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is also analyzed in an article on "Picturing Sex Education" (Discourse Volume 27, Number 4 / December 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24745">{{sexual orientation}}
'''Sociosexual orientation''', or '''sociosexuality''', is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a more ''restricted'' sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more ''unrestricted'' sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gangestad | first2 = S.W. | year = 1991 | title = Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 870–883 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.6.870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{Main|Sociosexual Orientation Inventory}}
The revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) was designed to measure sociosexuality, with high SOI scores corresponding to an unrestricted orientation and low SOI scores denoting a more restricted orientation. The SOI-R also allows for the separate assessment of three facets of sociosexuality: behavior, attitude and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penke | first1 = L. | last2 = Asendorpf | first2 = J. B. | year = 2008 | title = Beyond global sociosexual orientations: A more differentiated look at sociosexuality and its effects on courtship and romantic relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 5| pages = 1113–1135 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.5.1113 | pmid=18954197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences and sexual orientation==
Men tend to have higher SOI scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D. P. | year = 2005 | title = Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 247–311 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000051 | pmid=16201459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D.

W. | last2 = Simpson | first2 = J. A. | year = 2000 | title = The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 573–587 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x0000337x | pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] women are significantly less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both [[lesbian]] and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women. Bisexual women are also the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by lesbians and then, heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt; [[Homosexuality|Gay]] and bisexual men are similar to heterosexual men in sociosexual attitudes, in that they express relatively unrestricted attitudes relative to women. However, gay men are the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by bisexual men and then, heterosexual men. This may be because gay men have more potential mating partners who prefer short-term, casual sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt;

Unrestricted sociosexuality is associated with early life experiences with sex, more frequent [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and a greater number of lifetime sex partners.  Unrestricted men tend to have greater [[rape myth]] acceptance, past sexual aggression and more conservative attitudes about women than restricted men. Unrestricted women tend to have more sexual fantasies involving having power or control over another person and lower levels of sexual conservatism than restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yost | first1 = M.

==Individual differences==

Individuals with an intrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as an end) tend to be sociosexually restricted, while those with an [[extrinsic religious orientation]] (i.e., religion as a mean to achieve non-religious goals) tend to be unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowatt | first1 = W.C. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = D.P. | year = 2003 | title = Associations between religious orientation and varieties of sexual experience | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 455–465 | doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mating tendencies==

===Motives===
Unrestricted women are more motivated to engage in casual sex than restricted women as they perceive more benefits associated with short-term mating. These include sexual benefits (e.g., experiencing the novelty of a new partner), resource benefits (e.g., receiving expensive gifts) and the improvement of their seduction skills. Sociosexuality is not associated with short-term benefits for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greiling | first1 = H. | last2 = Buss | first2 = D. M. | year = 2000 | title = Women's sexual strategies: The hidden dimension of extra-pair mating | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 929–963 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewing attractive female models, unrestricted men are more interested in the models’ [[physical attractiveness]], while restricted men show more interest in the social traits presumably possessed by attractive females. Unrestricted women report more interest in attractive male models’ popularity and are less interested in their willingness to commit, compared to restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Townsend | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Wasserman | first2 = T. | year = 1998 | title = Sexual attractiveness: Sex differences in assessment and criteria | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 171–191 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mate preferences===

Individuals are able to accurately assess the sociosexual orientation of computer-generated and real faces, with unrestricted sociosexuality being associated with greater attractiveness in female faces and greater masculinity in male faces. Women tend to prefer male faces associated with restricted sociosexuality, while men prefer unrestricted female faces, both for short-term and long-term partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boothroyd | first1 = L.

===Relationship interactions===
Unrestricted women report engaging in more social interactions with men on a daily basis than restricted women. However, unrestricted individuals rate their interactions with their best friends (non-romantic) as lower in quality (i.e., as less pleasant and satisfying) than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hebl | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Kashy | first2 = D. A. | year = 1995 | title = Sociosexuality and everyday social interaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 371–383 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to view cheating or [[infidelity]] as acceptable under certain conditions (e.g., when involved in a bad relationship), and report engaging in more cheating than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Cauffman | first2 = E. | year = 1999 | title = Your cheatin' heart: Attitudes, behaviors, and correlates of sexual betrayal in late adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–252 | doi=10.1207/s15327795jra0903_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity is mediated by commitment, meaning unrestricted individuals may cheat because they are less committed to their partner than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattingly | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Clark | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Weidler | first3 = D. J. | last4 = Bullock | first4 = M. | last5 = Hackathorn | first5 = J. | last6 = Blankmeyer | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Sociosexual orientation, commitment, and infidelity: A mediation analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 151 | issue = 3| pages = 222–226 | doi=10.1080/00224540903536162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormones==
Individuals who are partnered typically have lower [[testosterone]] levels than individuals who are single. However, this was found to apply solely to individuals possessing a restricted sociosexual orientation. Partnered, unrestricted men and women’s testosterone levels are more similar to the levels of single men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edelsteinlab.psych.lsa.umich.edu/pubs/Edelstein%20et%20al%202011%20HB.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Edelstein|first1=R.S.|last2=Chopik|first2=W.J.|last3=Kean|first3=E.L.|year=2011|title=Sociosexuality moderates the association between testosterone and relationship status in men and women|work=Hormones and Behavior|volume=60 |pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
In regions that suffer from a high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s, both men and women report lower levels of sociosexuality, as the costs of an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaller | first1 = M. | last2 = Murray | first2 = D. R. | year = 2008 | title = Pathogens, personality and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 212–221 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 | pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Possessing an unrestricted sociosexual orientation seems to increase the likelihood of having a son by 12-19% in American samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S. | last2 = Apari | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Sociosexually unrestricted parents have more sons: A further application of the generalized Trivers-Willard hypothesis (gTWH) | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 320–330 | doi=10.1080/03014460902766918}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by the generalized [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis|Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], which states that parents who possess any heritable trait that increases males’ reproductive success above females’  will have more sons, and will have more daughters if they possess traits that increase females’ reproductive success above males’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S | year = 2005 | title = Big and tall parents have more sons: Further generalizations of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 235 | issue = 4| pages = 583–590 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since unrestricted sociosexuality increases the reproductive fitness of sons more than daughters (as males have the potential to have more offspring through casual sex), unrestricted parents have a higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more sons).

==Relevant theories==

===Parental investment theory===
According to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation).&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Eds.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871-1971. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; In a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. Thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. Men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. Thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.

===Sex ratio theory===
[[Operational sex ratio]] is the number of sexually competing males versus the number of sexually competing females in the local mating pool.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"/&gt; High sex ratios indicate that there are more men than women available, while low sex ratios imply more women than men are sexually available. High sex ratios (more men) are associated with lower SOI scores (more restricted sociosexual orientation), as men must satisfy women’s preference for long-term [[Monogamy|monogamous]] relationships if they are to effectively compete for the limited number of women. Low sex ratios (more women) are correlated with more unrestricted sociosexuality, as men can afford to demand more casual sex if they are relatively scarce and in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = F. A. | year = 1991 | title = Secular trends in human sex ratios: Their influence on individual and family behavior | url = | journal = Human Nature | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 271–291 | doi=10.1007/bf02692189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic pluralism theory===
{{Main|Strategic pluralism}}Strategic pluralism suggests that women evolved to evaluate men on two dimensions: their potential to be a good provider for offspring and their degree of genetic quality. The local environment should have influenced which mate characteristics were preferred by women. In demanding environments where biparental care was critical to infant survival, women should have valued good parenting qualities more, leading men to adopt a more restricted sociosexual orientation and invest more in their offspring to help ensure their children survive. In disease-prevalent environments, good genes that would help offspring resist [[pathogen]]s should have been prioritized by women, leading healthy men to be more sociosexually unrestricted in order to pass on their genes to many offspring.&lt;ref name="Gangestad" /&gt;

===Social structural theory===
According to social structural theory, the division of labor and social expectations lead to gender differences in sociosexuality. In cultures with more traditional gender roles (where women have less freedom than men), gender differences in sociosexual orientation are larger. In these societies, where women have less access to power and money than men, it is expected that women should be more sexually restricted and only have sexual relations with men in the context of a committed relationship, whereas men may be sexually unrestricted if they wish. In more egalitarian societies, where men and women have equal access to power and money, the gender difference in sociosexuality is less pronounced, as individuals may take on the social role of the other gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

'''''The Banquet of Cleopatra''''' is the title of several works showing the culmination of a wager between [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] as to which one could provide the most expensive feast. As recounted in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny the Elder's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' she wins the wager: after Mark Antony's feast, Cleopatra drops a rare and precious pearl from her earring into a cup of vinegar and drinks it once the pearl has dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman B.L., [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/journals/CJ/52/5/Cleopatras_Pearls*.html "Cleopatra's Pearls"], web reprint of article from ''[[The Classical Journal]]'', Vol. 52, No. 5 (Feb. 1957), 193‑201&lt;/ref&gt;  The third person at the table is [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], at the time Antony's ally, who was to decide the winner of the wager.&lt;ref name="Christiansen, 152"&gt;Christiansen, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notable is the [[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Tiepolo)|treatment by Tiepolo]], though the subject was also painted by various artists, especially in Italian palace decoration and in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]], with [[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Jordaens)|a version by Jacob Jordaens]] (1653, [[Hermitage Museum]]); one by [[Gérard de Lairesse]] (late 1670s, [[Rijksmuseum]]); two versions by [[Jan de Bray]], using his own family, including himself, as models ([[Royal Collection]], 1652, and [[Currier Museum of Art]], [[New Hampshire]], 1669).  In between the two versions most of those depicted had died in an outbreak of plague, making the later version largely a memorial portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Lloyd (art historian)|Christopher Lloyd]], ''Enchanting the Eye, Dutch Paintings of the Golden Age'', pp. 49–52, Royal Collection Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|1-902163-90-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists included [[Gerard Hoet]], who painted three versions of the subject in the early 18th century (two are in the [[Getty Center]] and [[Bayreuth]], Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=563 "The Banquet of Cleopatra"], J Paul Getty Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the Italian and northern traditions the subject fitted well into existing genres showing lavish dining, with the added attraction of making a more prestigious [[history painting]] with an impeccable and exotic classical origin.  It often formed part of cycles on Antony and Cleopatra with other subjects including the ''Meeting of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony'', the ''Death of Cleopatra'', and sometimes her meetings with [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian]].

'''The College at Southeastern''' (abbreviated "C@SE") is a [[Christian]] [[liberal arts]] college located in [[Wake Forest, North Carolina]]. Established in 1994, it serves as the undergraduate school for [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sebts.edu/college/about/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Southeastern schools are affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. The school is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sebts.edu/college/about/accreditation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Both of the Southeastern schools are affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The College at Southeastern combines the best of a liberal arts college education with substantial biblical and theological training.

The mission of the college is "to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ by equipping students to serve the church and fulfill the Great Commission."

While Southeastern equips young men for pastoral ministry, the college also equips missionaries, counselors, teachers, youth pastors and others who spread the Gospel across the street and around the world.

Approximately 500 Southeastern college and seminary students and graduates currently serve as foreign missionaries, the vast majority through the International Mission Board. Dozens of graduates serve as North American church planters in urban centers such as Boston, Chicago, Tampa, Atlanta, Richmond and Nashville, as well as underserved rural areas in the Midwest and New England.

Hundreds of Southeastern students from the college and seminary participate annually in short-term mission trips sponsored by the seminary or local churches. Numerous Southeastern professors regularly lead mission trips or teach short-term in overseas settings.

Enrollment is currently approximately 3,250 students including the College at Southeastern and Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Students come from 49 states and are citizens of 33 countries. The College’s current enrollment is approximately 650 students.

== Academics ==

Students can select one of 10 majors and 15 minors and are equipped to employ their Christian worldview in whatever vocation God has called them to serve. Students pursuing a four-year Bachelor of Arts degree will complete a core curriculum, which includes vital training in biblical studies, Christian worldview, world history, theology and English. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts program complete a minor in Christian studies in addition to their selected major.  C@SE also offers a small variety of associate degree programs and certificate programs.

Includes activities such as intramural sports, campus-wide cookouts, coffee houses and concerts.

==History==

Southeastern Seminary opened its doors in 1950 on the [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest College]] campus with a relative handful of students and a mandate to train ministers for churches all over the east coast of the United States. In the nearly sixty years since then the student body has grown considerably and its reach has expanded across the entire globe.

The College at Southeastern began in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://collegeatsoutheastern.com/admissions/default.aspx{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to accommodate the school’s increasing enrollment trustees approved construction of a new academic building at their October 2005 meeting. Since its completion in 2008, Paige and Dorothy Patterson Hall is now the flagship academic building on campus. Patterson Hall houses the Center for Faith and Culture, The College at Southeastern and the school’s doctoral programs.

The Southeastern Board of Trustees elected to change the name of the college from Southeastern College at Wake Forest to the College at Southeastern in April 2008.

In January 2009, Dr. Bruce R. Ashford was installed as dean of The College at Southeastern. He made several important changes during his first few month including new curriculum like minors in leadership and student ministry.

Dr. Jamie Dew succeeded Ashford in January 2013 as the dean of the college.

The College at Southeastern is marked by Ashford and Dew’s vision to give greater flexibility to students’ academic pursuits. The History of Ideas Program engages students to research and read classical works that have shaped history from a Christian perspective. New majors were added such as Global Studies, Missions, Pre-Law, History, Biblical Studies and Worship Ministry.

==Faculty==

The faculty at Southeastern promises to teach in accordance with, and not contrary to, the Abstract of Principles and the Baptist Faith &amp; Message. The school further affirms the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy and the Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.

The school aims to see students become effective disciples of Christ.

'''''The Little Red Schoolbook''''' ({{lang-da|Den Lille Røde Bog For Skoleelever}}; {{lang-en|The Little Red Book For School Pupils}}) is a book written by two [[Danish people|Danish]] schoolteachers, [[Søren Hansen (author)|Søren Hansen]] and [[Jesper Jensen (author)|Jesper Jensen]], published in 1969, that was subject to much controversy upon its publication. The book was translated into many languages in the early 1970s. [[Beatrice Faust]] contributed to the Australian edition of ''The Little Red Schoolbook.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Book that Shook the World", Film Australia, 3 November 2007, [[SBS Television]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

The book encourages young people to question societal norms and instructs them on how to do this. Out of 200 pages, it includes 20 pages on [[sex]] and 30 on drugs, including [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]. Other topics included adults as "[[paper tiger]]s", the duties of teachers, discipline, examinations, intelligence, and different schools.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

== Reception ==

As a result of its subject matter and its targeted audience of schoolchildren, a number of politicians in many countries criticised the book, fearing that the book would erode the moral fabric of society and be an invitation for anarchy in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=354431 2005/214/1 Book, Australian Edition 'The little red schoolbook', Powerhouse Museum, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''LRSB'' was banned in France, Italy and New Zealand.{{cn|date= March 2018}}



In Switzerland, the [[Canton of Bern|Bernese cantonal]] politician [[Hans Martin Sutermeister]] led a campaign against the book. He was successful in temporarily blocking the introduction of the book into the country. The subsequent controversy, however, ended his political career, costing him his job as director of the schools of the Swiss capital and contributed to a split in his party, the [[Ring of Independents]], which led to its mid-term decline.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus H.

In the UK, the book was the subject of a successful prosecution under the [[Obscene Publications Act]], a decision that was upheld by the Appeal Court and subsequently by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case known as ''[[Handyside v United Kingdom]]''. The government however allowed a second, censored edition to be published, in which some of the passages criticised in court were amended or cut.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

The book was banned in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] by the Queensland Literature Board of Review in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/2017/05/04/little-red-school-book/|title=Little Red School Book|last=Bruce|first=Joan|date=4 May 2017|website=John Oxley Library blog, State Library of Queensland|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discussed critically by [[Peter Hitchens]] in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way]]'' (2009).

An unexpurgated edition of the book, bar one minor cut, was published in the UK during July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Moorhead [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/08/the-little-red-schoolbook-republished-soren-hansen "The Little Red Schoolbook - honest about sex and the need to challenge authority"], ''The Guardian'', 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">'''Transactional sex''' refers to [[sexual relationship]]s where the giving of gifts or services is an important factor. Transactional sex is a [[superset]] of [[prostitution]], in that the exchange of gifts for sex includes a broader set of (usually non-marital) obligations that do not necessarily involve a predetermined payment or gift, but where there is a definite motivation to benefit materially from the sexual exchange.{{sfn|Hunter|2002}} The participants do not necessarily frame themselves in terms of prostitutes/clients, but often as girlfriends/boyfriends, or [[sugar baby|sugar babies]]/sugar daddies.{{sfn|Hoefinger|2010}}{{sfn|Hoefinger|2013}} Those offering sex may or may not feel affection for their partners.

== In Sub-Saharan Africa ==

The pervasiveness of transactional sex in sub-saharan Africa, common in non-marital relationships across all income categories, is closely linked to socio-cultural expectations of gender whereby a man is expected to act as a provider to their partners and women expect a compensation for 'giving' sex.  This results in implicit assumptions of exchange, whereby for example a man might buy a woman a drink and her acceptance implies a willingness to have sex. Transactional sex is also becoming a vehicle for migration in places where younger women have intimate relationships with older men from for example Europe or North America.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}

The general consensus among those studying transactional sex is that it is associated with the joint onslaught of [[poverty]] and the influence of Western [[consumerism]], the differences in economic power between men and women, and the breakdown of traditional African marriage customs involving [[bridewealth]]. Some scholars also associate transactional sex with the use of female erotic power and new inter-generational strategies and argue that these are part of a broader moral economy where the money young women earn from transactional sex is redistributed to kin and peers.{{sfn|Groes-Green|2013}}{{sfn|Groes-Green|2014}}{{sfn|Cole|2010}}

Though these relationships are common in Sub-Sahara Africa, they are also increasingly common in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">In [[literature]], the '''tritagonist''' or '''tertiary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|τριταγωνιστής}}, ''tritagōnistḗs'', third actor) is the third most important [[Character (arts)|character]] of a narrative, after the [[protagonist]] and [[deuteragonist]]. In [[ancient Greek drama]], the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe.

As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist.  Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he or she occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller, Karl Otfried]], and [[John William Donaldson]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofliterat01mluoft A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece]'', 1858&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|451}}

==History==
The part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama.  Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|451}}  As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the [[bass (voice type)|bass]] range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone).&lt;ref name="mantzius"&gt;''A History of Theatrical Art'', Mantzius (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}} [[Cicero]], in his ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'', reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;''Divinatio in Caecilium'', [[Cicero]], s. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator [[Aeschines]], who was held by [[Demosthenes]] to have been untalented as a tritagonist,&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|175}} and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|195}}

In some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|404}}

The first two courses on Udacity started on 20 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Robotics Mastermind takes Education Online |first=Blake |last=Graham |url= http://theairspace.net/events/robotic-mastermind/ |newspaper= The Airspace |date=24 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "CS 101: Building a Search Engine", taught by David Evans from the University of Virginia, and "CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car" taught by Thrun. Both courses use [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

Four more courses began on 16 April 2012, encompassing a range of ability and subject matter, with teachers including [[Steve Huffman]] and [[Peter Norvig]]. Five new courses were announced on 31 May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://udacity.blogspot.com/2012/05/udacity-expands-course-offerings-five.html |title = Udacity expands course offerings: Five premiere classes will include physics and mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked the first time Udacity offered courses outside the domain of computer science. Four of these courses launched at the start of the third "[[Academic term|hexamester]]", on 25 June 2012. One course, Logic &amp; Discrete Mathematics: Foundations of Computing, was delayed for several weeks before an email announcement was sent out on 14 August stating that the course would not be launched, although no further explanation was provided.

On 23 August 2012, a new course in [[entrepreneurship]], EP245 taught by retired serial entrepreneur [[Steve Blank]], was announced.&lt;ref name="udacity-newsletter-2012-08"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/udacity-august-newsletter-all-latest.html |title = Udacity August Newsletter: All the latest updates straight to your inbox!}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four new specialized CS courses were announced as part of collaboration with [[Google]], [[Nvidia]], [[Microsoft]], [[Autodesk]], [[Cadence Design Systems]], and [[Wolfram Research]] on 18 October 2012, to be launched in early 2013.&lt;ref name="udacity-new-classes-2012-10-18"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/10/four-new-classes.html |title = Four New Classes! |date=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2012, Thrun's original AI-class from 2011 was relaunched as a course at Udacity, CS271.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/11/ai-class-now-on-udacity.html |title = The Original, Free Online AI Class, now on Udacity! |date = 2012-11-28 |accessdate=2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University credit courses===

Udacity announced a partnership with [[San Jose State University]] (SJSU) on 15 January 2013 to pilot three new courses, two algebra courses and a statistics course, available for college credit at SJSU and offered entirely online.&lt;ref name="udacity-sjsu-plus-announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2013/01/sebastian-thrun-udacity-announces-for.html |title = Sebastian Thrun: Udacity Announces For-Credit Course Pilot with San Jose State University |date = 2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sjsu.edu/plus/ |title = San Jose State Plus |date = 2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three months later, the pilot was expanded to include MA006, MA008, and ST095, as well as two new courses, CS046 and PS001.&lt;ref name="udacity-sjsu-plus-2013-04-15"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2013/04/sebastian-thrun-expanding-college.html |title = Sebastian Thrun: Expanding College Credit Pilot this Summer! |date = 2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2013, the partnership was suspended after more than half of the students failed their final exams.&lt;ref name="sjsu-suspended-slate"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/19/san_jose_state_suspends_udacity_online_classes_after_students_fail_final.html |title = University Suspends Online Classes After More Than Half the Students Fail |date = 2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanodegree===
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}
In June 2014, Udacity and [[AT&amp;T]] announced the "Nanodegree" program, designed to teach programming skills needed to qualify for an entry-level IT position at AT&amp;T. The coursework is said to take less than a year to complete, and cost about US$200/month.  AT&amp;T said it will offer paid internships to some graduates of the program.&lt;ref name="WSJ blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/16/udacity-att-team-up-in-online-ed/ | title=Udacity, AT&amp;T Team Up in Online Ed - Digits - WSJ | publisher=blog.wsj.com | accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/business/economy/udacity-att-nanodegree-offers-an-entry-level-approach-to-college.html?_r=0 | title=Udacity-AT&amp;T ‘NanoDegree’ Offers an Entry-Level Approach to College | publisher=nytimes.com |date=June 17, 2014 | accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;“We can’t turn you into a Nobel laureate,” Mr. Thrun said to a learner. “But what we can do is something like upskilling — you’re a smart person, but the skills you have are inadequate for the current job market, or don’t let you get the job you aspire to have. We can help you get those skills.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/technology/udacity-says-it-can-teach-tech-skills-to-millions.html|title=Udacity Says It Can Teach Tech Skills to Millions, and Fast|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2015-09-16|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[cybersecurity]] nanodegree was announced at the [[RSA Conference]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/22/udacity-tackles-cybersecurity-with-its-latest-nanodegree/|title=Udacity tackles cybersecurity with its latest nanodegree|last=Shieber|first=Jonathan|date=2018-04-22|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-24|publisher=Oath Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course format===
Each course consists of several units comprising video lectures with [[closed captioning]], in conjunction with integrated quizzes to help students understand concepts and reinforce ideas, as well as follow-up homework, which promotes a "learn by doing" model.&lt;ref name='faq'&gt;[https://www.udacity.com/faq Udacity General FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Programming classes use the Python language; programming assignments are graded by automated grading programs on the Udacity servers.

==Enrollment==
Over the first several months of Udacity's existence, enrollment for each class was cut off on the due date of the first homework assignment, and the courses were re-offered each hexamester. Since August 2012, all courses have been "open enrollment"; students can enroll in one or more courses at any time after a course is launched. All course lectures and problem sets are available upon enrollment and can then be completed at the student's preferred pace.&lt;ref name='faq'/&gt;

Udacity had students in 203 countries in the summer of 2012, with the greatest number of students in the United States (42 percent), India (7 percent), Britain (5 percent), and Germany (4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= Chronicle of Higher Education

|date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Udacity students for CS101 range from 13-year-olds to 80-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A First for Udacity: a U.S. University Will Accept Transfer Credit for One of Its Courses   |newspaper= Chronicle of Higher Education |url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-First-for-Udacity-Transfer/134162/ |first=Katherine |last=Mangan |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced 13-year-olds are able to complete multiple, higher-level computer science courses on Udacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peter Norvig and Udacity host 13-year-old student |newspaper=Udacity blog |url=http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/13-year-old-student-visits-udacity-team.html  
|date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
Udacity used to issue certificates of completion of individual courses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/tell-world-you-took-udacity-class.html Udacity Blog: Finished your final? Get an official Udacity certificate]&lt;/ref&gt; but since May 2014 has stopped offering free non-identity-verified certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140419045000/http://blog.udacity.com/2014/04/phasing-out-certificates-of-free16.html Phasing out certificates of free courseware completion]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, beginning 24 August 2012, through partnership with electronic testing company [[Pearson VUE]], students of CS101 can elect to take an additional proctored 75-minute final exam for a fee of $89 in an effort to allow Udacity classes to "count towards a credential that is recognized by employers".&lt;ref name="udacity-newsletter-2012-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-vue-partnership"&gt;{{cite web |title=Udacity in partnership with Pearson VUE announces testing centers |url= http://blog.udacity.com/2012/06/udacity-in-partnership-with-pearson-vue.html |date = 2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-cs101"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proctored exam for Intro to Computer Science now available |url= http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/proctored-exam-in-basic-python-and.html |date = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further plans announced for certification options would include a "secured online examination" as a less expensive alternative to the in-person proctored exams.&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-cs101"/&gt;

[[Colorado State University]]'s Global Campus began offering transfer credit for the introductory computer science course (CS101) for Udacity students that take the final examination through a secure testing facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = CSU forging smart partnerships in online studies | date = 27 October 2012 | publisher = Gannett | url = http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20121027/OPINION01/310270029/CSU-forging-smart-partnerships-online-studies | work = Coloradoan.com | accessdate = 2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Udacity started the Nanodegree program, it is a paid credential program. Udacity also offers Nanodegree plus, which is a bit more expensive, but guarantees a job, if they fail to provide a job, the course fee is returned, although it plans to cancel the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.udacity.com/2016/07/nanodegree-101.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In November 2012, founder Sebastian Thrun won the Smithsonian American Ingenuity in Education Award for his work with Udacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sebastian Thrun wins Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in Education for Udacity work!

Universalism, in [[human geography]], signals the position that ideas of development produced in Western social sciences hold for all times and places.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. (2000) Universalism, in R. Johnston, D. Gregory, G. Pratt and M. Wats(eds), “The Dictionary of Human Geography". Oxford: Blackwell, 869-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Universalist thinking began in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when philosophers decided on "truths" that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately. [[Development geography]], human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal "truths". Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe, North America and the rest of the "developed" world at the top, as the centre of knowledge, and placing the rest of the globe below, as ignorant and needing to be educated. The hierarchy reiterates the [[core-periphery]] notion, examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space.

==Origins==
As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale, new "truths" were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, V.L., "Making Development Geography". London: Hodder Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;   They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote that "the truths of [modern] science are independent of any local context", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., "Selected Writings".Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal "truths".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not authentically true at all.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T.  ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global diffusion==
As universal "truth" claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals, they began an important transition into the school system.  [[Michel Foucault]] describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As "truth" claims were taught to children, they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses. Once cemented within such institutions, they were able to flourish and remain.

Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive [[colonisation]] around the globe, supposed universal "truths" began to diffuse across borders, space and place.  Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to [[modernisation]].

==Changing truths==
The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s, when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science. By the mid-1980s, geographical sensibility towards science increased, seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made, became credible and flowed globally.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. ''Placing the View from Nowhere: Historical and Sociological Problems in the Location of Science''. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of [[epistemology]] with relation to place and confront "truth" formation with a more culturally ecological ([[cultural ecology]]) approach.

==Foucaulta  truths==
Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth. Foucault discusses truth in terms of "societal regimes of truth" and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting "the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true" and creating and controlling "the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth.

'''''Vägmärken''''' ('''''Markings''''', or more literally '''''Waymarks'''''), published in 1963, is the only book by former [[UN secretary general]], [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]. The journal was discovered after his death, with a covering letter to his literary executor, "a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld - Biographical | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1961/hammarskjold-bio.html

== Personal significance ==
[[File:Dag-hammarskjold 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dag Hammarskjöld]], author of ''Markings'']]A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskjöld's death in the Congo.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As van Dusen writes: "His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner ([[:sv:Sture Linner|sv]]), head of the [[Congo Crisis|United Nations mission to the Congo]]. He left there the copy of the German original of [[Ich und Du]] (I and Thou) presented to him by [[Martin Buber]] and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of [[Thomas a Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was always on the table of his [[New York City]] apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of ''Markings'' was found."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the entries in ''Markings'' describe Hammarskjöld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: "Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) [[Faber and Faber]] London 1964 p175&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld died in a plane crash in [[Zambia]], near midnight, on September 17–18, 1961. The last entry of ''Markings'' is dated 24 August 1961: "Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual significance ==
''Markings'' was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as "the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for [[world peace]] and order."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 5&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the "Way' of Dag Hammarskjöld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld writes, for example, "We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it—according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed—according to the measure of his purity of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of 4 August 1959 reads: "To have humility is to experience reality, not ''in relation to ourselves'', but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary significance ==
''Markings'' is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and [[haiku]] poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Basho]] in his ''[[Narrow Roads to the Deep North]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149&lt;/ref&gt; Representative examples include:

The Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx.&lt;br /&gt;
Drops pausing&lt;br /&gt;
Between earth and sky.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p150&lt;/ref&gt;

They laid the blame on him.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn't know what it was,&lt;br /&gt;
But he confessed it.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees quiver in the wind,&lt;br /&gt;
Sailing on a sea of mist&lt;br /&gt;
Out of earshot.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to ''Markings'', the English poet [[W. H. Auden]] states: "''Markings'', however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account—and I cannot myself recall another—of the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the ''Via Activa'' and the ''Via Contemplativa''." &lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating "In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action."&lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
