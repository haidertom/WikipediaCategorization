'''''Almond Blossoms''''' is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Arles]] and [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], [[southern France]] of blossoming [[almond]] trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh.  They represented awakening and hope.  He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of [[Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]], and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut]]s. ''Almond Blossom'' was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]].

==Southern France==
In 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career.  In connection with their painting ''[[Farmhouse in Provence]]'' (1888), the [[National Gallery of Art]] notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,
reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was "the Japan of the South." Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.  Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |work=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830—1900) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Gallery of Art |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |page=12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 [[fruit tree]]s in the orchards were about to bloom.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=49| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[blossom]]s of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him,&lt;ref name=VGM671&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3128&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Almond Blossom, 1890  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees.&lt;ref name=VGM557&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0035V1962 |title=Almond Tree in Blossom, 1888   |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day.&lt;ref name=Fell&gt;{{cite book| author=Fell, D |year=2001 |title=Van Gogh's Gardens | location=United Kingdom |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=25 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 21 he wrote to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], that he "will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming."&lt;ref name=VGM557/&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Japonaiserie Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)''&lt;br&gt;by Vincent van Gogh, 1887 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], [[Amsterdam]] (F371)]]
Van Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese [[woodcut|wood block]] prints.  [[Hiroshige]]'s  ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow.  Van Gogh used the term ''[[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]]'' to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]].  Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called ''[[ukiyo-e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=54 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Wallace70"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853—1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, "Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop."&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=200 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer.  He wrote, "I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety."  While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | pages=43–44| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book''==
Vincent wrote to Theo, "Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,"  and he has "two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it."  The two studies are ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass'' and ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/466.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 3 March 1888 in Arles.  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits  |accessdate=2011-04-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''==
Although [[fruit tree]]s were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles,&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt; the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2515&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=Sprig of Flowering Almond Blossom in a Glass, 1888 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt;

In ''Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life'', [[Bruce Ross]] evaluates the [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] effect on van Gogh's work, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Van Gogh's bright ''Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass'' embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass.  The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space.  There is no formal decorative intent.  Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope.  Van Gogh has transformed the still  life with the help of these values.  He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility.  His use of bright color reflects this.  There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, [[ikebana]], in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life | author=Ross, B | editor=Trutty-Coohill, P  | publisher=Springer | location=Heidelberg, London, and New York | year=2010 | pages=215–216| chapter=Vincent van Gogh's Irises: Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights | isbn=978-90-481-9159-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmIacB5qVZ0C&amp;pg=PA215|quote=These streams include: 1) French impressionist's practice of using unadorned objects from life and 2) use of space between objects as objects themselves to the point of over-orchestration. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Almond Blossom''==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Almond blossom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Almond blossom'', 1890 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], (F671)]]  
In mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, "The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 14 March 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits   |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In ''Almond Tree in Blossom'', Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of [[divisionism]] for a sparkling surface effect.  The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rendering of ''Almond Blossom'' is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.

Theo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife.  He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;

Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo's]] baby,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/627.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to His Mother. Written c. 20 February 1890 in Saint-Rémy. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt; The close-up of the branches brings to mind [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s proposition that "even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;  The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights: Lectures and Essays on Philosophy, Literature and the Arts | author=Ross, B | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | location=New York | year=208 | page=52 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HvvB-xrxxUC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|220px|Detail of the ''Apollon de Mantoue'' ([[Louvre Museum]])]] 
The '''Apollo of Mantua''' and its variants are early forms of the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm.  The type-piece, the first example discovered, is named for its location at Mantua; the type is represented by [[neo-Attic]] Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]] but more archaic.  The Apollo held the ''cythara''  against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example (''illustration'') a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. 

More than a dozen other replicas of the type have been found, the principal ones being those conserved in the national museums of [[Naples]] and of [[Mantua]].

The lost original would have been bronze. The name of the teacher of [[Phidias]], [[Hegias of Athens]] is sometimes invoked, but there are no surviving examples of Hegias' work to judge from.

Examples include:

:The Naples ''Apollo of Mantua'', a bronze found at [[Pompeii]], in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]], Naples (inv. 5630).

:The Louvre ''Apollo of Mantua'', formerly in the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], entered the museum in 1871.

:The [[Fogg Art Museum]] ''Apollo of Mantua'', a Roman bronze&lt;ref&gt;Spectroscopy revealed the alloy in fact to be [[brass]] (Congdon 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; head of the ''Apollo of Mantua'' type, originally about one-third lifesize.

'''[[Pre-Romanesque]]''' architecture in [[Asturias]] is framed between the years 711 and 910, the period of the creation and expansion of the [[kingdom of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Iberia: The Dynamics of Change |author= S. J. Keay, Margarita Díaz-Andreu García |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-12012-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kq8R9n4M10C&amp;pg=PA236 | page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical introduction==
In the 5th century, the [[Goths]], a Christianized tribe of Eastern Germanic origin, arrived in the [[Iberian peninsula]] after the fall of the [[Roman empire]], and dominated most of the territory,
attempting to continue Roman order by the so-called ''Ordo Gothorum''.

In the year 710, the Visigothic king [[Wittiza]] died, and instead of being succeeded by the eldest of his three sons, [[Agila II|Agila]], the throne was usurped by the duke of [[Baetica]], [[Roderic]]. The young heir sought support to recover the throne, and apart from local backing, he approached the Muslim Kingdom in [[northern Africa]]. [[Tarik]], the caliph of [[Damascus]] governor in Tangier, received permission to offer his army and disembark in [[Spain]], ready to face the Visigothic army of King [[Roderic]].

On July 19, 711, the [[battle of Guadalete]] took place near [[Gibraltar]], where supporters of Witiza's heir, backed by Tarik's Muslim army, killed King Roderic and destroyed the Visigothic army. Tarik and his troops then took advantage of their military superiority, and marched on the Visigothic capital, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], taking it almost without opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Art |author=Harold W. Osborne|year= 1970|publisher=Clarendon P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the chronicles, [[Asturian people|Asturian]] mercenaries, who had already been recruited by the Romans for their courage and fighting spirit, fought alongside King [[Roderic]]. These warriors, together with the rest of the retreating Gothic army, sought refuge in the mountains of Asturias, where they also tried to safeguard some of the sacred relics from Toledo cathedral, the most important of which was the Holy Ark, containing a large number of relics from [[Jerusalem]].

The kingdom of Asturias arose exactly seven years later, in 718, when the Astur tribes, rallied in assembly, decided to appoint [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]] as their leader, a person of uncertain origin, since for some chroniclers he was a Visigothic [[nobleman]] who fled from the Muslim conquerors and for others he was an indigenous nobleman associated with the Visigothic kingdom. Whatever the case, Pelayo joined the local tribes and the refuged Visigoths under his command, with the intention of progressively restoring Gothic Order, based on the kingdom of Toledo's political model.

The kingdom of Asturias disappeared with King [[Alfonso III of León|Alfonso III]], who died in December of the year 910. In barely two hundred years, the 12 kings of the dynasty founded by Pelayo were to gradually recover territory from the Muslims ([[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), a process which finally required the court to be moved south, to León, for its strategic position in the struggle that culminated 800 years after it had started (1492) with the taking of [[Granada]] and the expulsion of the last [[Arabic]] king from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The symbol of the [[flag of Asturias]], a golden cross (significantly called "La Victoria"), and a blue background with the Latin motto ''Hoc signo, tvetvr pivs, Hoc signo vincitvr inimicvs'' (With this sign the pious is protected, With this sign you shall defeat the enemy), sums up the unified character that Christianity gave the armed struggle.

==Pre-Romanesque as the Asturian monarchy's artistic expression==
Asturian Pre-Romanesque is a singular feature in all Spain, which, while combining elements from other styles ([[Visigothic]], [[Mozarabic]] and local traditions), created and developed its own personality and characteristics, reaching a considerable level of refinement, not only as regards construction, but also in terms of decoration and [[gold]] ornamentation. This last aspect can be seen in such relevant works as the Cross of the Angels, the Victory Cross, the agate Box (housed in the Holy Chamber of [[Cathedral of San Salvador (Oviedo)|Oviedo Cathedral]]), the Reliquary in [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] Cathedral and the Cross of Santiago.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:caja de las agatas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The agate box]] --&gt;
As [[court]] [[architecture]], the situation of Pre-Romanesque monuments followed in the wake of the various locations of the kingdom's capital; from its original site in [[Cangas de Onís]] (Eastern Asturias), through [[Pravia]] (west of the central coast), to its final location in [[Oviedo]], the region's geographical centre.

As regards its evolution, from its appearance, Asturian Pre-Romanesque followed a ''"stylistic sequence closely associated with the kingdom's political evolution, its stages clearly outlined".''
Five stages are distinguished; a first period (737–791) belonging to the reigns of the kings [[Favila of Asturias|Fáfila]], [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]], [[Fruela I]], [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelio]], [[Silo]], [[Mauregato]] and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Vermudo I]]. A second stage comprises the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791–842), entering a stage of stylistic definition, and third comprises the reigns of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842–850) and [[Ordoño I of Asturias|Ordoño I]] (850–866); a fourth belongs to the reign of Alfonso III (866–910) and a fifth and last which coincides with the transfer of the court to [[León, Spain|León]], the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias, and simultaneously, of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.

==Monuments of interest==

===First Period (737 to 791)===
From this period, of the young kingdom's rise and consolidation, the existence of two churches have been registered. The [[Santa Cruz de Cangas de Onís|Church of Santa Cruz]] (737) at the court's original location, Cangas de Onís, of which we only have written references, because it was destroyed in 1936. The present-day one dates from 1950 and, like the original, is built over a barrow covering a [[dolmen]]. The legend goes that the name Santa Cruz ("Holy Cross") comes from the oaken cross carried by King Pelayo in the [[battle of Covadonga]], the first ''"little-big victory"'' against the Arabs, which was later to be covered in gold and [[precious stones]] (reign of Alfonso III), coming to be called ''La Victoria'', and emblem of the Asturian flag. Chronicles state that the Church of Santa Cruz was built in stone masonry, one nave with a barrel vault and a main chapel on one side. 
[[File:Santianes de Pravia.jpg|thumb|250px|Santianes de Pravia]]
The second of these constructions is the [[Church of San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista, Santianes de Pravia]], located in Santianes. Its construction results from the move of the royal court from [[Cangas de Onís]] to [[Pravia]], an old Roman settlement (Flavium Navia) and crossroads. The church, built between the years 774 and 783, already showed a number of elements anticipating Asturian Pre-Romanesque; eastward-facing, [[basilica]] ground plan (central [[nave]] and two side [[aisle]]s), separated by three semicircular [[arch]]es, [[transept]] facing the central nave with the same length as the width of the three [[aisle]]s. It also had a single, semicircular [[apse]], and an external entrance [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]], with a wooden [[ceiling]] over the nave.

Several sculptural decorative elements showing floral and geometric designs (something habitual in what were to be the characteristics of subsequent Pre-Romanesque), are on public display in the [[sacristy]], where there is a [[museum]].

===Second Period (791 to 842)===
Alfonso II, known as ''"the Chaste"'' (maybe for this reason he never had descendants), was a decisive king in the Asturian monarchy. From a military point of view, he definitively established the kingdom against the Muslims (in the famous [[battle of Lutos]] he gained a significant victory), in administration he moved the court to its final site in Oviedo, and in politics he set up cordial, stable relationships with the emperor [[Charlemagne]], as demonstrated by the following quote by Eginardo (Vita caroli): {{cquote|''...the emperor (Charlemagne) was so closely united with Alfonso, king of Asturias and Galicia, that each time he sent a letter or ambassador, he ordered that he be given no treatment other than that of his client.''}}

As regards patronage of art, Alfonso II promoted the largest number of Pre-Romanesque buildings defining what were to be this style's characteristics. With the royal architect, [[Tioda]], he built the churches of [[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo]], [[San Julián de los Prados]], [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa María de Bendones]] and [[Church of San Pedro de Nora|San Pedro de Nora]], in addition to the palace complex in Oviedo, now disappeared, consisting of the churches of San Salvador, Santa María and its adjoining palace and chapel (now the Holy Chamber of Oviedo Cathedral, the only one remaining), containing relies such as the Holy Ark and jewels, like the [[Cross of the Angels]], which he donated himself to the [[Cathedral of Oviedo|Church of San Salvador]]. Outside Asturias, with the legend of the discovery of the apostle [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]' tomb in Galicia, in a place known as ''campus stellae'' ([[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]), Alfonso II had the first church built in the saints honour (year 892).
[[File:Santullano.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santullano]]
When the Church of '''[[San Julián de los Prados]], or Santuyano''', was built (approx. between the years  (812 and 842), it formed part of a series of royal buildings. The church had a basilica ground plan [central nave and two side aisles), separated by three semicircular arches on impost capitals and square columns. It is worth noting the existence of a [[transept]] or transversal aisle located between the aisles and the sanctuary, exceeding the central nave in height.

Finally, there was a straight sanctuary, divided into three [[chapel]]s, and over the main one, only accessible from outside, there was a room whose function is still open to conjecture. As for the roof, the church had an interesting oaken ceiling carved with a variety of geometric designs.

As elements outside the ground plan, there was a vestibule (to the east) and two sacristies adjoining the north and south facades, communicating directly with the transept. The Church of [[San Julián de los Prados]] is the largest of the pre-romanesque churches.

From an ornamental point of view, the [[mural]]s covering the walls and ceilings of this church are the best-conserved upper medieval paintings in Spain. the technique used is ''al [[fresco]]'' painting (applied with the [[plaster]] still wet), arranged in three well-defined areas. Decorative designs show clear influence of mural painting from the Roman period, recreating a certain atmosphere typical of the ''"theatrical style"'' (1st century B.C.). Decorative elements are numerous; [[marble]] imitation, rectangles, bands, weaving, squares, imitation channeling and columns, medallions decorated with plant motifs, architectural designs, curtains, though totally lacking in any portrayal of biblical or religious scenes, with the single exception of the [[Anastasis Cross]] (alpha and omega), as a symbol of royal power. This lack of figurative representation is known as [[aniconism]] and was not maintained in later Pre-Romanesque churches.

The '''[[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo|church of San Tirso]]''', located beside the [[Cathedral of Oviedo]], only conserves the end wall of the apse from its original construction, because it was destroyed by fire in the 16th century. The section remaining shows the original construction in stone blocks, and in the centre, there is the characteristic three-point window of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, with semicircular arches made of brick. The central opening, larger than the side ones, is supported by free-standing columns.

The [[Cámara Santa, Oviedo|Holy Chamber]] was built as a palace chapel for Alfonso II and the church of San Salvador (both demolished in the 14th century to build the present Gothic cathedral). The Chamber, adjoining the pre-Romanesque Tower of San Miguel, also had the function of housing
relies brought from Toledo after the fall of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom. It consists of two overlapping aisles with a barrel vault; the crypt or lower floor has a height of 2.30 metres, and is dedicated to [[St. Leocadia]], containing several tombs of other [[martyr]]s.

The upper floor, dedicated to [[St. Michael]], was extended in the 12th century, elongating the central section to six metres, a reconstruction that also provided it with its current decoration, a masterpiece of Spanish [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. From an architectural point of view, the Holy Chamber's construction solved one of the greatest problems of Asturian Pre-Romanesque: the vaulting of two overlapping spaces, later used in the buildings of Ramiro I.

As mentioned above, a from acting as royal chapel, the Holy Chamber was built to house the jewels and relies of the cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo, a function it continues to have 1,200 years later. Some of these jewels were donated by the Kings Alfonso II and Alfonso III, and represent extraordinary gold artefacts of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.

The first of them is the [[Cross of the Angels]], created in 808 in [[Gauzón]] (the left bank of the estuary of [[Avilés]]) on the instructions of [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], who donated the precious stones necessary to make it from his personal treasury. The Cross of the Angels takes its name from the legend that it was made and given to Alfonso II by [[angel]]s, who appeared to him in the form of [[pilgrim]]s. The Greek cross (equal arms) has a core of [[cherry]] wood and in the centre there is a circular disk acting as connection for the four arms. The anverse is covered with a filigreed mesh of gold thread and bands of geometric decoration with a total of 48 precious stones ([[agate]]s, [[sapphire]]s, [[aamethysts]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and [[opal]]s) of great beauty.The reverse is covered with fine sheet of gold held by silver nails. Decoration on this side shows, mounted on the central disk, a large elliptical agate cameo, and a large stone at the end of each arm.

Exactly one century later, in 908, to commemorate a hundred years of the Asturían kingdom's victories and conquests, Alfonso III donated Pre-Romanesque most important gold artifact to Oviedo Cathedral: the [[Victory Cross]] or Santa Cruz, a Latin cross (unequal arms) of 92&amp;nbsp;cm by 72&amp;nbsp;cm. The core is made of two pieces of oak with circular ends finished in three foils, and joined in the centre by a circular disk. The whole cross is covered with gold leaf and filigree, and richly decorated especially the anverse, covered with coloured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[pearls]], precious stones and gold thread. The reverse shows an inscription in soldered gold letters, mentioning the donors to the [[Cathedral of Oviedo|Church of San Salvador]], King Alfonso III and Queen Jimena, and the place (Gauzón Castle again) and the year it was made.

The last of the Pre-Romanesque jewels on in the Holy Chamber of the [[Cathedral of Oviedo]] is the [[Agate box]], donated to the church by [[Fruela II of Asturias]] (son of Alfonso II), and his wife Nunilo, in the year 910, when he was still a prince. This extraordinary gold artifact in mozarabic style is a rectangular reliquary made from [[Cupressus|cypress]] with a semi-pyramidal shaped lid. The covered with gold plate, with 99 little arch shaped openings, framed in woven gold thread, containing agates. The most valuable part of this piece is the upper part of the lid, probably re-used from another, smaller reliquary of Carolingian origin, a hundred years older than the rest. This plaque is decorated with panels of enamel, in turn surrounded by 655 encrusted garnets.

Continuing with the architectural works of the second period of Pre-Romanesque art, the last two are the churches of [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa Maria de Bendones]] and [[Church of San Pedro de Nora|San Pedro de Nora]]. The first is located just fíve kilometres from the capital, in a south-east direction, towards the [[Nalón (Asturian comarca)|Nalón]] valley, and was a donation from King Alfonso III and his wife Jimena to San Salvador cathedral, on January 20, 905. Very similar to Santullano, although the ground plan is not the typical basilica of  the Pre-Romanesque churches, but has three enclosures at the western end, the central one as an entrance vestibule and two side areas possibly to house parishioners or ecciesiastics. This entrance leads into a single nave with a wooden ceiling, covered by an interesting roof, the same length as the entrance enclosures. The nave adjoins two rectangular side areas, also with a wooden ceiling, whose use seems to associated with the liturgical rites of the period. this nave joined with the sanctuary by three semicircular brick arches, each of which leads into its corresponding chapel, of which only the main or central one is covered with a brick barrel vault, the other two with wooden ceilings.

Above the main chapel is the "typical" chamber, only accessible from outside, through a trefoil window with the standard Pre-Romanesque features; central arch larger than the side  ones, resting on two free-standing capitals with rope moulding, and the upper rectangle framed by simple moulding.

Independent from the church structure, though close to its southern facade, stands the bell tower, on a rectangular ground plan.

The [[Church of San Pedro de Nora]] is located beside the River Nora, about twelve kilometres from Oviedo. This church has the construction style established in Santullano: facing eastwards, vestibule separate from the main structure, basilica-type ground plan, central nave higher than the side aisles, with intersecting wooden roof and lit by Windows with stone lattice. The straight sanctuary is divided into three apses with barrel vaults. As a differentiating element, the apses were joined to each other through the dividing walls by semicircular-arched doors. Like all the churches from this period, there was a room over the apse, only accessible from outside through a trefoil window. The bell tower, separate from the church like in [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa Maria de Bendones]], does not belong to the original construction, and stems from an initiative in the seventies by the architect and great restorer of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, [[Luis Menéndez Pidal y Alvarez]].

===Third period (842 to 866)===
This period corresponds with the reigns of Ramiro I and Ordoño I. The first, son of Vermudo I, succeeded Alfonso II when he died without descendants, taking charge of a rapidly expanding kingdom. He was described by chroniclers as ''Virga justitiae'' (baton of justice) because he had to face two internal rebellions by noblemen and due to his enthusiasm in hunting down magic and the black arts, very widespread in Asturias at the time. He also fought the [[Normans]] successfully, defeating them in [[Gijón]] and [[A Coruña]]. Paradoxically, he enjoyed a time of peace with his traditional enemies, the Muslims, which from an artistic point of view allowed him to substantially renew Pre-Romanesque's architecture and decorative style, giving rise to the so-called Ramirian style.

Ramiro I was succeeded by his son Ordoño I, who inherited a very solid kingdom from a military perspective, a condition that let him use subjects from the kingdom of Asturias to re-populate abandoned cities on the other side of the mountains, such as [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] and León. He measured his military might against the Arabs with varying results; in the [[battle of Clavijo]] (year 859) he easily defeated them, though six years later, at Hoz de la Morcuera, his army, led by one of his generals, suffered a defeat, halting the intense re-population work of the first part of his reign.
[[File:Santa Maria del Naranco.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santa María del Naranco]]
The first of the works from this period, the Palace of '''[[Santa María del Naranco]]''', involved a significant stylistic, morphological, constructive and decorative renovation of Pre-Romanesque, supplementing it with new, innovative resources, representing a leap forward with respect to immediately previous periods. Built as a recreational palace, it is situated on the southern side of Monte Naranco facing the city, and was originally part of a series of royal buildings located in the outskirts. Its character as a civil building changed in the 12th century when it
was converted into a church dedicated to St. Mary.

This palace's innovations amazed chroniclers, who repeatedly mention it over time. A case in point is the [[Crónica Silense]], written around the year 1015, about 300 years after its construction, and which, on describing Ramiro I, states that ''"(...)he built many constructions, two miles away from Oviedo, with sandstone and marble in a vaulted work: (...) He also made (...), a palace without wood, of admirable construction and vaulted below and above,...".''

What marvelled the chroniclers for so many centuries were its proportions and slender shapes, its rich, varied decoration and the introduction ofelongated barrel vaults thanks to the transverse 
arches, allowing support and eliminating wooden ceilings. This solution, timidly advanced in the Holy Chamber, fully matured in Santa Maria del Naranco.

The palace, on a rectangular ground plan, has two floors; the lower level, or [[crypt]], quite low, has a central chamber and another two located on either side. The upper floor is accessed via a double exterior stairway adjoining the facade, leading into an identical layout as the lower floor; a central or noble hall with six blind semicircular arches along the walls, supported by columns built into the wall, and a mirador at each end. These are accessed via three arches, similar to those onto the wall, resting on columns with helicoidal rope moulding, typical of Pre-Romanesque. The barrel vault is made from tufa stone, and is held up by six transverso arches resting on consoles.

Santa Maria del Naranco represented a step forward from a decorative point of view by enriching the habitual standards and modeis with elements from painting, gold work and the textile arts. The rich decoration is concentrated in the hall and miradors of the upper floor, where it is especially worth noting the cubic-prismatic capitals (of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influence), decorated with reliefs framed by [[Rope|cord]] decoration (from local tradition) in trapezoid and triangular shapes, inside which there are sculpted forms of animals and humans. This kind of motif is repeated on the disks with central medallions located above the blind arches' intersections. The 32 medallions distributed around the building are similar in size and shape, varying the decorative designs and the interior figures (quadrupeds, birds, bunches of grapes, fantastic animáis), a style inherited from the Visigoth period, in turn descended from Byzantine tradition.

The medallions have decorative bands above them, again framed by rope moulding, inside which four figures are scuipted and arranged symmetrically; the upper two carrying loads on their heads and the lower two representing soldiers on horseback carrying swords. These figures seem to have some kind of symbolic social meaning; the warriors who defend and support the men of prayer (here offeres),or alternatively, the royal and ecclesiastic orders complementing each other.

Santa María del Naranco shows other, equally beautiful and important sculptural elements; for the first time, a Greek cross appears sculpted as emblem of the Asturian monarchy, at the same time protecting the building from all evil, something which was to become habitual in the popular architecture of towns and villages. Other sculptural elements, such as the capitals of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] inspiration on the miradors' triple-arched Windows or the altar stone in the eastern mirador (originally from the neighbouring Church of San Miguel de Liño/Lillo), make this palace the most distinctive building in Pre-Romanesque, a singularity highlighted by being the only palace complex that has lasted until the present day with both Visigothic and [[Carolingian]] court structures.

[[File:San Miguel de Lillo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel de Lillo]]
The church of '''[[San Miguel de Lillo]]''' was consecrated by Ramiro I and his wife Paterna in the year 848. It was originally dedicated to [[St. Mary]] until, as mentioned above (and shown by the altar located in the eastern mirador of santa María del Naranco), this worship passed to the nearby palace in the 12th century, leaving this church dedicated to St. Michael.
[[File:San Miguel de Lillo plan.svg|thumb|right|100px|Ground plan]] It originally had a basilica ground plan, three aisles with a barrel vault, although part of the original structure has disappeared as the building fell into decay during the 12th or 13th century. Nowadays, it conserves its western half from that period, together with several elements in the rest of the church such as the fantastic jambs in the vestibule or the extraordinary [[latticework|lattice]] on the window of the southern wall, sculpted from one single piece of stone.

The last of the churches from this period is [[Santa Cristina de Lena]]''' ''', located in the [[Lena, Asturias|Lena]] district, about 25&amp;nbsp;km south of Oviedo, on an old Roman road that joined the lands of the [[plateau]] with Asturias. The church has a different ground plan to Pre-Romanesque´s traditional basilica. It is a single rectangular space with a barrel vault, with four adjoining structures located in the centre of each facade. The first of these annexes is the typical Austrian Pre-Romanesque vestibule, with a royal tribune on the upper part, accessed via a stairway joined to one of the walls. To the east is the enclosure with the [[altar]], with a single apse, foregoing the traditional Asturian pre-romanesque triple apse, and going back to Visigoth influences. To the north and south respectively, there are two other enclosures through semicircular arches and barrel vaults, whose use was associated with the Hispano-Visigothic liturgy practised in Spain up to the 11th century.

One of the most particular elements of Santa Cristina de Lena is the existence of the presbytery elevated above floor level in the last section of the central nave, separated from the area intended for the congregation by three arches on marble columns. This separation,
which appears in other Asturian churches, is not repeated in any other with a similar structure. Both the lattices over the arches and the wall enclosing the central arch were re-used from Visigothic origins in the 7th century.

On the outside of the church, it is worth noting the large number of buttresses (32) which seem in some cases to have a merely aesthetic function. Nearby this church is the Asturian Pre-Romanesque Information Centre, located in the old Norte de la Cobertoria Railway Station.

===Fourth period (866 to 910)===
This comprises the reign of Alfonso III, who came to the throne at the age of 18, on the death of his father, Ordoño I, marking the zenith of the kingdom of Asturias. Expansion against Islam led him to conquer [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in present-day [[Portugal]], and he pushed the borders of the kingdom as far as the [[Mondego River|Mondego]], repopulating [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], [[Simancas]], [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] and the whole area known as [[Campos Góticos]]. The idea of the Asturian kingdom as a 
continuation of the Visigoths in Toledo was fully assumed, involving the obligation to re-conquer all the territory occupied by Muslims. This idea was reflected in the historical chronicles, such as the [[Codex Vigilanus|Crónica Albeldense]], written in Oviedo in the year 881, which tells the history of the Gothic kingdom (Ordo Gentis gothorum), followed by the Asturian monarchy (''Ordo Gothorum Obetensium fíegnum'')T he kingdom's moment of expansion and maturity was also reflected in a cultural revitalisation promoted from the court, involving architectural and artistic renewal.

The kingdom's progressive expansion and increasing power also kindled the ambition of Alfonso III's three sons ([[García I of León|García I]], [[Ordoño II]] and [[Fruela II]]), who, encouraged by a number of noblemen, dispossessed the king and confined him in the town of Boiges (Boides valley, present-day Valdediós). Even so, they allowed him to lead a final campaign against the Muslims in Zamora, where he was victorious once more. He died on his return, in December of the year 910. Described in the chronicles as ''"Great King and Emperor"'' (Magnus Imperatore ImpemtorNoster),the king who had achieved the kingdom's greatest expansion and consolidation since it was founded by Pelayo, could not prevent his since from splitting it into three parts, [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Castile-León]], meaning the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias.

San Salvador de Valdediós and Santo Adriano de Tuñón are the two churches built by this monarch, in addition to the [[La Foncalada|Foncalada fountain]] (''fonte incalata'') in the centre of Oviedo, and the already-mentioned gold artefacts of the [[Victory Cross]] and the [[Agate box]].
[[File:SanSalvadorValdedios-1.jpg|left|thumb|San Salvador de Valdediós [[monastery]]]]
The [[Church of San Salvador de Valdediós]] stands in the Boides valley ([[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]), the place where Alfonso III was detained when he was dispossessed by his sons, and where there used to be an old convent governed by the Benedictine Order, substituted in the 13th century by the Cistercians. The church known as the "Bishops' Chapel" was consecrated on September 16, 893, with seven bishops in attendance, and stands on a classic basilica ground plan with a triple sanctuary, separating the central nave from the side aisles with four semicircular arches.
At the western end, there are three enclosures, the central one used as an access vestibule, and two located on the left and right which may have been used to house pilgrims. The vault over the central nave, like the one over the apses, is barrelled with a brick ceiling and decorated with al fresco wall painting, alternating a variety of geometric designs.[[File:San Salvador de Valdediós plan.svg|thumb|right|100px|Valdediós ground plan]]

The royal tribune is located above the vestibule, separate from the area intended for the congregation (''spatium fidelium'') in the central nave, and this from the area devoted to the liturgy by iron grilles, now disappeared. Particular elements of this church include the covered gallery annexed to the southern facade at a later date or Royal Portico, the 50&amp;nbsp;cm square columns on the central naves arches, the triple-arched window open in the central apse, and the room above it, exclusively accessed from the exterior by a window which here has two openings, compared with the habitual three.

The [[Church of Santo Adriano de Tuñón]] is located on the bank of the River Trubia, next to an old Roman road. Founded on January 24, 891, it stands on a classic basilica ground plan, although in the 17th and 18th centuries it was extended with a nave structure at the western end, and a bell gable. The al fresco paintings in this church are the only remains of Mozarabic painters' work in an Asturian art workshop.

Finally, the [[La Foncalada|Foncalada fountain]], the only upper medieval civil construction conserved in Spain, was built on the outside of Oviedo city walls, with stone blocks and an intersecting roof, barrel vault and rectangular ground plan. The intersection of the roof is topped with a triangular pediment, sculpted with the Victory Cross, characteristic of Alfonso III, under which runs the typical inscription of the kingdom of Asturias: 
{{cquote|{{allcaps|Hoc signo tvetvr pivs, hoc signo vincitvr inimicvs}}}}

===Fifth period (910 to 925)===
With Alfonso III dead and the kingdom of Asturias divided among his sons, Asturian Pre-Romanesque entered its last stage with two constructions. The first of them is the [[Church of San Salvador de Priesca]] (a few kilometres from Valdediós), consecrated on September 24, 921, which has the architectural and decorative reference of the model laid down by Santullano, and not subsequent works. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent several reconstructions, altering especially the structures adjoining the vestibule, by communicating them with the side aisles.

The [[Church of Santiago de Gobiendes]], located near [[Colunga]], next to the sea and the [[Sueve mountain range]], is the last of the Pre-Romanesque churches, and like the previous one, follows the Santullano construction model. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent significant reform, altering the entrance, facade, main and side chapels.

The '''Azelin chandelier''' ({{lang-de|Azelinleuchter}}) is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[wheel chandelier]], made in the 11th century for the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, a UNESCO [[World Cultural Heritage]] site since 1985. It is the oldest of four extant wheel chandeliers from that period, along with the [[Hezilo chandelier]], also in Hildesheim, the [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in the [[Aachen Cathedral]], and the Hartwig chandelier in the [[Comburg|Abbey of Comburg]]. It was believed to be donated by [[list of bishops of Hildesheim|Bishop]] [[Azelin]], however his predecessor [[Thietmar of Hildesheim|Thietmar]] is more likely to be the patron. Therefore, the chandelier is also called the Thietmar chandelier (''Thietmarleuchter'').

== Description ==

[[File:Hildesheim Azelinleuchter Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
A wheel chandelier is also called a ''{{lang|la|corona}}'' (crown) and circular chandelier.&lt;ref name="Crafts"&gt;Julia de Wolf Addison: [http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/102380/18212/www.digilibraries.com@18212@18212-h@18212-h-0.htm Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503014439/http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/102380/18212/www.digilibraries.com%4018212%4018212-h%4018212-h-0.htm |date=2014-05-03 }} Medieval Histories&lt;/ref&gt; Like the later and larger Hezilo chandelier, the Azelin chandelier is a circular hoop of gilt copper and [[tinning|tinplate]], decorated with twelve towers and twelve gatehouses. However, the decoration is much sparser, limited to a [[braid]]ed bar in the middle of the hoop and an [[openwork]] wreath of foliage on the upper edge of the hoop. The twelve gatehouses, to which the ropes holding the chandelier up are attached, are basically rectangular in shape with rounded arches and roofing. It is possible that they once held figures, but these would have had to have been very small and flat. The twelve towers are more elaborate, with a hexagonal groundplan. On the outside there are three niches closed with openwork doors, on the inside there is one niche flanked by two (alternately round or square) towers decorated with battlements and imitation brickwork. The spires of the towers extend above the top of the chandelier's hoop and are alternately round or hexagonal, with openwork windows in imitation of [[roof lantern]]s.

The Azelin chandelier has been repeatedly altered by additions, removals, and repairs over the centuries. The overall image of the [[New Jerusalem]], lit up and floating in the air, which all works of this type present, has been maintained. An important and meticulous restoration of the chandelier was carried out between 1982 and 1989, repairing damage of World War II.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Hildesheim St Antonius Inneres.jpg|thumb|The chandelier in the church of St. Antonius, 2008]]
The Azelin chandelier, named for its supposed donor, the bishop [[Azelin]] (1044–1054) is the predecessor of the Hezilo chandelier, which was probably commissioned by Azelin's successor [[Hezilo of Hildesheim|Hezilo]]. Perhaps the two wheel chandeliers were originally planned as a set, just as they then hung in the cathedral for centuries: the Hezilo chandelier in the nave, the Azelin chandelier (which is about half the size) in the [[choir (architecture)|choir]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The chandeliers were created after the devastating fire of 1046, in which the cathedral of [[Altfrid]] and many nearby buildings in the [[Domhof, Hildesheim|Domhof]] were destroyed. Before this, a gold and silver wheel chandelier, gifted by [[Bernward of Hildesheim]] had hung in the nave. This earlier chandelier was definitely destroyed in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Elbern, ''Dom und Domschatz in Hildesheim'', Königstein 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The chandelier was thought to have been commissioned by Bishop Azelin after this fire, but according to a lost document from the 16th century his predecessor [[Thietmar of Hildesheim]] was the patron.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen"&gt;[http://www.welterbe-niedersachsen.de/content/der-thietmarleuchter-0 Der Thietmarleuchter] Weltkulturerbe in Niedersachsen. Retrieved 9 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear, in that case, how the chandelier survived the fire of 1046.

From 1960, when the cathedral and the adjacent buildings were rebuilt, the chandelier hung in the church of St. Antonius, adjacent to the [[cloisters]] of the cathedral. After the completion of extensive restorations of the cathedral, reopened on 15 August 2014, and the conversion of St. Antonius to a part of the Cathedral museum, the Azelin chandelier was returned to the cathedral and placed again above the altar in the crossing, while the Hezilo chandelier, which hung there before, was returned to its original location in the nave.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen" /&gt;

A '''backup band''' or '''backing band''' is a [[Band (music)|musical ensemble]] that [[Accompaniment|accompanies]] a [[lead singer]] at a live performance or on a [[sound recording|recording]].&lt;ref name="CampbellBrody2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Campbell|author2=James Brody|title=Rock and roll: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=14 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-64295-2|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}} A backup band can also accompany an instrumental soloist, such as a [[lead guitarist]] or solo [[fiddler]], though [[instrumental music|all-instrumental]] performances, with no singing, are not common in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]]. This can either be an established, long-standing group that has little or no change in membership, or it may be an [[ad hoc]] group assembled for a single show or a single recording.{{or|date=September 2017}} Ad hoc or "pickup" groups are often made up of [[session musician]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Bike Arc LLC''', located in downtown [[Palo Alto, California]], is a Silicon Valley startup that designs secure [[bicycle parking rack]]s and systems. It was founded by Joseph Bellomo and Jeff Selzer in 2008. Jeff Selzer sits on the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://bikesiliconvalley.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the General Manager of Palo Alto Bicycles. Joseph Bellomo, a [[California]]-licensed [[architect]], is the founder and owner of [[Joseph Bellomo Architects]], Inc. in Palo Alto, which he founded in 1986. In addition to collaborating on Bike Arc, Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer also worked together on the Palo Alto Bikestation at the [[Caltrain]] depot.

[[File:Umbrella Arc by Bike Arc in downtown Palo Alto, California..jpg|thumb|Umbrella Arc bicycle parking system/bike racks/bicycle storage by Bike Arc.]]

In 2009, the American Institute of Architects, California Council, gave Bike Arc the Honor Award for Small Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Honor Award for Small Projects|url=http://www.aiacc.org/2011/08/02/bike-arc/|publisher=AIACC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer—both being bicycle enthusiasts—set out to design bicycle-parking systems that don't touch and potentially damage bicycles, a solution that prevents bicycles from contacting each other, which can cause wear-and-tear.

== Products ==

Bike Arc is [[patented]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD604207}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the United States and in Europe (Office for Harmonization In the Internal Market), and the company offers multiple iterations of the same fundamental concept: a [[modular]] [[structure]] of [[steel]] arcs. The Bike Arc family includes the Rack Arc, the Half Arc, the Umbrella Arc, the Tube Arc, the Car Arc, the Bus Arc, the House Arc, and the Ad Arc.

All Bike Arc products are manufactured in the United States.

== Installations ==

The City of Palo Alto has purchased and installed multiple Bike Arc products, including numerous Rack Arcs, Half Arcs and Umbrella Arcs, and Bike Arcs are also in public spaces in Boston, Las Vegas, Redwood City, California, and Norfolk, Virginia. They have also been installed at the University of Buffalo and the University of Nebraska, as well as—among others—at Juniper Networks, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., and the Seattle Repertory Theater.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4724">'''Book Art''' is the field of art that involves the creation of works that use or refer to structural and conceptual properties of books. The term also is used to describe works of art produced in this field. These works may contain text and/or images, or may be sculptural. Book art has existed for thousands of years, and can be seen in Egyptian papyri, Chinese, Japanese and Korean scrolls and books, Mesoamerican codices, and in one form or another, through all human history. In an interview within Cathy Courtney's book ''Speaking of Book Art,'' book artist Helen Douglas discusses her knowledge of ''livres d' artiste'' and twentieth-century Russian books as examples of book art from previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Book Art|last=Courtney|first=Cathy|publisher=Anderson-Lovelace|year=1999|isbn=0-9626372-5-4|location=Los Altos Hills, CA|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the interview Douglas continues to write about the genre of Book Art stating that "...you can talk about a "painting" and "sculpture" you should be able to talk about "book"." The term "Book Arts" refers to the creative and craft disciplines used to produce book art, such as printing, printmaking, papermaking, typography and bookbinding. As a field of contemporary art, Book Art has seen an explosive growth since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first= Betty|title= No Longer Innocent: Book Art In America 1960-1980|place= New York|publisher= Granary Books|date= 2005| isbn= 1887123717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s many college Book Art programs have evolved, including MFA programs at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bookarts.ua.edu/about-the-mfa-program/|title=About the MFA Program - Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Mills College in Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/graduate/eng/programs/MFA_in_bookart.php|title=MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing - Book Arts MFA - Mills College|first=Mills College -|last=English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College Book Art Association (CBAA) was founded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/|title=College Book Art Association - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBAA organizes annual conferences, publishes an open access journal titled ''Openings: Studies in Book Art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/page-1492718|title=College Book Art Association - CBAA Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a blog on ''Book Art Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbaa.wildapricot.org/bookarttheory|title=College Book Art Association - Book Art Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several sub-fields within Book Art, including [[Fine press|fine press books]], sculptural [[Book Works|bookworks]], [[Artist's book|artist books]], [[Altered book|altered books]], designer bookbindings, installations and performances. As this entry evolves examples of works in the subfields will be added, as well as a history of book art, and organizations that exhibit, teach and promote book art, such as the Center for Book Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforbookarts.org/|title=The Center for Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in New York City, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnbookarts.org/|title=Minnesota Center for Book Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Minneapolis and the San Francisco Center for the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sfcb.org/|title=San Francisco Center for the Book|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Katherine M. Ruffin's 2017 essay "A Typology for the Structures of Book Arts Programs" describes five different types of organizations that now offer programs in Book Art as Book Arts Programs in Liberal Arts Colleges, Book Arts Programs at Universities, Book Arts Programs at Art Colleges and Universities, Book Arts Programs at Craft Schools, and Book Arts Programs as Independent Not-for-Profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruffin|first=Katherine M.|date=2017|title=A Typology of Structures of Book Arts Programs|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cbaa/index.php/jcbaa/article/view/32/56|journal=Openings|volume=3|pages=36-37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine press Book Art follows in the tradition of the book as precious object. Publishers like [William Morris|William Morris’s] Kelmscott Press from the British [Arts and Crafts movement] was an imporatant precursor to fine press Book Art. Examples of 20th century fine press Book Art include works published by Arron Press and The Gahenna Press. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Books as Art |last= Eaton |first= Timothy A. |publisher= Boca Raton Museum of Art |year=1991 |location= Boca Raton, FL |pages= 10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Breakfast time''''' or '''''Frukostdags''''' is an oil &lt;!-- on canvas --&gt; painting completed in 1887 by the Swedish artist [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]] (1864–1940). It measures {{convert|91|by|87|cm}}{{r|Art project}} and currently belongs to the [[Nationalmuseum]] which bought it in 1910. The image shows a dining table standing in a garden. ''Breakfast time'' is one of the museum's most popular images, mentioned as one of the real pearls of the 1800s.{{r|Citat}}{{r|Sekelskitesparlor}}{{r|Arstiderna}}{{TOC LIMIT|2}}

==Painting==
The painting ''Breakfast time'' played a major role in Hanna Pauli's breakthrough in the Nordic art scene during the late 1880s. She had recently studied in [[Paris]] at the [[Académie Colarossi]] and entered the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1887 with the portrait of her Finnish fellow artist and sculptress Venny Soldan, which is held by the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]].{{r|Konstmuseum}}

An open-air painting, ''Breakfast time'' depicts a tranquil scene with a table set for breakfast on a sunny morning. Placed at the bottom right of the picture is a [[table (furniture)|table]] covered with a white tablecloth alongside a bench and two chairs. It is positioned under a tree with its branches stretching over the table. A maid is approaching the table carrying a [[tray]] in her hands.  The light is reflected from the shiny objects on the table and from the white [[tablecloth]]. The artist has been partly inspired by the impressionists way of suggesting volumes and depth by using coloured lights and shadows, causing the table, the [[table setting]] and the [[leaf|foliage]] to dissolve in shimmering light reflexes. The painting was popular among contemporary Swedish artists of the time.{{r|Frukostdags}}

==Style==
Hanna Pauli had an education of the wealthy middle class that adopted many of the features of noble life in 18th century, such as learning to draw and paint with watercolour. However, she decided to pursue this further and became a professional artist. Many Swedish artists of the time studied at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf art school]] and in Paris, and Pauli was also tutored there. She was mainly influenced by the work of [[Carl Larsson]], [[Peder Severin Krøyer]], [[Laurits Andersen Ring]] and French artists like  [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]. The painting was not as popular among the broad public of the time as it was among her Nordic artist colleagues. The use of light, the vibrant brushwork applied in  intervals, separately from each other without any blending or mixture, and the light spots fields composed by broad brushwork among other things, angered many contemporary Swedish critics. They saw Hanna Pauli's techniques as too radical and a critic derisively pointed out that perhaps the thick paint on the tablecloth was there because the artist was using it to clean and dry her brushes on it.{{r|Frukostdags}}{{sfnp|Gynning|1999|p=45|ps=none}}{{r|Ingelman}}

The painting of ''Breakfast time'' was completed by Hanna Pauli by the summer of 1887; later that year, in the autumn, she became engaged to her future husband, [[Georg Pauli]], who was also an artist. When the painting was completed she was still unmarried, and the  signature is her maiden name. ''Breakfast time'' was exhibited at the World Exhibition [[in Paris]] in 1889 and [[The Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893.{{r|Frukostdags}}{{sfnp|Gynning|1994|pp=746–749|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Brummer|1997|pp=30–68|ps=none}}

'''''Cabaret Scene''''' (1922) is a painting by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. It was a unique [[Cubism|cubist]] experiment that came between Dalí's early [[Impressionism|impressionist]] work and the classic [[Surrealism|surrealist]] technique he would later develop. Dalí was inspired by [[Pablo Picasso]] after he got expelled from the School of Fine Arts in Spain. His inspiration was shown in his paintings, such as this one.

[[File:Sala del crocifisso, cassoni dipinti.JPG|thumb|Some ''cassoni'', in the [[Museo Bardini]], Florence]]
[[File:Arca de la Batalla de Anghiari (M.A.N. 51936) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cassone from the 15th century ([[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|M.A.N.]], [[Madrid]])]]
[[File:Italian - "Cassone" - Walters 6535.jpg|thumb|Walnut ''cassone'' in the form of an Antique [[sarcophagus]], Rome, 16th century ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]

A '''cassone''' (plural ''cassoni'') or '''marriage chest''' is a rich and showy Italian type of [[Chest (furniture)|chest]], which may be inlaid or carved, prepared with [[gesso]] ground then painted and gilded. ''[[Pastiglia]]'' was decoration in low [[relief]] carved or moulded in gesso, and was very widely used. The cassone ("large chest") was one of the trophy furnishings of rich merchants and aristocrats in Italian culture, from the [[Late Middle Ages]] onward. The cassone was the most important piece of furniture of that time. It was given to a bride and placed in the bridal suite. It would be given to the bride during the wedding, and it was the bride's parents' contribution to the wedding.

There are in fact a variety of different terms used in contemporary records for chests, and the attempts by modern scholars to distinguish between them remain speculative, and all decorated chests are today usually called ''cassoni'', which was probably not the case at the time.  For example, a ''forziere'' probably denoted a decorated chest with a lock.&lt;ref&gt;Ajmar-Wollheim, Marta; Dennis, Flora, ''At home in Renaissance Italy'', 2006, Victoria and Albert Museum, {{ISBN|1-85177-488-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85177-488-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since a cassone contained the personal goods of the bride, it was a natural vehicle for painted decoration commemorating the marriage in [[heraldry]] and, when figural painted panels began to be included in the decor from the early ''[[quattrocento]]'', flattering allegory. The side panels offered a flat surface for a suitable painting, with subjects drawn from [[Romance (heroic literature)|courtly romance]] or, much less often, religious subjects.  By the 15th century subjects from classical mythology or history became the most popular. Great Florentine artists of the 15th century were called upon to decorate ''cassoni'', though as [[Vasari]] complains, by his time in the 16th century, artists thought such work beneath them.  Some Tuscan artists in [[Siena]] and Florence specialized in such cassone panels, which were preserved as autonomous works of art by 19th century collectors and dealers, who sometimes discarded the cassone itself. From the late 1850s, neo-Renaissance cassoni were confected for dealers like William Blundell Spence, Stefano Bardini or Elia Volpi in order to present surviving cassone panels to clients in a more "authentic" and glamorous presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Callmann, "William Blundell Spence and the Transformation of Renaissance Cassoni". ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''141''' (June 1999:338–348).&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical place for such a cassone was in a chamber at the foot of a bed that was enclosed in curtains. Such a situation is a familiar setting for depictions of the [[Annunciation]] or the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] of St. Anne to the Virgin Mary. A cassone was largely immovable. In a culture where chairs were reserved for important personages, often pillows scattered upon the floor of a chamber provided informal seating, and a cassone could provide both a backrest and a table surface. The symbolic "humility" that modern scholars read into Annunciations where the Virgin sits reading upon the floor, perhaps underestimates this familiar mode of seating.

At the end of the 15th century, a new classicising style arose, and early [[Renaissance]] cassoni of central and northern Italy were carved and partly gilded, and given classical décor, with panels flanked by fluted corner pilasters, under friezes and cornices, or with sculptural panels in high or low relief. Some early to mid-sixteenth-century cassoni drew their inspiration from Roman [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] (''illustration, right''). By the mid-sixteenth century [[Giorgio Vasari]] could remark on the old-fashioned cassoni with painted scenes, examples of which could be seen in the palazzi of Florentine families.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori''..., ed. G. Milanesi, vol. II p 148,  noted in Ellen Callmann 1999:339 and note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cassone that has been provided with a high panelled back and sometimes a footrest, for both hieratic and practical reasons, becomes a ''cassapanca'' ("chest-bench"). ''Cassapanche'' were immovably fixed in the main public room of a [[palazzo]], the ''sala'' or ''salone.'' They were part of the ''immobili'' ("unmoveables"), perhaps even more than the removable glazed window casements, and might be left in place, even if the palazzo passed to another family.

{{Environmental law}}
'''Clean Tech Law''' contemplates a diverse set of legal and policy issues related to the development and commercialization of [[clean technology]]. These issues range from conventional [[natural resources]] law to cutting-edge [[intellectual property]] issues related to [[synthetic genomics]] and advanced materials.  Clean tech law could also address issues and conflicts surrounding the placement of such technologies (e.g., glare from solar panels).

==History==
The term clean tech, or cleantech, is short for [[clean technology]]. The abbreviated use of the term first appeared on October 10, 1990 in the [[Xinhua General News Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110315064606/http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/60/the-etymology-of-cleantech/ CleanBeta, What is CleanTech?]&lt;/ref&gt; Now, clean tech, is generally considered to include multiple advanced technologies in four economic sectors: [[energy]], [[water]], [[Raw material|material]]s, and [[transportation]]. These technologies break down in the following categories:

* Energy Generation
* Energy Storage
* Energy Infrastructure
* Energy Efficiency
* Transportation
* Water &amp; Wastewater
* Air &amp; Environment
* Materials
* Manufacturing/Industrial
* Agriculture
* Recycling &amp; Waste&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205528/http://cleantechnetwork.com/index.cfm?pageSRC=CleantechDefined Clean Tech Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic issues==
As a discrete legal field, clean tech law is in its infancy and so vaguely defined that it focuses as much on more familiar areas like liability and ownership as it does [[business models]] and corporate strategies. The transactional side of clean tech law revolved around development and commercializing of new technologies in [[renewable energy]], [[pollution]], and other frontiers in the fight against [[climate change]] and protection of natural resources, and the creation of green jobs. In addition, the basic economics are inseparable from substantive social and ethical issues posed by these emerging technologies. The more traditional legal areas of [[clean technology]] law include [[intellectual property]], [[patent law]], licensing, [[litigation]], and federal and state [[legislative]], [[landuse]] and regulatory issues.

 |description=During the period from 1982 to 1988, the coat of arms of Sabah was a [[kingfisher]]. The Sabah state government chose to adopt a state coat of arms that resembled [[Sarawak]]'s hornbill, in memory of the two [[Borneo]] states' common history as vassal states of [[Brunei]] in the pre-British times. Sabah adopted a kingfisher because of its indigenous Bajau sea gypsies, who are politically powerful in the state administration along with the Bruneians from [[Brunei]], identify with the bird to a great extent. Both of the indigenous were traditionally fishermen, and amongst [[Borneo]] natives, birds are considered messengers of the gods. The omen bird for the fishermen is the kingfisher. The majority native tribe, the interior-dwelling [[Kadazan]]s or [[Dusun]]s, identify with the kingfisher to a lesser extent, as the bird is commonly found amongst their main occupational group, the rice farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my-sabah.html|title=Sabah (Malaysia)|author=Ian MacDonald|publisher=CRW Flags|accessdate=25 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525033510/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my-sabah.html|archivedate=25 May 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">With respect to [[cultural heritage]], '''conservation science''' is the interdisciplinary study of conservation of art, architecture, technical art history and other cultural works through the use of scientific inquiry.  General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works; the materials and techniques from which cultural, artist and historic objects are made.

[[Conservation scientist (museums)|Conservation scientists]] use [[scientific methods]] and [[Scientific law|principles]] to support work in the fields of [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]], and care of cultural objects in museums and other collections.  Cultural conservation science work includes identifying the materials that make up a structure or piece of art including their chemical makeup, identifying and cataloging changes that cause deterioration and developing methods to mitigate deterioration of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Italy]], conservation science is considered part of the broader field called '[[Heritage Science]]' which also encompasses scientific aspects less directly related to cultural heritage [[Art conservation|conservation]], as well its management and interpretation. 
&lt;!-- need history section when sources become available --&gt;

There are four broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage:  1) understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, 2) thorough examination and analysis, 3) study of the causes of deterioration, and 4) improving materials and techniques.  Conservation science includes aspects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] as well as [[engineering]].&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Phillip|title=The Nature of Conservation: A Race Against Time|year=1986|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Marina del Rey, CA|isbn=0-941103-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''devotional song''' is a [[hymn]] which accompanies religious observances and rituals. Traditionally devotional music has been a part of [[Christian music]], [[Hindu music]], [[Sufi music]], [[Buddhist music]], [[Islamic music]]  and [[Jewish music]]

Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In the West, the devotional has been a part of the [[liturgy]] in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], church music in general was hotly debated. Some [[Puritan]]s objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.

In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular [[rhythms]] which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a [[mysticism|mystical]] experience. In [[Hindu music]], the genre arising out of the [[Bhakti movement]] (devotion), it takes forms like [[Bhajan]], [[Kirtan]] and [[Aarti]].&lt;ref name="GoswamiThielemann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saurabh Goswami|author2=[[Selina Sharma|Selina Thielemann]]|title=Music and Fine Arts in the Devotional Traditions of India: Worship Through Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEnT57bbZG8C|year= 2005|pages=2–10|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Kīrtana: Traditional South Indian Devotional Songs: Compositions of Tyāgarāja, Muttusvāmi Dīkṣitar and Śyāma Śāstri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI8sygAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-20933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dowse Art Museum''' is a [[municipal art gallery]] in [[Lower Hutt]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/13470/the-dowse |title=The Dowse – Wellington places – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening in 1971 in the Lower Hutt CBD,&lt;ref name='history'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdowse.org.nz/en/Visit/Visiting-The-Dowse/History-and-Culture/ |title=Our History – The Dowse Art Museum |publisher=Newdowse.org.nz |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dowse occupies a stand-alone building adjacent to other municipal facilities. The building was completely remodelled in 2013.&lt;ref name='building'&gt;"The New Dowse Art Museum / Athfield Architects" 19 September 2013. ArchDaily. Accessed 7 November 2013. http://www.archdaily.com/?p=428705&lt;/ref&gt; The Dowse's holdings generally focus on New Zealand artists of both national and local significance.

==History==
The Dowse Art Museum is named after Mayor Percy and Mayoress Mary Dowse, both of whom died prior to the museum opening. Percy Dowse served as the mayor of Hutt City from 1950 to 1970. He was a firm believer in the principle of having physical, social, and cultural facilities in modern cities and he initiated a building phase in the city that saw the construction of landmark buildings such as the War Memorial Library, the Lower Hutt Town Hall, and the Ewen Bridge. He championed the addition of an art gallery to the building spree. His wife, Mary Dowse, was the first president of the Hutt Valley National Council of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Jill|title=The Suffrage Trail|date=1995|publisher=National Council of Women New Zealand (NCWNZ)|location=Wellington|isbn=0-473-03150-7|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an ardent supporter of the arts. She teamed up with Elizabeth Harper from The Hutt Art Society, and the duo lobbied the City Council. They succeeded in their endeavor when, in 1963, the Council agreed to provide space for an art gallery. The gallery was originally housed in an extension of the War Memorial Library but after Mary died in a road accident in 1964 the City Council made a unanimous decision to honor her by constructing a new building for the art gallery. The museum was only partially completed when Percy died in 1970.&lt;ref name="The Dowse Art Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.newdowse.org.nz/en/Visit/Visiting-The-Dowse/History-and-Culture/|publisher=Hutt City Council|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography career==
Fan Ho was born in [[Shanghai]] in 1931, and emigrated with his family to [[Hong Kong]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=SCMP-151117&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1879716/street-life-hong-kong-1950s-seen-through-lens |title=Street Life: Hong Kong in the 1950s as seen through the lens of photographer Fan Ho |author= |date=17 November 2015 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of war in 1941, Ho's parents were stranded in Macau for several years and Ho was left in the care of a family servant.&lt;ref name=VisualDialogues&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.sothebys.com/pdf/2017/HK0758/docs/HK0758.pdf |title=Visual Dialogues: Hong Kong through the lens of Fan Ho |author1=Greene, Sarah |author2=Yan, Jasmine |author3= |date=2017 |publisher=Sotheby's |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho began photographing at a very young age with a [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]] which his father had left at home, and later with a [[Rolleiflex]] [[twin-lens reflex camera]] his father gave him at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HKM-1211 /&gt; Largely self-taught, his photos display a fascination with urban life, explored alleys, slums, markets and streets. Much of his work consists of candid photographs of the street vendors and children only a few years younger than himself.&lt;ref name=SCMP-140810&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1570201/photographer-ho-fans-pictures-old-hong-kong-go-display-new-hotel |title=Street life: Hong Kong in the 1950s as seen through a teenage photographer's lens |author=Nip, Amy |date=10 August 2014 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his images in the family bathtub and soon had built up a significant body of work, chronicling Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s as it was becoming a major metropolitan centre. Ho would use the same Rolleiflex K4A throughout his career.&lt;ref name=PR-201706&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.artsy.net/show/blue-lotus-gallery-fan-ho-visual-dialogues-hong-kong-through-the-lens-of-fan-ho |title=Fan Ho: Visual Dialogues/Hong Kong through the lens of Fan Ho |author= |date=June 2017 |publisher=Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt;

{{quote |text=... I've always believed that any work of art should stem from genuine feelings and understandings ... I didn't work with any sense of purpose. As an artist, I was only looking to express myself. I did it to share my feelings with the audience. I need to be touched emotionally to come up with meaningful works. When the work resonates with the audience, it's a satisfaction that money can't buy. My purpose is simple: I try not to waste my audience's time. [''Laughs''] |author=Ho Fan |source=2014 interview with Edmund Lee&lt;ref name=SCMP-141210 /&gt;}}

Upon seeing Ho's work for the first time in 2006, gallery owner [[Laurence Miller]] commented that "[they] felt like direct descendants of the [[Bauhaus]], yet they were made in Hong Kong. They were abstract and humanistic at the same time."&lt;ref name=studiointernational/&gt;

Ho was a Fellow of the [[Photographic Society of America]], the [[Royal Photographic Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in England, and an Honorary Member of the Photographic Societies of Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluelotus-gallery.com/ho-fan-1/ |title=Ho Fan (1931-2016) |author=Greene, Sarah |date= |publisher=Blue Lotus Gallery |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho was named one of the "Top Ten Photographers of the World" by the Photographic Society of America between 1958 and 1965.&lt;ref name=SCMP-151117 /&gt;

[[File:Approaching Shadow.jpg|thumb|upright|"Approaching Shadow" by Ho, 1954]]
"Approaching Shadow" ({{zh|t=陰影}}) was one of Ho's most famous works. He asked a cousin to pose by a wall at [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Queen's College]] in [[Causeway Bay]] and added a diagonal shadow in the darkroom to symbolize that "her youth will fade away" since "everyone has the same destiny".&lt;ref name=HKM-1211&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/hk-magazine/article/2034956/ho-fan-memory-hong-kongs-iconic-photographer |title=Ho Fan: In Memory of Hong Kong's Iconic Photographer |author=Ho, Fan |date=November 2012 |magazine=HK Magazine |publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A print of "Approaching Shadow" sold for a record {{HK$|375,000}} in 2015.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622 /&gt;

==Film career==
Ho was an accomplished and acclaimed{{cn|date=March 2017}} Hong Kong film director and actor.

He joined [[Shaw Brothers]] in 1961 to develop his career in cinema. He started as a [[continuity editing|continuity assistant]] in the movie ''The Swallow'' (1961)&lt;ref name=HKFDG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hkfilmdirectors.com/en/director/ho-fan |title=何藩 / HO Fan |author= |date=2017 |publisher=Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild |website=The Ultimate Guide to HK Film Directors |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved on to act in several movies for Shaw. Ho won praise for his performance as the Monk, Tripitaka, in the lavish Shaw Brothers adaption of [[List of media adaptations of Journey to the West#Films|''Journey to the West'' four-picture cycle of films]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} Ho became disillusioned with Shaw's revenue-driven formula, and sought creative relief in photography and in other studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/2/9/15/n215710.htm |title=華藝攝影學會三十五週年華誕 |trans-title=The 30th Anniversary of The Chinatown Photographic Society |author=卞克 |date=15 September 2002 |newspaper=Epoch Times |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s he also produced a pioneering{{cn|date=July 2017}} series of independent short films, the first of which, ''Big City Little Man'' (大都市 小人物; 1963, 30 min), won the "Honor Award Certificate" from the Japan International Film Festival in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/en_US/web/hkfa/publications_souvenirs/pub/topicalvolumes/topicalvolumes_detail02.html |title=i-Generations: Independent, experimental and alternative creations from the 60s to now |editor=Fung, May |publisher=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]] |date=2001 |isbn=962-8050-13-3 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=People tell me it seems my photographic works have stories, have some drama. That’s why, later on, I became a film director. Both use images to tell their story, to express the emotions of the author. Photography and filmmaking are like sisters. One is still and one is moving—that is the only difference. |author=Ho Fan |source=2012 ''HK Magazine'' article&lt;ref name=HKM-1211 /&gt;}}

Ho left Shaw Brothers in 1969 to develop his career as a director, making over 20 films with various studios in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He has had three films in the "Official Selection" of the [[Cannes Film Festival|International Film Festivals of Cannes]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]] and [[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]]; and five of his films have been selected in the "Permanent Collection" of the National Film Archives of Taiwan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=HKFDG /&gt; As well as his independent film work he is acclaimed for pioneering the erotic field ([[Hong Kong motion picture rating system|Category III films]]) in cinema, with such cult{{cn|date=July 2017}} films as ''Adventure in Denmark'' (1973), ''The Girl with the Long Hair'' (1975) and the highly successful ''Temptation Summary'' (1990).

According to Mark Pinsukanjana, director of Modernbook Gallery in San Francisco, CA, his debut feature, ''Lost'' (1969), was Ho's favourite. As Pinsukanjana says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''Lost'', one will see the chaotic life of one man in Hong Kong. The film follows him and finds the beauty that surrounds him; he is lost because he never saw it. I think that one can say that this is similar to Fan Ho's photographs in the sense that Hong Kong is crowded, busy and chaotic to many, but for Fan Ho, he was able to convert [what he found] and find beauty."&lt;ref name=studiointernational&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/stillness-in-motion-the-photographs-of-fan-ho/ |title=Stillness in Motion: The Photographs of Fan Ho |author=Di Marzo, Cindi |publisher=Studio-international.co.uk |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also served on the jury of the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]] Festival and [[Hong Kong Film Award]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Post-retirement career==
[[File:Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition view 2017.jpg|200px|thumb|Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery Fan Ho Exhibition in 2017]]
Ho's wife and children emigrated to [[San Jose, California]] in 1979 to pursue a university education&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt; and he followed in 1995 after retiring from cinema.&lt;ref name=SCMP-160622&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/1979279/ho-fan-celebrated-1950s-hong-kong-street-photographer-dies |title=Ho Fan, celebrated 1950s Hong Kong street photographer, dies in California |author=Cheung, Rachel |date=22 June 2016 |newspaper=South China Morning Post |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restless in retirement, Ho's health began to decline until his family suggested that he pursue photography again. Rather than using modern equipment and taking photographs locally in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Ho went through his old negatives from Hong Kong and began showing his portfolio to local galleries.&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620 /&gt;

He exhibited slides of his photographs, some of which were in the permanent collection at [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|SFMOMA]], at the 1998 New Asian Cinema Festival, which was screening his 1988 film ''Carnal Desire'' at the 4 Star Theater in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Carnal-Desire-spiritual-journeys-3089238.php |title="Carnal Desire," spiritual journeys |author=Johnson, G.

Modernbook went on to stage his vintage work at photoLA in January 2006, and upon seeing his photographs of Hong Kong, fellow gallery owner Laurence Miller was moved to acquire 26 prints and put on a solo exhibit for Ho in New York City later that year.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; Ho would go on to publish a new monograph, ''Hong Kong Yesterday'' in 2006 after receiving international attention for this early work.&lt;ref name=studiointernational /&gt; By compositing old negatives, Ho continued to produce new prints of scenes that have now vanished from modern Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=SCMP-140810 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN-131030 /&gt; Many of the resulting composited prints were published for the first time in his final monograph ''A Hong Kong Memoir'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=SCMP-141210&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1656431/inquisition-ho-fan-photographer |title=Ho Fan, Hong Kong photographer, on retrieving lost memories |interviewer=Edmund Lee |subject=Ho Fan |date=10 December 2014 |publisher=South China Morning Post |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following exhibits of the same title at Modernbook in summer 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-hos-hong-kong-snapshots-bear-playful-theatricality/Content?oid=2178470 |title=Fan Ho's Hong Kong snapshots bear playful theatricality |author=Archer, Larissa |date=21 July 2011 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from December 2014 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/fan-ho-photos-bring-mid-century-hong-kong-to-life/Content?oid=2915055 |title=Fan Ho photos bring mid-century Hong Kong to life |author=Katz, Anita |date=25 December 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of Hong Kong'' 《舊香港人的舊》 contains 153 new street photographs which were selected from 500 negatives chosen by Ho before he died in 2016. After his death, the surviving family members spent about a year completing the project, together with support from Sarah Greene (Blue Lotus Consultancy) and WE Press (香港人出版). 20 quotable excerpts from Ho's earliest book, ''Thoughts on Street Photography'' 《街頭攝影叢談》, were included. These 153 photographs provide not only glimpses of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s but also recall the indomitable spirit of the people at the time&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP-170620&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2098441/how-fan-ho-hong-kongs-poet-camera-found-his|title=How Fan Ho, Hong Kong's poet with a camera, found his calling - in his own words|last=Heaver|first=Stuart|date=June 20, 2017|work=Post Magazine, South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zolimacitymag.com/hong-kong-revisited-through-the-eyes-of-the-late-street-photographer-fan-ho/|title=Hong Kong Revisited Through the Eyes of the Late Street Photographer Fan Ho|last=Karacs|first=Sarah|date=June 13, 2017|work=Zolima Citymag|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body of realistic street photographs were never highly recognized during 1950s and 1960s, despite being Ho's favorites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/hongkong/lifestyle/never-seen-snaps-old-hong-kong-legendary-photographer-fan-ho-go-show/|title=Never-seen-before snaps of 'old Hong Kong' from legendary photographer Fan Ho to go on show|last=Hong Kong|first=Coconuts|date=|website=Coconuts Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as quoted in Ho’s reply to Sarah Greene during one of her visits to Ho in early 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''First Things First''' manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by [[Ken Garland]]. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of [[Tony Benn]], radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by [[critical theory]], the [[Frankfurt School]] and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a [[Humanism|Humanist]] dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]].

'''French porcelain''' has a history spanning a period from the 17th century to the present. The French were heavily involved in the early European efforts to discover the secrets of making the [[hard-paste porcelain]] known from [[Chinese export porcelain|Chinese]] and [[Japanese export porcelain]].  They succeeded in developing [[soft-paste porcelain]], but [[Meissen porcelain]] was the first to make true hard-paste, around 1710, and the French took over 50 years to catch up with Meissen and the other German factories. 

But by the 1760s, [[kaolin]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]], and the relocated royal-owned [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres factory]] took the lead in European porcelain design as [[rococo]] turned into what is broadly known as the [[Louis XVI style]] and then the [[Empire style]].  French styles were soon being imitated in porcelain in Germany, England, and as far afield as Russia.  They were also imitated in the cheaper French [[faience]], and this and other materials elsewhere.  This dominance lasted until at least 1830.  

Before the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, French production was complicated by various royal [[patent]]s and [[monopoly|monopolies]] restricting the production of various types of wares, which could sometimes be circumvented by obtaining the "protection" of a member of the royal family or senior courtier; this might or might not involve ownership by them. 

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, France had a vigorous [[faience]] industry, making high-quality [[tin-glazed]] earthenware that remained in touch with artistic fashion.  At least before 1800, this catered to the lower end of the market very successfully, so that porcelain factories concentrated on the top end, in France and elsewhere.  Compared to other European countries, French manufacturers have generally concentrated on tablewares and decorative vessels rather than figures, with [[Mennecy-Villeroy porcelain]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  Where figures and groups were produced, these were most often in the French invention of unglazed [[biscuit porcelain]].

==Soft-paste blue-and-white porcelain==
{{main|Blue and white porcelain}}

[[File:Rouen porcelain mustard cup end of the 17th century arms of Asselin de Villequiers.jpg|thumb|[[Rouen manufactory|Rouen soft-paste porcelain]], the first French porcelain, end of the 17th century.]]
[[Chinese porcelain]] had long been imported from [[China]], and was a very expensive and desired luxury. Chinese porcelains were treasured, collected from the time of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and sometimes adorned with elaborate mountings of precious metal to protect them and enhance their beauty. Huge amounts especially of [[silver]] were sent from Europe to China&lt;ref&gt;Credit being unavailable or unmanageable in the East, "in the end, the Europeans had to have recourse to precious metals, particularly American silver, which was the 'open sesame' of these trades", observes Fernand Braudel, ''The Perspective of the World'' (''Civization &amp; Capitalism'', vol. III) :217; cf. section 'Gold and silver: strength or weakness?' p. 490f.&lt;/ref&gt; to pay for the desired Chinese porcelain wares, and numerous attempts were made to duplicate the material.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA240 ''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.240]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at the [[Nevers manufactory]] that Chinese-style [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white wares]] were produced for the first time in France, with production running between 1650 and 1680.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&amp;pg=PA38 ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art'' Gerald W. R. Ward p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese styles would then be taken up by factories in [[Normandy]], especially following the foundation of the [[French East India Company]] in 1664.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

The first soft-paste porcelain in France was developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese [[hard-paste porcelain]],&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; and follow the attempts of [[Medici porcelain]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vhw-EQVViHMC&amp;pg=PA193 ''Hydrocolloid applications: gum technology in the food and other industries'' A.

L. Solon, "The Rouen Porcelain", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs,'' '''7''' No. 26 (May 1905:116-124) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The soft porcelain used blue designs of the type already used in the faiences of the period.&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; Dr. [[Martin Lister]] reported from his voyage to Paris, printed in 1698, that a manufacture of porcelain "as white and translucid as the one that came from the East" was in full operation at [[Saint-Cloud porcelain|Saint-Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;Lister, ''Relation of a Journey to Paris'', London, 1698, noted in Solon 1905:116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French lexicographer [[Jacques Savary des Brûlons]] wrote in 1722 about these first experiments in his ''Dictionnaire universel du commerce'':

''"Fifteen or twenty years ago an attempt was made in France to copy Chinese porcelain : the first attempts made in Rouen were quite successful, (...) these faience objects from new factories are not ranked as French faience - this is the genuine porcelain invented by the French during the last few years and manufactured successively in Rouen, Passy near Paris, and then in Saint Cloud."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyrillefroissart.com/fr/fiche.php3?id_article=1838 Faïences et porcelaines du XVIème au XIXème siècle]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] set up the [[Royal Factory of Saint-Cloud]] in 1664 in order to make copies (In the original ''"Contre-façons"'', i.e. "Fakes") of "Indian-style" porcelain.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; Saint-Cloud became a very important manufactory for the new wares.

However, once French manufacturers discovered how to produce a much wider range of colours in porcelain by the 1730s, using [[overglaze]] "enamel" decoration, they abandoned [[underglaze]] blue more quickly and thoroughly than those of other European countries - some English factories continued to make a significant proportion of blue and white wares until the end of the century and beyond.

Louis XIV had received 1,500 pieces of porcelain from the [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Siamese Embassy to France]] in 1686, but the manufacturing secret had remained elusive.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; 

France finally discovered the Chinese technique of [[hard-paste porcelain]] through the efforts of the [[Jesuit]] Father [[François Xavier d'Entrecolles]] between 1712 and 1722.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"&gt;Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina (2008) ''Orientalism in Early Modern France'', {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}, Berg Publishing, Oxford, p.220''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; The letters sent to Father Orry in Paris were first published by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]] in 1735, with English editions appearing in 1736 or 1738.&lt;ref name="Needham 37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mabcHwmAD5oC&amp;pg=PA37 ''Ceramic technology'' by Rose Kerr, Nigel Wood, Joseph Needham p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were later again published by Abbé [[Jean-Baptiste Grosier]] in his ''General Description of China''.&lt;ref name="Marryat"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QrRCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA190 ''A history of pottery and porcelain: mediæval and modern'' by Joseph Marryat p.190]&lt;/ref&gt; D'Entrecolles also sent material specimens to Europe, which were analysed by [[Réaumur]], and led to the establishment of the [[Sèvres Manufactory]] once equivalent materials were found in Europe.&lt;ref name="Marryat"/&gt;

After 1730, polychrome porcelain also came to be produced, often in imitation of Chinese polychrome styles of porcelain, such as the "[[Famille rose]]" types. The Japanese ''[[Kakiemon]]'' style of [[Arita porcelain]], [[Japan]], known as "Fleurs indiennes" ("Flowers of the Indies") was also used as an inspiration, especially in [[Saint-Cloud porcelain]] and [[Chantilly porcelain]]. A patent granted to the Chantilly factory in 1735 by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] specifically describes the right to make porcelain ''façon de Japon'' ("in imitation of the porcelain of Japan").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jGsVHV098K0C&amp;pg=PA223 ''The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts'' Gordon Campbell p.223]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the manufacturing technique of soft-paste porcelain seems to have been transmitted to England by French [[Huguenot]] refugees. The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the [[Royal Society]] in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3itNPs2omK0C&amp;pg=PA92 ''18th-Century English Porcelain'' by George Savage, p.92]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of original French designs==

After this initial period, up to the end of the 18th century, French porcelain manufactories would progressively abandon their Chinese and Japanese designs, to become more French in character.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes soft-paste porcelain]] started to display original French inspiration towards its last years of operation, after which the abundant, varied, and original productions of [[Sèvres porcelain]] continued the trend.  [[Biscuit porcelain]] was first used at Vincennes in 1751 by the director [[Jean-Jacques Bachelier]]; this simply involved not glazing or painting the piece after a single firing, leaving a matt surface resembling marble.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108&lt;/ref&gt;  But the pieces had to be perfect, as there was no glaze to cover up faults, so in practice the wastage made them more expensive to produce. Brilliant new colours were developed at Vincennes and Sèvres in the 1750s and 1760s, especially a blue and a rose.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; These were often shown off as the ground colour of the body, with painted decoration within compartments left with a white ground. 

In 1756 the Vincennes factory was moved to [[Sèvres]], where it still remains in production, and in 1759 it was bought by the king, although his mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]] was allowed effective free reign to oversee it. A period of superb quality in both design and production followed, creating much of the enduring reputation of French porcelain. The light-hearted Rococo was given a more serious air, often by restricting it to the painting, rather than the porcelain shape.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

Porcelain production further developed with [[Limoges porcelain]], a type of [[hard-paste porcelain]] produced by factories near the city of [[Limoges]], [[France]]. The manufacturing of hard-paste porcelain in Limoges was established in 1771 following the discovery of local supplies of [[kaolin]] and a material similar to [[petuntse]] in the economically distressed area at [[Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche]], near Limoges.  In parallel, soft-paste porcelain continued to be manufactured however, as it was less expensive to produce.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nast porcelain]] (1783-1835) and [[Dihl and Guérhard porcelain|Dihl and Guérhard]] (1781-1828) were two of a number of factories making very high-quality porcelain in Paris in the decades around 1800.  This contrasted with London, where the factories had all closed or removed north by 1775, although the capital remained, like Paris, a centre for decorating plain "blanks" made elsewhere - in France often in [[Limoges porcelain]].  [[Dagoty and Honoré]] and Darte were other Paris factories.  By 1830 most factories had closed or moved to Limoges.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire style==
Even before the French revolution, the initially severe style of Neoclassicism had begun to turn grandiose and ornate in goods for the courts of the [[Ancien Régime]].  This trend deepened with the rise of Napoleon, which followed a difficult period for French porcelain factories. The [[Empire style]] was marked by lavish [[gilding]], strong colours, and references to military conquests; Napoleon's ultimately unsuccessful expedition to [[Egypt]] sparked a fashion for "Neo-Egyptian" wares.

In 1800 Napoleon, as Minister of the Interior, appointed [[Alexandre Brongniart]] director at Sèvres; he was to stay 47 years, making many changes. The factory concentrated on tableware and larger decorative pieces such as vases and table centrepieces, much of it for the government to use or give as diplomtic presents.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==19th-century==
The Empire style grew more elaborate and ostentatious as the century continued, developing most aspects of "Victorian" taste in a French style. Under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] from 1852-70, there was a revival of Louis XVI style at Sèvres, often more heavily painted and gilded.  Many of the old moulds which the factory had kept were used again.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  

Apart from Sèvres, most factories had moved to [[Limoges]] by about 1830, with many companies making [[Limoges porcelain]], of which [[Haviland &amp; Co.]] was the most sccessful. This was founded in the 1840s by porcelain importers in America, and a strong market in America supported them through rough patches.  They also led a reconnection of ceramics with contemporary trends in the fine arts, especially [[Japonisme]], using artists such as [[Ernest Chaplet]] (though much of his work was in [[stoneware]] rather than porcelain) and [[Félix Bracquemond]].  Around Paris the factory of Jacob Petit at [[Fontainebleau]] opened in 1834, and the questionable career of [[Edmé Samson]] began in the same decade.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sèvres porcelain manufactory, Pot-pourri vases, 1761 at Waddesdon Manor (cropped).jpg|thumb|The three 'boat shaped' potpourri vases that are located at [[Waddesdon Manor]], 1761. ]]
Sèvres turned to a more diluted version of Japonisme after 1870, and in 1897, a new artistic director, A. Sandier, introduced new [[Art Nouveau]] styles, followed about a decade later by styles leading to [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The display of Sèvres porcelain in the English Country House is another by-product of the 19th century and flourishes especially within what is known as 'Rothschildshire' (the county of [[Buckinghamshire]]). The family's history of collecting and its development of the distinctive ‘[[goût Rothschild]]’ (Rothschild style) results in some of the most iconic Sèvres being located at [[Waddesdon Manor]], [[Ferdinand de Rothschild|Baron de Rothschild's]] weekend 'pleasure house'. As Mark Girouard denotes, "opulence was the key-note of this"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/695587648|title=A hundred years at Waddesdon|last=1931-|first=Girouard, Mark,|date=1998|publisher=Rothschild Waddesdon|isbn=0952780925|location=Buckinghamshire, U.K.|oclc=695587648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus "eighteenth-century French furniture, porcelain and bronzes of superb quality combined"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dominated this specific 19th-century collection. Ferdinand's first purchase of Sèvres is a poignant narrative at Waddesdon manor, in which at 21 years old, he treated himself to the famous turquoise Sèvres 'boat shaped' potpourri vase "which he bought in instalments and is still at Waddesdon"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">{{History of Greek art}}

The most important artistic movement of [[Greek art]] in the 19th century was [[academic realism]], often called in Greece "the [[Munich School]]" ({{lang-el|Σχολή του Μονάχου}}) because of the strong influence from the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Munich]] ({{lang-de|Münchner Akademie der Bildenden Künste}}),&lt;ref name=pit&gt;[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/bank/Exhibition_Vlachos.asp Bank of Greece - Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624035222/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/bank/Exhibition_Vlachos.asp |date=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where many Greek artists trained.  The Munich School painted the same sort of scenes in the same sort of style as Western European academic painters in several countries, and did generally not attempt to incorporate Byzantine stylistic elements into their work.

== History ==
The creation of [[romanticism|romantic art]] in [[Greece]] can be explained mainly due to the particular relationships that were created between recently liberated Greece (1830) and [[Bavaria]] during [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]]'s years (''See'':[[Kingdom of Greece]]). In this period the [[Greek state]] was encouraging young artists to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Munich]] and in particular study [[painting]].&lt;ref name=kat&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.gr/html/en/ektheseis/paris_athens.htm New Page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities existed for young artist in Greece itself, immediately after independence, so studying abroad was imperative for them. Munich was an important international center for the arts and was the place where the majority of Greek artists of the 19th century would choose to study; a minority would go to [[Paris]]. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry, giving birth to the Greek "Munich School" of painting. Many of these young artists later returned to Greece to teach at the [[Polytechnic School]] and later [[Athens School of Fine Arts]], where they would transmit their artistic experiences. Some of them, like [[Nikolaus Gysis]], chose to remain in Munich, the so-called ''Athens on the [[Isar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.auth.gr/teloglion/exhibitions/munich/munich.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic styles ==

The works of the Munich school painters are characterized by an expert but over-use of colours that would overshadow the figures' expressions. Scenes were depicted in a pompous and theatrical way, although not lacking in emotional tension. In [[academic realism]] the imperative is the [[ethography]], the representation of urban and/or rural life with a special attention in the depiction of architectural elements, the traditional cloth and the various objects. Munich School painters were specialized on [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[landscape painting]] and [[still life]].

== Representative artists ==
[[Image:Eros and the painter - gysis.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Nikolaus Gysis]], ''Eros and the Painter''.]]

Artists belonging to the Munich School include the first painters of free Greece, such as [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] (1814–1878) and [[Dionysios Tsokos]] (1820–1862). (According to other art critics, he belongs more to the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]). Both of them draw their subjects from the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821, focusing on idealised ideas on the [[Greek Revolution]] and not giving much attention to the violent and tragic aspects of a war. Even more dramatic in their depictions were the later [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] (1837–1907) and [[Ioannis Altamouras]] (1852–1878), who were focused more on the naval battles of the [[1821 Revolution]].&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

Main representatives of the artistic movement were apart from [[Konstantinos Volanakis|Volanakis]] the painters who worked mainly during the second half of the 19th century like [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] (1832–1904), [[Nikolaos Gysis]] (1842–1901), [[Georgios Iacovidis]]. (1853–1907), and [[Georgios Roilos]] (1867–1928). In his mature career Roilos went beyond the principles of the Munich School and introduced impressionism into Greek painting. [[Nikolaos Gysis|Gysis]] stayed at the Academy in Germany while the others have returned to teach at the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]]. Their teaching and artistry have marked the 19th-century artistic era in Greece.&lt;ref name=kat/&gt;

[[Nikiphoros Lytras]] is considered the pope of Greek painting and the major iconographer of Greek life during the 19th century. Paintings such as ''The milkman'' or ''The awaiting'' consist reference points in [[Greek art]]. [[Nikolaos Gysis|Gysis]] worked mainly on [[ethography]] while at the maturity of his career he shifted towards the iconography of visions, allegories and symbolisms. [[Georgios Iacovidis|Iacovidis]] paintings were mainly [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and depiction of children scenes. The latter was the founder and first curator of the [[National Gallery of Greece]] in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

Other painters include [[Epameinondas Thomopoulos]], [[Ioannis Koutsis]], [[Stylianos Miliadis]], [[Nikolaos Vokos]], [[Ioannis Zacharias]] (1845–?) and [[Polychronis Lembesis]]. Influences of [[academic realism]] can also be seen in the work of many Greek artists such as [[Spyridon Vikatos]] (1878–1960), [[Nikolaos Davis]] (1883-1967), [[Thalia Flora-Karavia]] (1871–1960), [[Ioannis Doukas]] (1841-1916) and [[Ektor Doukas]] (1886–1969).&lt;ref name=kat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Towards the formation of a professional identity: women artists in Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century'' (2005) Chariklia-Glafki Gotsia [[Women's History Review]], 14;pp: 285 - 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the movement started when some Greek painters after the mid-19th century such as [[Periclis Pantazis]] (1849–1884) departed from academic realism towards impressionism and the final end occurred when expressionist [[Nikolaos Lytras]] (1883–1927), Georgios Roilos, and [[Konstantinos Parthenis]] (1878–1967) started to teach at the Athens School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=pit/&gt;

A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

'''Hardstone carving''' is a general term in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] for the artistic carving of predominantly semi-precious stones (but also of [[gemstone]]s), such as [[jade]], rock crystal (clear [[quartz]]), [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], or [[carnelian]], and for an object made in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CAMEO database: Hardstone|publisher=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] |url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Hardstone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610180653/http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Hardstone|archivedate=10 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author =Carvalho, Pedro de Moura|year=2010|title=Gems and Jewels of Mughal India|publisher=Nour Foundation|location=London|isbn=978-1-874780-72-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the objects are small, and the category overlaps with both [[jewellery]] and [[sculpture]]. Hardstone carving is sometimes referred to by the Italian term ''pietre dure'';&lt;ref&gt;''This catalogue provides a comprehensive history of pietre dure, a virtuoso form of hardstone carving that reached an artistic peak in Italy in the 16th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe.'' {{Cite book|editor1=Giusti, Annamaria |editor2=Koeppe, Wolfram |year=2008|title=Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art in association with Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-288-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''[[pietra dura]]'' (with an "a") is the common term used for stone inlay work, which causes some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;That confusion is a good reason for not using the term ''pietre dure''.{{Citation needed|reason=opinion|date=June 2014}} See ''[[pietra dura]]'' for more on the distinction.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Neolithic period]] until about the 19th century such objects were among the most highly prized in a wide variety of cultures, often attributed special powers or religious significance, but today coverage in non-specialist art history tends to be relegated to a catch-all [[decorative arts]] or "minor arts" category. The types of objects carved have included those with ritual or religious purposes, [[engraved gems]] as [[signet ring]]s and other kinds of [[seal (insignia)|seal]], handles, [[belt hook]]s and similar items, vessels and purely decorative objects.

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Dish of [[serpentinite|serpentine]] with inlaid gold fish, 1st century BCE or CE, with 9th-century mounts]]
Hardstone carving falls under the general category of [[glyptic art]], which covers small carvings and [[sculpture]] in all categories of stone. The definition in this context of "[[hardstone]]" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes "soft" stones such as [[soapstone]] (steatite) and [[mineral]]s such as [[alabaster]], both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and [[monumental sculpture]], such as [[marble]] and other types of [[limestone]], and [[sandstone]]. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, "hard stone" and "soft stone" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as [[granite]], are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as [[malachite]] are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour.

Essentially, any stone that is often used in jewellery is likely to count as a hardstone. Hard organic minerals such as [[amber]] and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] are included, as well as the [[mineraloid]] [[obsidian]]. Hardstones normally have to be drilled rather than worked with edged tools to achieve a fine finish. [[Geology|Geologically]] speaking, most of the gemstones traditionally carved in the West are varieties of [[quartz]], including: [[chalcedony]], [[agate]], [[amethyst]], [[sard]], [[onyx]], [[carnelian]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], [[jasper]], and quartz in its uncoloured and transparent form, known as rock crystal. The various materials called jade have been dominant in East Asian and [[Mesoamerica]]n carving. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. For example, in the [[Uruk period]] of [[Sumerian culture]] (4th millennium BCE) heavy vases, cups and [[ewer]]s of [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] have been found,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfort|1970|pages=28&amp;ndash;31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were not for common use, as the people of [[Uruk]] had well-developed [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Behnam Abu alsouf|Abu Al-Soof, Bahnam]] |year=1985|title=Uruk Pottery: Origin and distribution|publisher=State Organization of Antiquities and Heritage, Ministry of Culture and Information, Republic of Iraq|location=Baghdad|oclc=17476966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jade disk.JPG|thumb|left|300px|[[Han Dynasty]] jade ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'']]

===Asia and the Islamic world===
{{further|Pietra dura}}

The art is very ancient, going back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and beyond, and major traditions include [[cylinder seal]]s and other small carvings in the Ancient [[Near East]], which were also made in softer stones. Inlays of semi-precious stones were often used for decoration or highlights in sculptures of other materials, for example statues often had eyes inlaid with white shell and blue [[lapis lazuli]] or another stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ebish-Il_Louvre_AO17551.jpg Louvre], Sumerian example, c. 2400 BCE&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese jade]] carving begins with the carving of ritual objects, including blades for ''[[ji (halberd)|ji]]'' and [[dagger-axe]]s clearly never intended for use, and the "Six Ritual Jades" including the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' and ''[[cong (jade)|cong]]'', which according to much later literature represented heaven and earth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter IV on the six ritual jades, Chapter V on blades&lt;/ref&gt; These are found from the [[Neolithic]] [[Liangzhu culture]] (3400-2250 BCE) onwards, and blades from the 2nd millennium BCE [[Shang Dynasty]] on.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Chinese culture attaches strong powers to jade; the [[jade burial suit]]s in which aristocrats of the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) were buried were intended to preserve the body from decay.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Henessey, Chapter II on ''The Significance of Jade''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ewer birds Louvre MR333.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fatimid]] carved rock crystal ewer, c. 1000, with 11th-century Italian lid.]]

The Chinese and other cultures often attributed specific properties for detecting and neutralizing [[history of poison|poison]] to gemstones, a belief still alive in the European [[Renaissance]], as shown by the works of [[Georgius Agricola]], the "father of [[mineralogy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=poison+gemstone&amp;ei=Xqm6SvHiA4XgywSgscnvDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Natura Fossilium''], Book l.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "jade" derives (via the Spanish ''piedra de ijada'') from the [[Aztec]] belief that the mineral cured ailments of the [[kidney]]s and sides.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Han period also saw the beginning of the tradition of fine decorative jade carving which has lasted until modern times, though the fine carving of other hardstones did not develop until the 17th century, and then appears to have been produced in different workshops and styles from those for jade.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 77, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lYYvsRdxsX4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Hardstone+carving+Watson+China&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=6DS5Sum2MIjSMrLAibEP#v=onepage&amp;q=Hardstone%20carving%20Watson%20China&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; In general whiteish [[nephrite]] jade was the most highly regarded in China until about 1800, when the deeper and brighter green of the best [[jadeite]] became more highly favoured. There are related Asian traditions of [[Korean jade carving]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and, to a much lesser extent, [[Japan]].

Smallish [[Sassanian]] carvings are known, mostly for seals or jewellery; the central medallion of the "Cup of [[Chosroes]]" (gallery) is one of the largest. [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian carving]] of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. In 1062 the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was looted by his mercenaries, and the examples found in European treasuries, like the one illustrated, may have been acquired as the booty was dispersed. The rock crystal used in Egypt was apparently traded from [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently it was thought that jade carving was introduced to the central Asian Islamic world in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] period, but it is becoming clearer that archers' [[thumb ring]]s, knife hilts, and various other objects had been carved for centuries, even millennia before, though in limited numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, 193-99&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic jades and other carvings reached a particular peak in the [[Mughal Empire]], where apart from portable carvings inlaid [[pietra dura|panels of carved stones]] were included in buildings such as the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref&gt;Markel&lt;/ref&gt; The great wealth of the Mughal court allowed [[precious stone]]s like [[ruby|rubies]] and [[emerald]]s to be inset freely in objects. The court workshops of the [[Ottoman Empire]] also produced lavish and elaborate objects, in similar styles but without reaching the artistic peaks of Mughal carving.&lt;ref&gt;There are several examples in: Rogers J.M. and Ward R.M.; ''Süleyman the Magnificent'', 1988, 136-9, British Museum Publications {{ISBN|0-7141-1440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western traditions===
[[File:Coupe des Ptolémées 01.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Cup of the Ptolemies]] in [[onyx]], probably [[Alexandria]], 1st century BCE or CE.]]
From the early civilizations of the near East descended the carving of vessels and small statues in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and subsequent Western art, and also [[Sassanian]] [[Persia]]; however it is not very significant in the [[art of ancient Egypt]], outside jewellery, as [[alabaster]] was a more common material. The jade signet ring of [[Tutankhamun]] has been called a "unique specimen" of Egyptian jade.&lt;ref&gt;If it is indeed jade, as seems to be the case. see Keene, 194-5&lt;/ref&gt; Hardstone carving more often refers to vessels and figures than smaller [[engraved gem]]s for [[seal ring]]s or made as [[objéts d'art]], which were the main artistic expression of hardstone carving in the Greek classical and Hellenistic periods, and are regarded separately. From the Hellenistic period elaborate vessels in semi-precious stone begin to appear, mostly carved, some in cameo. The [[Cup of the Ptolemies]] and [[Farnese Cup]] both appear to have been made in [[Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], as does a simpler fluted [[sardonyx]] cup in Washington which, like the Cup of the Ptolemies, was adapted to be a Christian [[chalice (cup)|chalice]], and given elaborate gold and jewelled mounts by [[Abbot Suger]] for his [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]] about 1140.&lt;ref&gt;The mounts of the Cup of the Ptolemies were lost in the French Revolution; other hardstone treasures from St Denis are in the [[Louvre]]. For a full catalogue description of the Washington cup, see Luchs, 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Late Antique plainer shapes for vessels appear, concentrating on showing the natural patterns of figured stones - survivals of these are hard to date, and mostly have survived in church treasuries with medieval mounts in goldsmith work. The best collection of Byzantine liturgical vessels is in the Treasury of [[San Marco, Venice]], some of them booty from the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Angold, 252 &amp; 254 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NkvZWO3CymoC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=Treasury+of+St+Mark+Venice&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=f3S6SuyLIZiwMoiS3cAP# Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]]ists maintained a tradition throughout the Middle Ages, often working in clear rock crystal. There are a few large pieces from [[Carolingian art]], including the [[Lothair Crystal]], and then a continuing tradition of rock crystal work, often used undecorated in reliquaries and other pieces in the same way as modern glass, for which they are often mistaken by modern viewers. By the end of the Middle Ages a wider variety of stones and objects are seen, used for both religious objects and secular ones.

The [[Opificio delle pietre dure]] ("Hardstone workshop") founded by the Medici in [[Florence]] in 1588 soon became the leading workshop in Europe, and developed the [[pietra dura]] style of multi-coloured [[inlay]]s, which use coloured marbles as well as gemstones. They also produced vessels and small sculptures from a single piece of stone, often mounted with gold, which was also a speciality of [[Milan]]ese workshops.&lt;ref&gt;See external link to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]exhibition feature.&lt;/ref&gt; Other rulers followed their example, including [[Peter the Great]], whose [[Peterhof Lapidary Works]], founded in 1721, began the passion among Russian royalty and aristocrats for hardstones. Engraved gem production had already revived, centred on [[Venice]] but with artists in many countries, and gems of very high quality continued to be produced until the mid-19th century. The [[Mannerist]] court taste of the 16th century delighted in extravagant vessels for serving fruit or sweetmeats, or display as table centrepieces or on sideboards, with hardstones augmented with mounts and bases in precious metal, [[enamel paint|enamel]] and jewels. One collection that has remained mostly together is the "Dauphin's Treasure" of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)]], which passed to his son [[Philip V of Spain]]; over 120 objects are now displayed together in the [[Museo del Prado]], many of which were already over a century old in the Dauphin's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/the-decorative-arts/the-dauphins-treasure/ Prado] The Dauphin’s Treasure&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the vast [[malachite]] vases that rather typify Russian carving (picture below),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Vases_in_Hermitage here for several more]&lt;/ref&gt; the last notable modern producer was [[Fabergé]] in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Before he produced the famous [[Imperial Easter Egg]]s he made his reputation with small hardstone figures of animals and people, typically only 25–75mm long or wide, and small vases with a few flowers—the vase and "water" in rock crystal and the flowers in various hardstones and enamel.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 363 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jGsVHV098K0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA363&amp;dq=Hardstone+carving+Faberge&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=G_K3SqWWNIbgNdX2nboP#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books].

===Pre-Columbian and other traditions===
[[File:Olmec mask 802.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Olmec]] face mask in jade]]

Beyond the Old World, hardstone carving was important in various [[Pre-Columbian art|Pre-Columbian cultures]], including [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade in Mesoamerica]] and [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian in Mesoamerica]]. Because its colour had associations with water and vegetation, jade was also a symbol of life to many cultures; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] placed jade beads in the mouths of the dead. Lacking [[iron]], jade was the hardest material the Pre-Columbians were able to work with, apart from [[emery (rock)|emery]].

A particular type of object running through the long history of [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures from the [[Olmec]] to the Maya and [[Aztec]] is the face "mask" in semi-precious stone (they do not seem to have been for actually wearing), either carved from a single piece or of pieces inlaid on a backing of another material. Curators refer to "Olmec-style" face masks as despite being Olmec in style, to date no example has been recovered in a controlled archaeological Olmec context. However they have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of [[Tenochtitlan]] ([[Mexico City]]), which would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the [[Aztec]]s buried it, suggesting these were valued and collected as Roman antiquities were in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.uea.ac.uk/cms/index.php?q=node/873 Artworld University of East Anglia collections]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see also [http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/feature/feb01str.cfm Lapidiary Journal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003161004/http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/feature/feb01str.cfm# |date=2009-10-03 }} article, &amp; MMA&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs' own masks are more typically of [[turquoise]] inlay, the Mayans' of jade inlay (see gallery).

Another supposed type of Pre-Columbian hardstone carving is the rock [[crystal skull]]; however experts are now satisfied that all known large (life-size) examples are 19th-century forgeries, though some miniature ones may be genuinely Pre-Columbian.

The [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]], developed the carving of ''[[pounamu]]'' (jade) for weapons, tools and ornaments to a high standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://teara.govt.nz/en/pounamu-jade-or-greenstone/page-1 "Pounamu – jade or greenstone"] in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Ermitáž.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|Enormous [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] vase in [[malachite]] in the [[Hermitage Palace]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Most hardstones, including jade and quartz varieties, have a [[crystalline]] structure that does not allow detailed carving by edged tools without great wastage and a poor finish. Working them has always been very time-consuming, which together with the cost of rare materials often traded from very far away, has accounted for the great expense of these objects. After sawing and perhaps chiselling to reach the approximate shape, stones were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a [[lathe]], and by grinding-wheels. [[Emery (rock)|Emery]] has been mined for abrasive powder on [[Naxos]] since antiquity, and was known in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by cutters in antiquity. The Chinese sometimes tipped their straight drills with less-valued [[diamond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear how they learned this technique. Mughal carvers also used drills.&lt;ref&gt;Markell&lt;/ref&gt; Inlay sections could be sawed by [[bow saw]]s. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 8-16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bWo5T2JdVUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Engraved+gem&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Engraved%20gem&amp;f=false quotes passages] from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity - since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, "Gemstone enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitations==
As a highly prestigious artform using expensive materials, many different techniques for imitating hardstone carvings have been developed, some of which have themselves created significant artistic traditions. [[Celadon ware]], with a jade coloured glaze, was important in China and Korea, and in early periods used for shapes typical of jade objects. Roman [[cameo glass]] was invented to imitate cameo gems, with the advantage that consistent layers were possible even in objects in the round. The small group of 11th(?)-century [[Hedwig glass]]es are inspired by Fatimid rock-crystal vessels. In the [[Italian Renaissance]] [[agate glass]] was perfected to imitate agate vessels with multicoloured figuration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K4yIWBD05qEC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=agate%20glass&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=agate%20glass&amp;f=false agate glass]. An inventory of the treasures of [[John, Duke of Berry]] already records such a vase in 1416, but no example from this early seems to have survived.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceramic art|Ceramics]] have often been decorated to imitate gemstones, and wood, plaster and other materials painted to imitate stones. [[Scagliola]] developed in Italy to imitate pietra dura inlays on plaster; less elaborate forms are called [[marbleizing]]. Medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s often imitated both inlaid stone and engraved gems, and after printing took over [[paper marbling]] continued as a manual craft for decorating [[end-papers]] and covers.

'''''Heta-uma''''' ({{lang|ja|ヘタウマ}} or {{lang|ja|ヘタうま}}) is a Japanese underground [[manga]] movement started in the 1970 decade with the magazine ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artreview.com/opinion/ara_spring_2015_opinion_paul_gravett/|title=The ‘bad but good’ trailblazing of Yumura Teruhiko, by Paul Gravett / ArtReview|last=name|first=Site|website=artreview.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heta-uma'' can be translated as "bad but good", designating a work which looks poorly drawn, but with an aesthetically conscious quality, opposed to the polished look of mainstream manga.

The '''Academy of Music and Drama''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Högskolan för scen och musik'', abbreviated HSM) at the [[University of Gothenburg]] is a school for music, composition, opera singing, music staging, teaching of music and creative subjects in [[Gothenburg]]. It belongs to the Faculty of Fine, Applied and Performing Arts. 

It was started in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsm.gu.se/english/about-us/academy-history/?languageId=100001&amp;disableRedirect=true&amp;returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hsm.gu.se%2Fom-institutionen%2Fhistorik%2F&lt;/ref&gt; as a merger of the former departments of music, theater and opera at the university. 

The main campus building is Artisten in Gothenburg.

The school also acts as a training center for orchestral music. The programme is called the Swedish National Orchestra Academy (SNOA) and was started by the then head Ingemar Henningsson after preparatory work with the [[Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra]] (Göteborgs Symfoniker). The two-year program organizes about 8 or 9 orchestral projects per academic year.

An '''impresario''' (from the Italian ''impresa'', "an enterprise or undertaking")&lt;ref name="ImpresarioImpressa"/&gt; is a person who organizes and often finances [[concert]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], or [[opera]]s, performing a role similar to that of an [[artist manager]] or a [[film producer|film]] or [[television production|television producer]]. The term “impresario” was used by the Spanish, and then English-speaking settlers of the Pacific Northwest to describe, “one who brought a new community into being and managed affairs to ensure its prosperity.”

The term originated in the social and economic world of [[Italian opera]], in which from the  mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.&lt;ref name="Rosselli"/&gt; The owners of the theatre, usually amateurs from the nobility, charged the impresario with hiring a [[composer]] (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk. In 1786 [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce [[Der Schauspieldirektor|''Der Schauspieldirektor'' (''The Impresario'')]]. [[Antonio Vivaldi]] was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' was followed by numerous others.

Alessandro Lanari (1787–1852), who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes, eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the [[Teatro La Pergola]], in Florence, which presented the premieres of the first version of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', two of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s operas and five of [[Donizetti]]'s, including ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''. [[Domenico Barbaia]] (1778–1841) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at [[La Scala]], in Milan, where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced [[roulette]].

[[Duchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Lives in Music : Women Performers, Composers, and Impresarios from the Baroque to the Present. |last=Porter |first=Cecelia Hopkins |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780252037016 |location=Urbana |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a harpsichordist who also presided over seventeenth-century North German court music as an impresario.

==Modern use==

The traditional term is still used in the [[entertainment industry]] to refer to a producer of [[concert]]s, tours and other events in [[music]], [[opera]], [[theatre]]&lt;ref name="CraigThomas"/&gt; and even [[rodeo]].&lt;ref name="TimeRodeo1937"/&gt; Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include [[Thomas Beecham]], [[Rudolf Bing]], [[Sergei Diaghilev]], [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], [[Fortune Gallo]], [[Sol Hurok]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Aaron Richmond]], and jazz festival producer [[George Wein]].  [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who produced music shows at [[The Fillmore]] Auditorium in San Francisco, was known as a rock music impresario.

While the term is not often used for women, a modern example of a female impresario would be [[Vivienne Westwood|Vivianne Westwood]], who was largely responsible for bringing modern [[Punk fashion|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] fashions into the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vivw/hd_vivw.htm|title=Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style Source: Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style|last=Bell-Price|first=Shannon|date=2010|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of term==

The term is occasionally applied to others, such as independent art museum [[curator]]s&lt;ref name="TimeWhitney"/&gt;  and conference organizers&lt;ref name="WurmanMedalistAIGA"/&gt; who have a leading role in orchestrating events.

==Figurative impresarios==
[[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists&lt;ref name="BartlebyCouteau"/&gt;  as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration.  [[Nicholas Wade]] described [[James D. Watson]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] in ''The New York Times'' as impresarios of [[Charles Darwin]]'s works.&lt;ref name="WadeNYT"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''isometry''' (or '''[[congruence (geometry)|congruence]]''', or '''congruent transformation''') is a [[distance]]-preserving transformation between [[metric spaces]], usually assumed to be [[Bijection|bijective]].&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=29}} &lt;p&gt;"We shall find it convenient to use the word ''transformation'' in the special sense of a one-to-one correspondence &lt;math&gt; P \to P'&lt;/math&gt; among all points in the plane (or in space), that is, a rule for associating pairs of points, with the understanding that each pair has a first member {{mvar|P}} and a second member {{mvar|P'}} and that every point occurs as the first member of just one pair and also as the second member of just one pair...&lt;p&gt;In particular, an ''isometry'' (or "congruent transformation," or "congruence") is a transformation which preserves length..."&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Academ Reflections with parallel axis on wallpaper.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[Function composition|composition]] of two [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|opposite]] isometries is a direct isometry.  [[Reflection (mathematics)|A reflection]] in a line is an opposite isometry, like  {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}  or {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt;}}  on the image. [[Translation (geometry)|Translation]] {{math|''T''}} is a direct isometry: [[Rigid body|a rigid motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|p=46}} &lt;p&gt;'''3.51''' ''Any direct isometry is either a translation or a rotation. Any opposite isometry is either a reflection or a glide reflection.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Introduction==
Given a metric space (loosely, a set and a scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set), an isometry is a [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] which maps elements to the same or another metric space such that the distance between the image elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], two geometric figures are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if they are related by an isometry;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=39}}&lt;p&gt;'''3.11''' ''Any two congruent triangles are related by a unique isometry.''&lt;/ref&gt; the isometry that relates them is either a rigid motion (translation or rotation), or a [[Function composition|composition]] of a rigid motion and a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].&lt;!--commentary: i presume "they" here means the geometric figures. still commenting out because it doesn't seem to help.--&gt; &lt;!--They are equal, up to an action of a rigid motion, if related by a [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometry]] (orientation preserving).--&gt;

Isometries are often used in constructions where one space is [[Embedding|embedded]] in another space. For instance, the [[Complete space#Completion|completion]] of a metric space ''M'' involves an isometry from ''M'' into ''M''', a [[quotient set]] of the space of [[Cauchy sequence]]s on ''M''. The original space ''M'' is thus isometrically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a subspace of a [[complete metric space]], and it is usually identified with this subspace. Other embedding constructions show that every metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a [[closed set|closed subset]] of some [[normed vector space]] and that every complete metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some [[Banach space]].

An isometric surjective linear operator on a [[Hilbert space]] is called a [[unitary operator]].

==Formal definitions==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[metric space]]s with metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. A [[function (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is called an '''isometry''' or '''distance preserving''' if for any ''a'',''b'' ∈ ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;d_Y\left(f(a),f(b)\right)=d_X(a,b).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An isometry is automatically [[Injective function|injective]];&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef/&gt; otherwise two distinct points, ''a'' and ''b'', could be mapped to the same point, thereby contradicting the coincidence axiom of the metric ''d''. This proof is similar to the proof that an [[order embedding]] between [[partially ordered set]]s is injective. Clearly, every isometry between metric spaces is a topological embedding.

A '''global isometry''', '''isometric isomorphism''' or '''congruence mapping''' is a [[bijective]] isometry. Like any other bijection, a global isometry has a [[function inverse]].  The inverse of a global isometry is also a global isometry.

Two metric spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are called '''isometric''' if there is a bijective isometry from ''X'' to ''Y''. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of bijective isometries from a metric space to itself forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with respect to [[function composition]], called the '''[[isometry group]]'''.

There is also the weaker notion of ''path isometry'' or ''arcwise isometry'':

A '''path isometry''' or '''arcwise isometry''' is a map which preserves the [[Arc length#Definition|lengths of curves]]; such a map is not necessarily an isometry in the distance preserving sense, and it need not necessarily be bijective, or even injective. This term is often abridged to simply ''isometry'', so one should take care to determine from context which type is intended.

==Examples==
* Any [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] is a global isometry on Euclidean spaces. See also [[Euclidean group#Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions|Euclidean group]].
*The map &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a path isometry but not an isometry.  Note that unlike an isometry, it is not injective.
*The isometric [[linear map]]s from '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to itself are given by the [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roweis | first1 = S.

==Linear isometry==

Given two [[normed vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'', a '''linear isometry''' is a [[linear map]] ''f'' : ''V'' → ''W'' that preserves the norms:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(v)\| = \|v\|&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''v'' in ''V''.&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Jesper Funch |date=2017 |title=Lineær algebra |trans-title=Linear algebra |page=125 |language=Danish |location=Århus |publisher=Department of Mathematics, Aarhus University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear isometries are distance-preserving maps in the above sense. They are global isometries if and only if they are [[surjective]].

By the [[Mazur-Ulam theorem]], any isometry of normed vector spaces over '''R''' is [[Affine transformation|affine]].

In an inner product space, the fact that any linear isometry is an orthogonal transformation can be shown by using [[Polarization identity|polarization identities]] to
prove ''&lt;Ax, Ay&gt; = &lt;x, y&gt;''&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"/&gt; and then applying the [[Riesz representation theorem]].

==Generalizations==
* Given a positive real number ε, an '''ε-isometry''' or '''almost isometry''' (also called a '''[[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] approximation''') is a map &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; between metric spaces such that
*# for ''x'',''x''&amp;prime; ∈ ''X'' one has |''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(ƒ(''x''),ƒ(''x''&amp;prime;))&amp;minus;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''x''&amp;prime;)| &lt; ε, and
*# for any point ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' there exists a point ''x'' ∈ ''X'' with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'',ƒ(''x'')) &lt; ε

:That is, an ε-isometry preserves distances to within ε and leaves no element of the codomain further than ε away from the image of an element of the domain.  Note that ε-isometries are not assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]].

*The '''[[restricted isometry property]]''' characterizes nearly isometric matrices for sparse vectors.
*'''[[Quasi-isometry]]''' is yet another useful generalization.
* One may also define an element in an abstract unital C*-algebra to be an isometry: 
*:&lt;math&gt; a\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry if and only if &lt;math&gt; a^* \cdot a = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
:Note that as mentioned in the introduction this is not necessarily a unitary element because one does not in general have that left inverse is a right inverse.

*On a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]], the term ''isometry'' means a linear bijection preserving magnitude. See also [[Quadratic form#Quadratic spaces|Quadratic spaces]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5373">'''Joachim Ritter''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁɪtɐ|lang}}; April 3, 1903 – August 3, 1974) was a German philosopher and founder of the so-called Ritter School ({{lang-de|Ritter-Schule}}).

==Biography==
Born in [[Geesthacht]], Ritter studied philosophy, theology, German literature, and history in [[Heidelberg]], [[Marburg]], [[Freiburg]] and [[Hamburg]]. A disciple of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation on [[Nicolas of Cusa]] in 1925. Ritter was Cassirer's assistant and a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]. A [[Marxism|Marxist]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he became a member of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937 and an officer of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940. After [[World War II]], Ritter was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[University of Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schweda, ''Joachim Ritter und die Ritter-Schule zur Einführung'', Hamburg: Junius 2015, p. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter's philosophical work focuses on a theory of [[modernity]]. In a liberal interpretation of [[Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Philosophy of Right]]'', he developed the view that "bifurcation" is the constitutive structure of the modern world and a necessary precondition for the universal realization of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Comay, ''Mourning Sickness: Hegel and the French Revolution'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 2011, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritter's theory of culture as compensation, arts and humanities have the function of balancing the [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]], ahistorical condition of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas E. Di Liberto, [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=edissertations ''Overcoming the Empty Years: the Role of Philosophy and the Humanities in West Germany after 1945''] (2009). Publicly accessible Penn Dissertations. Paper 89, p. 307-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], his work on [[Aristotle]]'s ethics and political theory initiated the renewal of practical philosophy in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Cambridge: Polity 2007, p. 64-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Münster]].

==Legacy==
Ritter is considered one of the most influential philosophers in postwar [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Werner Müller, ''A Dangerous Mind: Carl Schmitt in Post-War European Thought'', Yale University Press 2003, p. 116-132&lt;/ref&gt; Among his disciples were scholars and public intellectuals like [[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]], [[Max Imdahl]], [[Hermann Lübbe]], [[Odo Marquard]], and [[Robert Spaemann]]. Together with them, Ritter started the „Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie“ and contributed to development of [[conceptual history]] in the field of philosophy. In the 1980s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] opposed the Ritter School for being leading representatives of German [[neo-conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Neoconservative Culture Criticism in the United States and West Germany: An Intellectual Movement in Two Political Cultures'', in: Télos 1983 (56), p. 75-89. &lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship in intellectual history points out Ritter's seminal role for the modernization of German political thought and the development of a modern [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jens Hacke, ''Philosophie der Bürgerlichkeit. Die liberalkonservative Begründung der Bundesrepublik'', Göttingen: Wallstein 2006/2008. See also Jerry Z. Muller, ''German Neo-Conservatism ca. 1968–1985.

'''John Scotus Eriugena''' or '''Johannes Scotus Erigena''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|oʊ|ˈ|h|æ|n|iː|z|_|ˈ|s|k|oʊ|t|ə|s|_|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|dʒ|ə|n|ə}}; c. 815 – c. 877) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] theologian, [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher, and poet. He wrote a number of works, but is best known today for having written ''The Division of Nature'', which has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which "synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries." 

Eriugena argued on behalf of something like a [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] definition of nature.&lt;ref name=Weinstein/&gt; He translated and made commentaries upon the work of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], and was one of the few Western European philosophers of his day that knew Greek, having studied in Athens. Famously, he is said to have been stabbed to death by his students at [[Malmesbury]] with their pens.

==Name==
The form "Eriugena" of his [[Epithet|byname]] is used by John Scotus to describe himself in one manuscript.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  It means 'Ireland (Ériu)-born'. 'Scottus' in the [[Middle Ages]] was the Latin term for "[[Gaels|Irish]] or [[Gaels|Gaelic]]", so his name translates as "John, the Irish-born Gael." 'Scotti" was the name that the Romans called the Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|scot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling 'Scottus' has the authority of the early manuscripts until perhaps the 11th century. Occasionally he is also named 'Scottigena' ("Irish-born") in the manuscripts.

He is not to be confused with the later philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].

==Life==
Johannes Scotus Eriugena was an Irishman, educated in Ireland.  He moved to France (about 845) and took over the Palace School at the invitation of [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] King [[Charles the Bald]]. He succeeded [[Alcuin of York]] (735–804) as head of the [[Carolingian Schools|Palace School]].&lt;ref name=eriugena&gt;{{Citation | chapter = John Scotus Erigena | url = https://archive.org/details/ageofbelief007499mbp |title=The Age of Belief | editor-first = Anne | editor-last = Freemantle | series  = [[The Mentor Philosophers]] | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | date = 1954–1955 | pages = [https://archive.org/stream/ageofbelief007499mbp#page/n77/mode/2up 72–87]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of this school, part of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], seems to have increased greatly under Eriugena's leadership, and the philosopher himself was treated with indulgence by the king. Whereas Alcuin was a schoolmaster rather than a philosopher, Eriugena was a noted [[Greek language|Greek]] scholar, a skill which, though rare at that time in Western Europe, was used in the learning tradition of Early and Medieval Ireland, as evidenced by the use of Greek script in medieval Irish manuscripts.&lt;ref name=eriugena/&gt; He remained in France for at least thirty years, and it was almost certainly during this period that he wrote his various works.

The latter part of his life is unclear. There is a story that in 882 he was invited to [[Oxford]] by [[Alfred the Great]], laboured there for many years, became abbot at [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], and was stabbed to death by his pupils with their ''[[stylus|styli]]''. Whether this is to be taken literally or figuratively is not clear,&lt;ref name=carab&gt;{{Citation | volume = John Scottus Eriugena | title = Great Medieval Thinkers | first = Deirdre | last = Caribine | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars think it may refer to some other Johannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Jean Scot Érigène, sa vie, son oeuvre, sa pensée | first = M | last = Cappuyns | place = Louvain, [[Belgium|BE]]; Mont César | year = 1933 | pages = 252–53}}. Figuratively, present day professors might recognize the irony in dying from the results of their students' pens.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably never left France, and the date of his death is generally given as 877.&lt;ref&gt;The nineteenth-century French historian, [[Hauréau]] advanced some reasons for fixing this date.&lt;/ref&gt; From the evidence available, it is impossible to determine whether he was a [[cleric]] or a [[layman]]; the general conditions of the time make it likely that he was a cleric and perhaps a [[monk]].

==Works==
His work is largely based upon [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], [[Maximus the Confessor]], and the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], and is clearly Neoplatonist. He revived the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentalist]] standpoint of Neoplatonism with its "graded hierarchy" approach. By going back to [[Plato]], he revived the [[nominalist]]–[[Medieval realism|realist]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dermot Moran]], ''The Philosophy of John Scottus Eriugena: A Study of Idealism in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the works known to have been written by Eriugena during this period was a treatise on the [[Eucharist]], which has not survived.  In it he seems to have advanced the doctrine that the Eucharist was merely symbolical or commemorative, an opinion for which [[Berengarius of Tours|Berengar of Tours]] was at a later date censured and condemned. As a part of his penance, Berengarius is said to have been compelled to burn publicly Eriugena's treatise. So far as we can learn, however, Eriugena was considered orthodox and a few years later was selected by [[Hincmar]], [[archbishop of Reims]], to defend the [[free will|doctrine of liberty of will]] against the extreme [[predestination|predestinarianism]] of the monk [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]] (Gotteschalchus). Many in the Church opposed Gottschalk's position because it denied the inherent value of good works. The treatise ''De divina praedestinatione'' composed for this occasion has been preserved, and it was probably from its content that Eriugena's orthodoxy became suspect.&lt;ref name = eriugena /&gt;

Eriugena argues the question of predestination entirely on speculative grounds, and starts with the bold affirmation that philosophy and religion are fundamentally one and the same. Even more significant is his handling of authority and reason. Eriugena offered a skilled proof that there can be predestination only to the good, for all folk are summoned to be saints.&lt;ref name = eriugena /&gt; The work was warmly assailed by Drepanius Florus, canon of Lyons, and Prudentius, and was condemned by two councils: that of [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] in 855, and that of [[Langres]] in 859. By the former council his arguments were described as ''Pultes Scotorum'' ("Irish porridge") and ''commentum diaboli'' ("an invention of the devil").

Eriugena believed that all people and all beings, including animals, reflect attributes of God, towards whom all are capable of progressing and to which all things ultimately must return.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Eriugena was a believer in ''[[apocatastasis]]'' or [[universal reconciliation]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} which maintains that the universe will eventually be restored under God's dominion (see also [[Christian Universalism]]).&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nndb.com/people/756/000095471/ | chapter = Johannes Scotus Erigena | title = Notable Names Database | accessdate = 5 August 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation of Pseudo-Dionysius===
At some point in the centuries before Eriugena a legend had developed that Saint [[Denis]], the first [[Bishop of Paris]] and patron saint of the important [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]], was the same person as both the [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] mentioned in Acts 17.34, and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a figure whose writings were not yet being circulated in the West in the ninth century (it was not until the sixteenth century, except by [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]],{{cn|date=March 2017}} that it was realised that these two figures were not connected). Accordingly, in the 820s ambassadors from the Byzantine emperor to the court of [[Louis the Pious]] donated Louis a Greek manuscript of the Dionysian corpus, which was immediately given to the Abbey of Saint Denis in the care of Abbot [[Hilduin]]. Hilduin proceeded to direct a translation of the Dionysian corpus from Greek into Latin, based on this single manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rorem, 'The Early Latin Dionysius: Eriugena and Hugh of St Victor’, "Modern Theology" 24:4, (2008), p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, probably by the middle of the ninth century, Eriugena made a second Latin translation of the Dionysian corpus, and much later wrote a commentary on "The Celestial Hierarchy". This constitutes the first major Latin reception of the Areopagite. It is unclear why Eriugena made a new translation so soon after Hilduin's. It has often been suggested that Hilduin's translation was deficient; though this is a possibility, it was a serviceable translation. Another possibility is that Eriugena's creative energies and his inclination toward Greek theological subjects motivated him to make a new translation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rorem, ‘The Early Latin Dionysius: Eriugena and Hugh of St Victor’, "Modern Theology" 24:4, (2008), p602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriugena's next work was a Latin translation of Dionysius the Areopagite undertaken at the request of Charles the Bald. This also has been preserved, and fragments of a commentary by Eriugena on Dionysius have been discovered in manuscript. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}A translation of the Areopagite's writings was not likely to alter the opinion already formed as to Eriugena's orthodoxy. [[Pope Nicholas I]] was offended that the work had not been submitted for approval before being given to the world, and ordered Charles to send Eriugena to Rome, or at least to dismiss him from his court. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} There is no evidence, however, that this order was carried out.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

At the request of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine]] emperor [[Michael III]] (ca. 858), Eriugena undertook some translation into [[Latin language|Latin]] of the works of Pseudo-Dionysius and added his own commentary. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

With this translation, he was the first since Saint Augustine to introduce the ideas of Neoplatonism from the Greek into the Western European intellectual tradition, where they were to have a strong influence on Christian theology. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===''Periphyseon''===
{{Main|De divisione naturae}}
Eriugena's great work, ''De divisione naturae'' (''On the Division of Nature'') or ''Periphyseon'', which was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), who described it as "swarming with worms of [[heresy|heretical]] perversity," and by [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585, is arranged in five books. The form of exposition is that of [[dialogue]]; the method of reasoning is the [[syllogism]]. Nature (''Natura'' in Latin or ''physis'' in Greek) is the name of the most comprehensive of all unities, that which contains within itself the most primary division of all things, that which is (being) and that which is not (nonbeing).  

The Latin title refers to these four divisions of nature: (1) that which creates and is not created; (2) that which is created and creates; (3) that which is created and does not create; (4) that which is neither created nor creates. The first is God as the ground or origin of all things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The second and third together compose the created [[universe]], which is the manifestation of God, God in process, ''Theophania''; the second is the world of [[Plato]]nic ideas or [[Theory of forms|forms]], and the third is a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] world, or a [[Pandeism|pandeistic]] one,&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;[[Max Bernhard Weinstein]], ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 283-84: "Johannes Scotus Erigena.... läßt in einer seiner mehreren Ansichten alles von Gott emaniert sein. Gottes Klarheit, welche mit Recht auch Dunkelheit genannt wird, breite sich über alles aus. Die ungeformte Materie soll nur das Unendliche bedeuten, welches, da es formlos sei, alle Formen in sich enthalte. Gott hat die Welt aus seinem eigenen Wesen gebildet. Jedes Geschöpf ist eine Theophanie, ein Sichoffenbarmachen Gottes. Gott sei an sich vorhanden wie ein Gedanke im Menschen bestehe; er manifestiere sich in der Welt durch sich selbst, wie ein Gedanke, der sich denkt, sich selbst zur Erkenntnis komme. So sei Gott ohne die Welt absolut negativ. Es klingt wie eine Blasphemie, wenn gesagt wird, Gott wisse nicht, was er sei, und er werde erst geschaffen mit der Schöpfung, indem er sich in seiner Schöpfung offenbart, die Schöpfung so aus Nichts hervorbringend. Das ist auch fast so abstrakt wie die indische Tad-Anschauung. Freilich bleibt es bei diesem absoluten, und ja auch nicht zu durchdringenden, Pandeismus nicht. Wie der Indier muß Scotus Gott doch etwas zuschreiben, Willen, und die Geschöpfe sind dann Willensakte. Der Wille ist persönlich als Emanation Gottes (als Christus) gedacht, wie wohl auch die Ursachen (zusammengefaßt als Heiliger Geist), die Scotus von Gott ausgehen läßt, Emanationen sind, und die Wirkungen, die wieder von ihnen ausgehen, Emanationen ihrer selbst darstellen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=50FDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiByZ3owbveAhULxVkKHQRbBscQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;f=false Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la maçonnerie écossaise]'', 2017: ''Par ailleurs, un certain panthéisme, ou plutôt « pandéisme », se dégage de son œuvre où l'inspiration néoplatonicienne complète parfaitement la stricte orthodoxie chrétienne.'' ("Moreover, a certain pantheism, or rather ''pandeism'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the interference of God. 

Thus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end. These three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. It is in turn through our experience that the incomprehensible divine is able to frame an understanding of itself.

''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which "synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries." It is presented, like Alcuin's book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. "Authority is the source of knowledge, but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ageofbelief007499mbp The Age of Belief], ''cit.'', [https://archive.org/stream/ageofbelief007499mbp#page/n85/mode/2up p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Eriugena's work is distinguished by the freedom of his speculation, and the boldness with which he works out his [[logic]]al or [[dialectic]]al system of the universe.  He marks, indeed, a stage of transition from the older [[Plato]]nizing philosophy to the later scholasticism.  For him philosophy is not in the service of theology.  The above-quoted assertion as to the substantial identity between philosophy and religion is repeated almost word for word by many of the later scholastic writers, but its significance depends upon the selection of one or other term of the identity as fundamental or primary. For Eriugena, philosophy or reason is first, primitive; authority or religion is secondary, derived.

His influence was greater with [[mysticism|mystics]] than with logicians, but he was responsible for a revival of philosophical thought which had remained largely dormant in western Europe after the death of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].

After Eriugena another medieval thinker of significance was [[Berengar of Tours]], professor at the monastic school in the French city.  Berengar believed that truth is obtained through reason rather than revelation.  [[St. Peter Damian]] agreed with [[Tertullian]] that it is not necessary for people to philosophize because God has spoken for them. Damian was prior of [[Fonte Avellana]] and afterward [[Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia]]. He died in 1072. [[Lanfranc]] (1005–89) was prior of [[Bec (placename element)|Bec]] in Normandy. Like Damian he believed mostly in faith, but admitted the importance of reason. [[St. Anselm]] was a pupil and successor of St. Peter Damian.&lt;ref name=eriugena/&gt;

{{Quotation|On the whole, one might be surprised that even in the seventeenth century pantheism did not gain a complete victory over theism; for the most original, finest, and most thorough European expositions of it (none of them, of course, will bear comparison with the ''[[Upanishads]]'' of the ''[[Vedas]]'') all came to light at that period, namely through [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], and Scotus Erigena.  After Scotus Erigena had been lost and forgotten for many centuries, he was again discovered at Oxford and in 1681, thus four years after Spinoza's death, his work first saw the light in print.  This seems to prove that the insight of individuals cannot make itself felt so long as the spirit of the age is not ripe to receive it.  On the other hand, in our day (1851) pantheism, although presented only in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]'s eclectic and confused revival thereof, has become the dominant mode of thought of scholars and even of educated people. This is because [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had preceded it with his overthrow of theistic [[dogmatism]] and had cleared the way for it, whereby the spirit of the age was ready for it, just as a ploughed field is ready for the seed.|[[Schopenhauer]], ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real".}}

[[Leszek Kołakowski]], a Polish Marx scholar, has mentioned Eriugena as one of the primary influences on Hegel's, and therefore Marx's, dialectical form.  In particular, he called ''De Divisione Naturae'' a prototype of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L | last = Kołakowski | title = Main Currents of Marxism | year = 1976 | volume = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Joke==
[[William of Malmesbury]]'s humorous anecdote illustrates both the character of Eriugena and the position he occupied at the French court. The king having asked, ''Quid distat inter sottum et Scottum?'' (What separates a sot [drunkard] from an Irishman?), Eriugena replied, ''Tabula tantum'' (''Only a Table'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=William of Malmesbury|authorlink=William of Malmesbury|title=Gesta pontificum Anglorum|chapter=Book 5}}Quoted in [[Helen Waddell]], ''[[The Wandering Scholars]]'' (Garden City: Doubleday, 1955), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

William of Malmesbury is not considered a reliable source on John Scotus Eriugena by modern scholars. For example, his reports that Eriugena is buried at Malmesbury  is doubted by scholars  who say that William confused John Eriugena with a different monk named John. William’s report on the manner of Eriugena’s death, killed by the pens of his students, also appears to be a legend. “It seems certain that this is due to confusion with another John and that the manner of John’s death is borrowed from the Acts of St. [[Cassian of Imola]]. Feast: (at Malmesbury), 28 January.”&lt;ref&gt;‘John the Sage, mentioned in R.P.S. (11th century) as resting at Malmesbury with Maedub and Aldhelm. He should probably be identified with the John whose tomb William of Malmesbury described and whose epitaph he transcribed. He believed that this was John Scotus Eriugena, the Irish philosopher of the 9th century, and that he was killed by the pens of his students after settling at Malmesbury. It seems certain that this is due to confusion with another John and that the manner of John’s death is borrowed from the Acts of St. Cassian of Imola. Feast: (at Malmesbury), 28 January .’ “John the Sage” The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. David Hugh Farmer. Oxford University Press 2003. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. University of Oxford. 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pyhiinvaeltaja.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/st-john-of-malmesbury/ St John of Malmesbury?]. wordpress.com (2010-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”Today (28 January) we commemorate St John ‘the Wise’ of Malmesbury (8th century). Or do we? There do seem to be several confusions and misattributions in this story, which was a good research exercise rather than particularly enlightening. Two sources were useful, Farmer and the Victoria County History: ‘At this time, about 870, according to the tradition recorded by William of Malmesbury, (fn. 59) John Scotus Erigena, the philosopher, at the instigation of King Alfred took up his residence at the abbey as a fugitive from the Continent; after some years he was murdered by his pupils. He was buried first in St. Laurence’s Church, but the body preternatural portents. The terms of the epitaph as given by William imply that the dead scholar was regarded as a martyr; and it seems clear that he bases the story on an old tradition and a tomb bearing an epitaph of a ‘John the Wise’ who is termed saint and martyr. (fn. 60) This John, however, almost certainly cannot have been the famous philosopher; he may possibly have been John the Old Saxon whose unfortunate régime at Athelney (Som.) nearly ended in murder. (fn. 61) John the Old Saxon escaped from Athelney, but when and how he died we do not know; it is possible that he is to be identified with the John the Wise of Malmesbury.’” From: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36532 ‘House of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Malmesbury’], A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 3 (1956), pp. 210-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[William wrote] ‘that John quitted Francia because of the charge of erroneous doctrine brought against him. He came to King Alfred, by whom he was welcomed and established as a teacher at Malmesbury, but after some years he was assailed by the boys, was later translated to the left of the high altar of the abbey church, chiefly as the result of whom he taught, with their styles, and so died. It never occurred to any one to identify the Old Saxon abbat of Athelney with the Irish teacher of Malmesbury—with the name John as the single point in common—until the late forger, who passed off his work as that of Ingulf, who was abbat of Croyland towards the end of the eleventh century (‘Descr. Comp.’ in Rer. Angl. Script. post Bedam, p. 870, Frankfurt, 1601); and the confusion has survived the exposure of the fraud. It is permissible to hold that William has handed down a genuine tradition of his monastery, though it would be extreme to accept all the details of what happened more than two centuries before his birth as strictly historical (see an examination of the whole question in Poole, app. ii.).’ ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1885-1900, Volume 51 Scotus by Reginald Lane-Poole.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamyana Mohyla''' ({{lang-uk|Кам'яна Могила}};  literally: "stone tomb") is an archaeological site in the [[Molochna River]] (literally "Milk river") valley, about a mile from the village of Terpinnya, [[Zaporizhia Oblast]], Ukraine. Petroglyphs of Kamyana Mohyla are dated from Upper Paleolithic (Kukrek culture) to Medieval, with Stone Age depictions subjected to most archaeological interest. 
[[File:Каменная Могила, панорама 3. Автор Максим Стоялов.jpg|thumb|]]
The site encompasses a group of isolated blocks of [[sandstone]], up to twelve meters in height, scattered around an area of some 3,000 square meters. As [[Noghai]] legend has it, it resulted from a scuffle of two [[baghatur]]s who took turns throwing rocks at each other. In truth, the site had its origins in a [[sandbank]] of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. For a long time it was an island in the Molochna River, which has since been silted up and now flows a short distance to the west. It is thought to represent the only sandstone outcrop in the [[Azov-Kuban Depression]].

The shape of this sand hill is similar to that of [[kurgan]]s that dot the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]]. In 1889, the Russian archaeologist [[Nikolay Veselovsky]] was called upon to explore the enigmatic site and started excavations the following year. As soon as he concluded that the site was a burial mound, excavations were terminated. There was very little scientific exploration of the site during the first third of the 20th century. 

In the 1930s the site was investigated by a team of scholars from [[Melitopol]] under [[Valentin Danylenko]] (1913–82). The young archaeologist claimed to have discovered thirty caves with [[petroglyph]] inscriptions which he dated from the 20th century BC to the 17th century AD. Danylenko resumed his work on the site after [[World War II]] and claimed to have discovered thirteen additional caves with petroglyphs. [[Image:Kamenna2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A stone with petroglyphs.]]
The site was designated an archaeological preserve in 1954. The move was intended to prevent the area from being flooded after construction of a [[water reservoir]]. During the following decades, the condition of petroglyphs visibly deteriorated.

Petroglyphs are found only inside the caves and grottoes of Kamenna Mohyla, many of them still filled up with sand. No adequate protection from the elements has been provided to this day. No traces of ancient human settlement have been discovered in the vicinity, leading many scholars to believe that the hill served as a remote [[sanctuary]]. Faint traces of red paint remain on parts of the surface. Scholars have been unable to agree whether the petroglyphs date from [[Mesolithic]] or [[Neolithic]]. The latter dating is more popular, although the presumed depiction of a [[mammoth]] in one of the caves seems to favour the former date.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In 2006, the government of Ukraine nominated the site for inscription on the [[World Heritage List]]. On the whole, the Stone Tomb images represent traces of religious exercises of the hunters and cattle-breeders of this steppe zone of southeast Europe from the 20th century BC to the 17th century AD. Some caves are of artificial origin; their cultural strata have been fixed as the Neolithic, Bronze and Early Iron Ages as well as of Middle Ages.[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5075/]

Danylenko's magnum opus about the site was released posthumously, but it took the publication of [[Anatoly Kifishin]]'s hefty monograph in 2001 to attract wider attention to Kamenna Mohyla. In this controversial work, Kifishin compared the petroglyphs of Kamenna Mohyla to those of [[Çatalhöyük]] and concluded that both were related to the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform script]]. Shortly before his death, [[Igor Diakonov]] lashed out against Kifishin's hypothesis (the two openly feuded since the 1960s).

'''''La Mariée''''' ([[French language|French]] for "'''The Bride'''") is a [[painting]] on canvas, 68×53&amp;nbsp;cm, created in 1950 by Russian-French [[artist]] [[Marc Chagall]]. It is held in a private collection in [[Japan]].

==The painting==
Chagall paintings often feature young women or couples, but in ''La Mariée'' the focus is on a singular young woman in quasi-wedding attire with a bouquet of flowers. Described by a Chagall fans as "an ode to young love", the woman is presented to the viewer in a bold and conspicuous fashion, as if the viewer is the one marrying her.&lt;ref name=ChagPaint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chagallpaintings.org/mariee.html|title=''La Mariée'', Marc Chagall|publisher=ChagallPaintings.org|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colours===
The second peculiarity of ''La Mariée'' compared to the majority of other Chagall paintings is the choice of colors. The young woman is dressed in a red dress lively, with a virginal white veil draped over her head, while the background is mostly a mix of fresh and soft blue and gray. This effect allows the image of the woman to jump off the canvas and attract the viewer's attention. It is evident that Chagall has attempted to highlight the woman, as is tradition in every marriage.&lt;ref name=ChagPaint/&gt;

===Images in ''La Mariée''===
The wedding is the major theme of the painting, and includes a feature found in other Chagall paintings and in many other European artworks of the twentieth century, animals playing musical instruments. In this case it's a goat playing a violin. The painting also shows a man hanging over the head of the bride with his hands on her veil, a church which stands in the background almost as an afterthought,&lt;ref name=ChagPaint/&gt; a man playing a flute, a girl with [[Pigtail|pigtails]], a fish  with arms holding a candle and a chair, several more buildings, and a rooster.

==''Notting Hill''==
{{main|Notting Hill (film)}}
In the [[1999 in film|1999]] film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'', [[Julia Roberts]]' character Anna Scott sees a poster of ''La Mariée'' in the home of [[Hugh Grant]]'s character, William Thacker. Anna later gives William what is presumably the original.

According to director [[Roger Michell]] in an article in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the painting was chosen because screenwriter [[Richard Curtis]] was a fan of Chagall's work, and because ''La Mariée'' "depicts a yearning for something that's lost." Producers had a reproduction made for use in the film, but had to first get permission from the painting's owners and obtain clearance from the British [[Design and Artists Copyright Society]]. Finally, according to producer [[Duncan Kenworthy]], "... we had to agree to destroy it. They were concerned that if our fake was too good, it might float around the market and create problems." The article notes that the canvas used in the film could have been "worth between $500,000 and $1 million." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273720,00.html Flashes ~ ''Entertainment Weekly'', issue #489] June 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnum Photos''' is an international [[photography|photographic]] [[cooperative]] owned by its [[photographer]]-members, with offices in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Tokyo]].  According to co-founder [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], "Magnum is a community of thought, a shared human quality, a curiosity about what is going on in the world, a respect for what is going on and a desire to transcribe it visually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnumphotos.com/about|title=Magnum Photos History of Magnum|website=www.magnumphotos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of agency==
[[Robert Capa]], [[David Seymour (photographer)|David "Chim" Seymour]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[George Rodger]] and [[William Vandivert]] (all photographers), Rita Vandivert and [[Maria Eisner]] were the founding members of Magnum in Paris in 1947, based on an idea of Capa's. Seymour, Cartier-Bresson and Rodger were all absent from the meeting at which it was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Miller]], ''Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History'' (New York: Grove, 1998; {{ISBN|0-8021-3653-2}}), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; (In response to a letter telling him that he was a member, Rodger wrote that Magnum seemed a good idea but, "It all sounded too halcyon to be true," when Capa had told him of it and, "I rather dismissed the whole thing from my mind".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Magnum,'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;) Rita Vandivert was the first President, and head of the New York office; Maria Eisner the head of the Paris office.&lt;ref name="Miller, Magnum, p.51"&gt;Miller, ''Magnum,'' p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for Rodger to cover Africa and the Middle East; Cartier-Bresson to cover south and east Asia; Seymour and William Vandivert to cover Europe and the United States, respectively; and Capa to be free to follow his curiosity and events.&lt;ref name="Miller, Magnum, p.51"/&gt;

Magnum is one of the first photographic [[cooperatives]], owned and administered entirely by members. The staff serve a support role for the photographers, who retain all copyrights to their own work.

The Magnum cooperative has included [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] from across the world, who have covered many historical events of the 20th century.  The cooperative's archive includes photographs depicting [[family]] life, [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]], [[religion]], [[war]], [[poverty]], [[famine]], [[crime]], [[government]] and [[Celebrity|celebrities]]. [[Magnum In Motion]] is the multimedia offshoot of Magnum Photos and is based in New York City.

Although it has been asserted that the name "Magnum" was chosen because the founding members always drank a bottle of champagne during the first meetings,&lt;ref&gt;''Die Leica-Geschichte,'' TV-Documentary, can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWwarnnM71A here] (YouTube).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Miller]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was . . . presumably agreed by those present [at the first meeting] that Magnum was a fine new name for such a bold new venture, indicative as it was of greatness in its literal Latin translation, toughness in its gun connotation and celebration in its champagne mode.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Magnum'', p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Governance ==
Magnum is owned by its photographers, who act as shareholders. Each full member of Magnum has a vote in proposals made at a meeting held once a year, called the Annual General Meeting (AGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_6&amp;RW=1449&amp;RH=1301#/CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_6&amp;RW=1449&amp;RH=1301|title=Magnum Photos History of Magnum|website=pro.magnumphotos.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="magnumphotos_AGM"/&gt; Photographers with the status of contributor or correspondent are represented by Magnum but have no voting rights. Full members can choose to become contributors after 23 years of membership; this status gives them increased liberty to work outside Magnum, at the cost of their voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_6&amp;RW=1449&amp;RH=1301#/CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_6&amp;RW=1449&amp;RH=1301|title=Magnum Photos History of Magnum|website=pro.magnumphotos.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections of new members==
In the early years of Magnum, membership had generally come about by the personal invitation of Robert Capa. However, in 1955 a three-stage membership system was set up that continues to this day&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Magnum'', p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; and is described below. Until 1953 there were also a large number of [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]] who used Magnum but were not members.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Magnum'', pp. 70, 97, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnum's photographers meet once a year, during the last weekend in June, in New York, Paris or London, to discuss the cooperative's business. One day of the meeting is reserved to review potential new members' portfolios and vote on admitting individuals. An approved applicant is invited to become a 'Nominee Member' of Magnum, a category of membership that provides a chance for members and the individual to get to know each other, but that includes no binding commitments on either side.

After two years of Nominee membership, a photographer may present another portfolio if wanting to apply for 'Associate Membership'. If successful, the photographer is bound by the rules of the agency, and enjoys its facilities and worldwide representation. The difference between an Associate Member and a full Member is that an Associate is not a Director of the Company and does not have voting rights in the corporate decision-making. After two more years, an Associate wanting to be considered for full membership presents another portfolio of work for consideration by the members. Once elected as a full member, the individual is a member of Magnum for life or for as long as the photographer chooses.

No member photographer of Magnum has ever been asked to leave.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Photographic collection==
In February 2010, Magnum announced that [[Michael Dell]]'s venture capital firm [[MSD Capital]] had acquired a collection of nearly 200,000 original press prints of images taken by Magnum photographers. It had formed a partnership with the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] to preserve, catalog, and make photographs available to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/arts/design/02magnum.html?scp=1&amp;sq=magnum&amp;st=cse |title=News Photos, on the Move, Make News |author=Randy Kennedy |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2010/02/02/hrc_magnum_photos/ |title=Historic Photo Print Archive, Featuring Iconic 20th Century Images, Has New Owner and Home |author=Press Release |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/life-arts/ut-receives-historical-treasure-1.2139790 |title=UT Receives Historical Treasure: Harry Ransom Center acquires 20th-century photography archive |author=Gerald Rich |publisher=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 it was announced MSD Capital donated the collection to the Ransom Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/dell-led-trio-to-donate-magnum-photo-archive-to-university-of-texas/?_r=0 |title=Dell-Led Trio to Donate Magnum Photo Archive to University of Texas |author=Michael J. de la Merced |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary inventory is available for researchers who wish to use the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00502.xml |title=Magnum Photos, Inc.: A Preliminary Inventory of Its Collection in the Photography Collection at the Harry Ransom Center |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |author=[[Harry Ransom Center]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That was the positive view. The negative aspect is found in a draft for a letter to Magnum in which Gene tried to respond to a recent decision by Magnum's members to censure him: 'I stand thoroughly censured, I'm broke, desperate, tired - however, the censure is right, I am guilty. I trust that the photographers of Magnum are willing to stand on their public records. I trust that the photographers of Magnum are willing that I publicly evaluate them accordingly as they have achieved. I am not interested in their excuses accordingly to their private confessions. Their blames, including Smith, will not be of my concern.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1600 Himmelsscheibe von Nebra sky disk anagoria.jpg|thumb|Another photograph, at the [[Pergamon Museum]] ]]

The '''Nebra sky disk''' is a [[bronze]] disk of around {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} diameter and a weight of {{convert|2.2|kg|lb}}, with a blue-green [[patina]] and inlaid with gold symbols. These are interpreted generally as a sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars (including a cluster interpreted as the [[Pleiades]]). Two golden arcs along the sides, marking the angle between the [[solstice]]s, were added later. A final addition was another arc at the bottom surrounded with multiple strokes (of uncertain meaning, variously interpreted as a [[Solar Deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|Solar Barge]] with numerous oars, as the [[Milky Way]], or as a [[rainbow]]).

The disk is attributed to a site near [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], in Germany, and [[Archaeological association|associatively]] [[Chronological dating|dated]] to {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1600 BC. It has been associated with the [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] [[Unetice culture]].

The style in which the disk is executed was unlike any artistic style then known from the period, with the result the object was initially suspected of being a [[forgery]], but it is now widely accepted as authentic.

The Nebra sky disk features the oldest concrete depiction of the [[cosmos]] yet known from anywhere in the world. In June 2013 it was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] and termed "one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-6/nebra-sky-disc/ | work=Unesco memory of the World  | title=Nebra Sky Disc | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The disk, two bronze swords, two hatchets, a chisel, and fragments of spiral bracelets were discovered in 1999 by Henry Westphal and Mario Renner while they were treasure-hunting with a metal detector. Archaeological artifacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt. The hunters were operating without a license and knew their activity constituted looting and was illegal. They damaged the disk with their spade and destroyed parts of the site. The next day, Westphal and Renner sold the entire hoard for 31,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] to a dealer in [[Cologne]]. The hoard changed hands within Germany over the next two years, being sold for up to a million&amp;nbsp;DM. By 2001 knowledge of its existence had become public. In February 2002 the state archaeologist Harald Meller acquired the disk in a police-led sting operation in [[Basel]] from a couple who had put it on the black market for 700,000&amp;nbsp;DM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H.|date=January 2004|title=Star search|journal=National Geographic|pages=76–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original finders were eventually traced. In a plea bargain, they led police and archaeologists to the discovery site. Archaeologists opened a dig at the site and uncovered evidence that supports the looters' claims. There are traces of bronze artifacts in the ground, and the soil at the site matches soil samples found clinging to the artifacts. The disk and its accompanying finds are now held at the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|State Museum of Prehistory]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

The two looters received sentences of four months and ten months, respectively, from a [[Naumburg]] court in September 2003. They appealed, but the appeals court raised their sentences to six and twelve months, respectively.

The discovery site is a [[prehistoric enclosure]] encircling the top of a {{convert|252|m}} elevation in the [[Ziegelroda Forest]], known as ''Mittelberg'' ("central hill"), some 60&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Leipzig]]. The surrounding area is known to have been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era, and Ziegelroda Forest contains approximately 1,000 [[tumulus|barrows]].

The enclosure is oriented in such a way that the sun seems to set every [[solstice]] behind the [[Brocken]], the highest peak of the [[Harz]] mountains, some 80&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west. The treasure-hunters claimed the artifacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.

==Dating==
[[Image:Nebra Schwerter.jpg|thumb|The [[Bronze Age sword|swords]] found with the disk]]
[[Image:Nebra Hort.jpg|thumb|Other associated finds: chisel, axeheads, bracelets]]
The precise [[Chronological dating|dating]] of the Nebra sky disk depended upon the dating of a number of Bronze Age weapons, which were offered for sale with the disk and said to be from the same site. These axes and swords can be dated typologically to the mid 2nd millennium BC. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a birchbark particle found on one of the swords to between 1600 and 1560 BC confirmed this estimate. This corresponds to the date of burial, at which time the disk had likely been in existence for several generations.

==Origin of the metals==
According to an initial analysis of trace elements by [[x-ray fluorescence]] by E. Pernicka, then at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|University of Freiberg]], the copper originated at [[Bischofshofen]] in Austria, while the [[gold]] was thought to be from the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Pernicka, E.|author2= Wunderlich, C-H.|last-author-amp= yes|title=Naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen an den Funden von Nebra|journal=Archäologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent analysis found that the gold used in the first phase was from the [[river Carnon]] in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ehser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehser|first=Anja |first2=Gregor|last2=Borg |first3=Ernst|last3=Pernicka |title=Provenance of the gold of the Early Bronze Age Nebra Sky Disk, central Germany: geochemical characterization of natural gold from Cornwall|journal=European Journal of Mineralogy|date=2011|volume=23|issue=6|pages=895–910|doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2011/0023-2140|url=http://eurjmin.geoscienceworld.org/content/23/6/895.short|accessdate=12 November 2013|bibcode=2011EJMin..23..895E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tin present in the bronze was also of Cornish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4754.2010.00515.x | volume=52 | title=Tin isotopy: a new method for solving old questions | year=2010 | journal=Archaeometry | pages=816–832 | last1 = Haustein | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The disk as preserved was developed in four stages (Meller 2004):
# Initially the disk had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached. The circular plate is interpreted as either the [[Sun]] or the [[full Moon]], the crescent shape as the [[Lunar phase|crescent Moon]] (or either the Sun or the Moon undergoing [[eclipse]]), and the dots as [[star]]s, with the cluster of seven dots likely representing the [[Pleiades]].
# At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disk. To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible. The two arcs span an angle of 82°, correctly indicating the angle between the positions of sunset at summer and winter [[solstice]] at the latitude of the Mittelberg (51°N)&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lost Treasures; Civilization's Great Riches Rediscovered | publisher=Carlton Books | author=McIntosh, Jane | year=2010 | location=London | pages=16 | isbn=9781847322999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given that the arcs relate to solar phenomena, it is likely the circular plate represents the Sun not the Moon.
# The final addition was another arc at the bottom, the "[[solar barge|sun boat]]", again made of gold from a different origin.
# By the time the disk was buried it also had thirty-nine holes punched out around its perimeter, each approximately 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance==
The disk may be an [[archaeoastronomy|astronomical]] instrument as well as an item of [[prehistoric religion|religious]] significance. The blue-green patina of the bronze may have been an intentional part of the original artifact.&lt;ref name=meller2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H|date=2002|title=Die Himmelsscheibe von Nebra – ein frühbronzezeitlicher Fund von außergewohnlicher Bedeutung|journal=Archäeologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=7–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find is regarded as reconfirming that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the [[European Bronze Age]] included close observation of the yearly course of the [[Sun]], and the angle between its rising and setting points at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s. While much older [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] and [[megalithic]] [[astronomical complex]]es such as the [[Goseck circle]] and [[Stonehenge]] had already been used to mark the solstices, the disk is the oldest known "portable instrument" to allow such measurements. Pásztor, however, sees no evidence that the disk was a practical device for solar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Emilia | last = Pásztor | author-link = | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L. N. | chapter = Nebra Disk | title = Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy | date = 2015 | pages = 1349–1356 | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_128 | isbn = 978-1-4614-6140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euan MacKie]] suggests that the Nebra disk may be linked to the solar calendar reconstructed by [[Alexander Thom]] from his analysis of standing stone alignments in Britain.&lt;ref name="MacKie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=MacKie, E|date=2006|chapter=New evidence for a professional priesthood in the European Early Bronze Age?|title=Viewing the Sky Through Past and Present Cultures: Selected Papers from the Oxford VII International Conference on Archaeoastronomy|editor=Todd W. Bostwick|editor2=Bryan Bates|series= [[Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites|Pueblo Grande Museum]] Anthropological Papers |volume=15|publisher=City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department|pages=343–362|isbn=1-882572-38-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
There were initial suspicions that the disk might be an [[archaeological forgery]]. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disk was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disk could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disk in his own hands, unlike eighteen scientists who had actually examined the disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCD175863466D41BB9A6A93D460B81174/Doc~E4115FE522E3C4CDD89890E5C3B4A9106~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Himmelsscheibe von Nebra - Eine Komödie der Irrungen|date=March 17, 2005|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=German|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the [[University of Bristol]] and an expert on the [[Beaker people]], allowed his initial reaction to be quoted in a [[BBC]] documentary:&lt;ref name=BBC2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/stardisctrans.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Secrets of the Star Disc|date=2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery. Because it’s such an extraordinary piece that it wouldn’t surprise any of us that a clever forger had cooked this up in a backroom and sold it for a lot of money."
Although Harrison had not seen the skydisk when he was interviewed, his skepticism was reasonable at that point, but the disk is widely accepted now as authentic and is dated to roughly 1600 BC on grounds of typological classification of the associated finds.
As the item was not excavated using archaeological methods, even its claimed provenance could have been fictitious - hence its authentication has depended on microphotography of corrosion crystals,&lt;ref name=BBC2008 /&gt; which has produced images of structures that could not be reproduced by a faker.

Harald Meller, lecturing to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in April 2008, gave a list of facts supporting the authenticity of the disc, and for its having been found at the site on the Mittelberg. The most persuasive of the latter was the discovery by the archaeologists — in the pit in which the looters said they had found the metalwork — of a fragment of gold leaf exactly fitting the gap present in the gold leaf covering of the 'sun' symbol when it was originally recovered.

==Exhibition==
The disk was the center of an exhibition entitled ''Der geschmiedete Himmel'' (German "The [[smithing|smithied]] sky"), showing 1,600 Bronze Age artifacts, including the [[Trundholm sun chariot]], shown at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] from 15 October 2004 to 22 May 2005, from 1 July to 22 October 2005 in [[Copenhagen]], from 9 November 2005 to 5 February 2006 in [[Vienna]], from 10 March to 16 July 2006 in [[Mannheim]], and from 29 September 2006 to 25 February 2007 in [[Basel]].

On 20 June 2007 a multimedia visitor center was opened near the discovery site at Nebra.

The disk is part of the permanent exhibition in the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory)]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

==Legal issues==
The [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has registered the disk as a [[trademark]], which has resulted in two lawsuits. In 2003, Saxony-Anhalt successfully sued the city of [[Querfurt]] for depicting the disk design on souvenirs. Saxony-Anhalt also successfully sued the publishing houses [[Piper Verlag|Piper]] and Heyne over an abstracted depiction of the disk on book covers.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelsscheibe von Nebra {{cite web |url=http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051336/http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magdeburg]] court assessed the case's relevance according to [[German copyright law]]. The defenders argued that as a cultic object, the disk had already been "published" in the Bronze Age, and that consequently, all protection of [[intellectual property]] associated with it has long expired. The plaintiff on the other hand, argued that the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the disk is recent, and according to German law protected for 25 years, until 2027. Another argument concerned the question whether a notable work of art may be registered as a trademark in the first place.

The '''representation of women in Athenian tragedy''' was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[The arts|art-forms]] constitutes a [[paradox]]. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female [[Character (arts)|characters]]: [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]''. Female [[Greek chorus|tragic choruses]] also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.&lt;ref name="Easterling"&gt;Easterling, P. E. (Ed.). (1997). ''Cambridge companion to Greek tragedy.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural stereotype== 
Macaria, in the ''[[Heracleidae]]'' states that "for a woman, silence and self control are best."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; The philosopher [[Xenophon]] thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion.&lt;ref name="Bushnell"&gt;Bushnell, R. W. (Ed.). (2005). ''A companion to tragedy.'' Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D14&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into "the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; [[Sheila Murnaghan]] argues that "it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease."&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father.&lt;ref name="Blondell"&gt;Blondell, R., et al. (Ed.). (1999). ''Women on the edge: four plays by Euripides.'' New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; 
The playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist [[Alcestis]], represents the "perfect wife" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet as Blondell points out this "female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic" as her own marriage kills her.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

The most important relationships within this play are between the men. [[Heracles]] goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. [[Admetos]] goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. "Alcestis drops out," Easterling argues, "to facilitate the interaction between the men."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt;

In contrast, however, Euripides [[Medea]] breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. "In a sense," Blondell argues, "every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband."&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

==Theatrical themes==

===The problem of male absence===
In the surviving plays, women become [[Tragedy|tragic]] figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

[[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]] takes action after her uncle [[Creon]] refuses to bury her brother [[Polynices]]. In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] takes power in [[Argos]] because her husband [[Agamemnon]] has been away fighting at [[Troy]] for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband [[Jason]] plans a new more advantageous marriage.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The public versus the private===
There is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was [[Setting (narrative)|set]] outside the private sphere of the home.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; Indeed, [[Euripides]] was notorious for "taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy" and thereby reducing its remoteness.&lt;ref name="McLeish"&gt;McLeish, K., et al. (Trans.). (2005). ''Greek tragedy.'' London: Nick Hern.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt; In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son [[Orestes]] forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. "This three play sequence," Bushnell argues, "which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

===The female warrior===
A woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. [[Euripides]]' [[Medea]] is the prime example. Her name in Greek means "cunning" and is also the word for the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt;

Most of the time, a woman is full of fear&lt;br&gt;
Too weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel &lt;br&gt;
But if she happens to be wronged in love,&lt;br&gt;
Hers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all.&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

Ruby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as [[Patroclus]] famously does to [[Homer]]’s [[Achilles]] in the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]''.&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; Yet Medea, similarly to [[Aeschylus]]’ [[Clytemnestra]], another "woman with a heart of manly counsel"&lt;ref name="Blondell" /&gt; were not admired  but portrayed as "[[Cruella de Vil]]" type characters.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

So the declaration "that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour" does not apply to women.&lt;ref name="McLeish" /&gt;

==Public reaction==
In [[Plato]]’s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], [[Socrates]] thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried "about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy."&lt;ref name="Easterling" /&gt; Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal [[Polis|city-state]].&lt;ref name="Bushnell" /&gt;

The [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] however thought it important to place on "display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice."&lt;ref name="Bushnell"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3824">The '''Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences''', otherwise known as the '''Massey Commission''', chaired by [[Vincent Massey]], was founded in 1949. The Massey Commission examined Canada's cultural needs. Massey had long believed that Canadians' rich cultural history was deeply embedded in European culture but was too little known to the world. An avid art collector himself, he sponsored exhibits in Europe and saw the need for a national commitment to promoting the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Horrall, "'A Century of Canadian Art': the Tate Gallery exhibition of 1938," ''British Journal of Canadian Studies'' (2014) 27#2 pp 149-162. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/british_journal_of_canadian_studies/v027/27.2.horrall.html  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The report==

Other than Massey, the commissioners included social scientist [[Georges-Henri Lévesque]], historian [[Hilda Neatby]], university president [[Norman MacKenzie (politician)|Norman MacKenzie]], and engineer Arthur Surveyor, co-founder of [[SNC-Lavalin]]. They held public hearings across Canada. The final report appeared in June 1951. It advised that Canada's international identity needed building up, and must be based on more than political and economic factors. It argued that the arts provide a strong sense of national community, and that the government should establish a national board to administer public funds intended to encourage work in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  It especially wanted funding for nonprofit agencies, rather than for-profit corporations. It called for more money for universities and strengthening existing public radio system, and its expansion into television.  Without aggressive federal funding, the report suggested, there was a risk of that authentic Canadian culture would be crowded out of its own nation  by Cheaper American popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Litt, "The Massey Commission, Americanization, and Canadian Cultural Nationalism," [[Queen's Quarterly]], 1991, 98#2 pp 375-387&lt;/ref&gt;

The government accepted the recommendations on university funding and strengthening the CBC; otherwise it largely ignored the report. However, the Report did lead to the establishment of the  [[Library and Archives Canada|National Library of Canada]] in 1953 and the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Encouragement of the Arts, Letters, Humanities, and Social Sciences]] in 1957. Contrary to the recommendation not to support a private film industry, in 1967 the government created the [[Canadian Film Development Corporation]] (CFDC) to subsidize films, that could reach the American mass-market.

[[Francophone]] critics accused the report of privileging elite, Anglophone conservative culture at the expense of Quebec's historic cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Ziraldo, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the literature of the [[United States]], which in the last thirty years has acquired an increasing international reputation, exercises an impact which is beneficial in many respects no doubt, but which, at the same time, may be almost overpowering. (Report, chapter 15)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''SYZ conjecture''' is an attempt to understand the [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] conjecture, an issue in theoretical physics and mathematics. The original conjecture was proposed in a paper by [[Andrew Strominger|Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau|Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow|Zaslow]], entitled "Mirror Symmetry is ''T''-duality".&lt;ref name="SYZ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Strominger |first=Andrew |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |last3=Zaslow |first3=Eric |year=1996 |title=Mirror symmetry is ''T''-duality |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=479 |issue=1–2 |pages=243–259 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(96)00434-8 |arxiv = hep-th/9606040 |bibcode = 1996NuPhB.479..243S }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[homological mirror symmetry| homological mirror symmetry conjecture]], it is one of the most explored tools applied to understand mirror symmetry in mathematical terms. While the homological mirror symmetry is based on [[homological algebra]], the SYZ conjecture is a geometrical realization of mirror symmetry.

== Formulation ==
In [[string theory]], mirror symmetry relates [[type IIA]] and [[type IIB]] theories. It predicts that the effective field theory of type IIA and type IIB should be the same if the two theories are compactified on mirror pair manifolds.

The SYZ conjecture uses this fact to realize mirror symmetry. It starts from considering [[BPS state]]s of type IIA theories compactified on ''X'', especially [[0-brane]]s that have [[moduli space]] ''X''. It is known that all of the BPS states of type IIB theories compactified on ''Y'' are [[3-brane]]s. Therefore, mirror symmetry will map 0-branes of type IIA theories into a subset of 3-branes of type IIB theories.

By considering [[supersymmetric]] conditions, it has been shown that these 3-branes should be [[special Lagrangian submanifold]]s.&lt;ref name="BBS"&gt;{{Citation |last=Becker |first=Katrin |last2=Becker |first2=Melanie |last3=Strominger |first3=Andrew |year=1995 |title=Fivebranes, membranes and non-perturbative string theory |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=456 |issue=1–2 |pages=130–152 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(95)00487-1 |arxiv = hep-th/9507158 |bibcode = 1995NuPhB.456..130B }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{Citation |last=Harvey |first=Reese |last2=Lawson |first2=H. Blaine, Jr. |year=1982 |title=Calibrated geometries |journal=Acta Mathematica |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=47–157 |doi=10.1007/BF02392726 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[T-duality]] does the same transformation in this case, thus "mirror symmetry is T-duality".

'''''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. In the painting, [[Catherine of Alexandria]] is looking upward in ecstasy and leaning on a wheel - an allusion to the [[breaking wheel]] (or Catherine wheel) of her martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;Capgrave, John, and Karen A. Winstead. 2011. ''The life of Saint Katherine of Alexandria.'' Notre Dame, Ind: University of Notre Dame Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was painted c. 1507, towards the end of Raphael's sojourn in Florence and shows the young artist in a transitional phase. The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of [[Pietro Perugino]]. But the graceful [[contrapposto]] of Catherine's pose is typical of the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] on Raphael, and is believed to be an echo of Leonardo's lost painting ''[[Leda and the Swan]]''.

==Painting materials==
Raphael employed the usual [[Renaissance]] [[pigments]] such as natural [[ultramarine]], [[madder lake]], [[ochres]] and [[lead-tin-yellow|lead-tin yellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/raphael-saint-catherine-alexandria/ Raphael, Saint Catherine of Alexandria], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt; He also mixed a special kind of finely powdered glass into several pigments to speed up the drying of the oil paints.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A., Spring, M., Plazzotta, C. ‘Raphael’s Early Work in the National Gallery: Paintings before Rome‘. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 25, pp 4–35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''St. Jerome in His Study''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Antonello da Messina]], thought to have been completed around 1460–1475. It is in the collection of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[London]].

The picture was painted by Antonello during his Venetian sojourn, and was the property of Antonio Pasqualino.

==Description==
[[File:Antonello da Messina - Loewe des Hieronymus.jpg|thumb|left|154px|Detail of one of the windows, showing the lion of St. Jerome]]

The small picture portrays [[St. Jerome]] working in his studio, a room without walls and ceiling seen from a kind of triumphal arch (probably within some church of Aragonese style). As in several other works by the Messinese painter, the main scene is accompanied by a host of details, that have points of contact with the contemporary Flemish school: books, animals, objects, all painted with a magnificent taste for detail and "optical truth".

The scene is devised such that the light rays coincide with the perspective axes, centering on the saint's bust and hands. A Mediterranean landscape is hinted at through the windows opening on both sides of the study. Animals include a partridge (''alectoris graeca'') and a peacock, in the foreground, both having symbolical meanings, a cat and a lion, typically associated with St Jerome, in the shade on the right.

== Symbolism ==
Antonello uses many symbols throughout the painting. The book St. Jerome is reading represents knowledge. The books surrounding him refer to his translation of the Bible into Latin, the [[Vulgate]]. The lion in the shadows to the right of the saint is from a story about St. Jerome pulling a thorn out of a lion's paws. In gratitude, the lion follows St. Jerome around for the rest of his life, like a house cat. The peacock and partridge play no specific part in the story of St. Jerome. However, the peacock generally symbolizes immortality, and the partridge is an ambivalent reference to truth/deceit.

{{Nihongo|'''''Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi bridge and Atake'''''|大はしあたけの夕立|''Ōhashi atake no yūdachi''}} is a woodblock print in the [[ukiyo-e]] genre by the Japanese artist [[Hiroshige]].  It was published in 1857 as part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' and is one of the best known of Hiroshige's prints.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'&gt;{{cite book |last=Bicknell |first=Julian |date=1994 |title=Hiroshige in Tokyo: The Floating World of Edo |location=London |publisher=New England Editions Limited |page=118 |isbn=1-56640-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known variant state of this print, the variant owned by [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], is in fact a later state. The first state depicted an additional two boats, a different background, less angular rain, and a carving error in the pylons that was corrected by handpainting.

==''One Hundred Famous Views of Edo''==
The picture is part of the series ''[[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]]'' which actually features 119 views of 'named places' or 'celebrated spots' in the area that is today [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Brooklyn Museum - Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt; The series was unique in being the first to feature this many separate landscape views.&lt;ref name="brooklyn2"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/research/edo/places/ Research: Hiroshige's One Hundread Famous Views of Edo: Famous Places of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was produced between 1856 and 1859 with [[Hiroshige II]] finishing the series after the death of Hiroshige in 1858. This print was published in the [[Japanese calendar|ninth month]] of 1857.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; The series was commissioned shortly after the [[1855 Edo earthquake]] and subsequent fires and featured many of the newly rebuilt or repaired buildings. The prints may have commemorated or helped draw Edo's citizens attention to the progress of the rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulumuseum.org/art/exhibitions/11559-good_news_hiroshige_new_interpretation_series_one_hundred_famous_views_edo/ Good News from Hiroshige: A New Interpretation of the Series “One Hundred Famous Views of Edo”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Shinohashi bridge Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|The modern Shinohashi bridge in Tokyo in a very similar location to the old bridge.]]
The print shows a small part of the wooden ''Ōhashi'' (Great) bridge diagonally across the foreground of the image as the bridge crosses the [[Sumida River]]. In the background is a boatman punting his log raft towards the Fukagawa timber yards, looking for shelter.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/121666/Sudden_Shower_Over_Shin-Ohashi_Bridge_and_Atake_Ohashi_Atake_no_Yudachi_No._58_from_One_Hundred_Famous_Views_of_Edo Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake (Ohashi Atake no Yudachi), No. 58 from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt;&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt; Also seen is the far bank of the river in a part of Edo known as ''Atake'' after the government ship, the ''Atakemaru'' that was moored there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08533/artifact_aspx_id_1074.html Ohashi bridge, evening shower in Atake]&lt;/ref&gt; Two women and four or five men are shown crossing the bridge sheltering under hats, umbrellas or straw capes from a sudden shower of rain.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; Sudden showers are a recurring theme in ukiyo-e works and here in what Hiroshige calls "white rain"&lt;ref name="artwolf"&gt;[http://www.theartwolf.com/masterworks/hiroshige.htm 'Oshashi Bridge &amp; Atake in a suden shower']&lt;/ref&gt; are depicted using a large number of thin dark parallel lines in 2 directions - a difficult skill in woodblock printing.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/55433?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=hiroshige&amp;pos=24 Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge and Atake (Ōhashi Atake no yūdachi), from the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.transparent.com/japanese/hiroshige/ Japanese Language Blog - Hiroshige]&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the print are dark clouds from which the rain emanates, these are produced using a [[Bokashi (printing)|
bokashi]] technique, another difficult printing technique, and vary significantly between prints. Other bokashi areas seen in some prints are the water around the bridge and the bridge's roadway.&lt;ref name='In Tokyo'/&gt; The rain, sheltering people and log raft at the centre of the image give the image a sense of movement.&lt;ref name="artwolf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terimakasih.cc/gallery/ukiyoe.html Ukiyoe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges have been sited at that same location since 1694. The wooden bridge depicted in the print was replaced by another bridge in 1885, completed in 1912 and later moved to a new site elsewhere. The current bridge at the site was erected in 1973.

Hiroshige's most popular prints were produced in the tens of thousands at a low individual cost and due to the [[Bakumatsu|opening up of Japan]] after 1853 were popular both in Japan and Europe where they had a [[Japonism|huge influence]] on the future [[Impressionist]] artists.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3669308/Hiroshige-Master-printmaker-still-making-waves.html Hiroshige: Master printmaker still making waves]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japonisme"&gt;{{cite book |author1=G.P.

'''Symphony No. 4''', in E minor is an orchestral composition by the Romanian composer [[George Enescu]], left incomplete at the composer's death, but finished in 1996 by [[Pascal Bentoiu]].
	
==History==
Enescu began sketching his Fourth Symphony in 1928, but did not return to it in earnest until after completing the orchestration of his opera ''[[Œdipe (opera)|Œdipe]]'' in 1931. Although he worked on the symphony from 1932, he broke off work in December 1934 after achieving a complete draft and a partial orchestration. He briefly resumed work in the spring of 1939, but it remained incomplete at his death ({{harvnb|Bentoiu|2010|loc=522}}; {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=189, 206}}).

Enescu made two orchestrated drafts of the first movement. The first is undated, while the second one, dated 20 October {{harv|Zottoviceanu, Rațiu, and Marbe|1971|loc=712, 751}} (or possibly 20 December according to {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=206, 275}}) 1934, also continues the orchestration into the second movement, extending through about the first quarter of it. After having completed Enescu's [[Symphony No. 5 (Enescu)|Fifth Symphony]] in 1995, Pascal Bentoiu undertook completion of the Fourth as well, and this version was premiered in Bucharest on 2 October 1997 by {{ill|Cristian Mandeal|ro}} conducting the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]] {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=524–25}}. The UK premiere was given in London on 29 April 2017 by Samuel Draper conducting the Oberon Symphony Orchestra {{harv|Clarke|2017}}.

==Analysis==
The symphony has three [[movement (music)|movements]], which are played without pauses in between:
*Allegro apassionato
*Un poco andante, marziale
*Allegro vivace – non troppo
The first movement is in [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]], with the exposition presenting the exceptionally economical matter (only five or six melodic elements) that will account for virtually all of the music in the symphony. The main [[Cyclic form|cyclic]] theme, which will recur in each movement at the same pitch and in the same instrument, first appears in the trumpet at rehearsal number 21. The [[Development (music)|development]] section is comparatively short, but this will be compensated by further extensive development in the finale. The [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] brings back the two main themes in reverse order. The second theme, originally presented in the solo flute, returns in a blaze of orchestral colour, while the first theme group is represented mainly by what was originally a [[Bridge (music)#Classical music|bridge]] idea {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=525–27}}. This first movement, although completed by Enescu, cannot be regarded on its own, nor did the composer conceive it as such. Even in its unfinished form, the second movement (Un poco andante, marziale) follows without interruption and represents, in its thematic character, a continuation of the initial movement {{harv|Zottoviceanu, Rațiu, and Marbe|1971|loc=751}}.

The second movement develops further both of the theme groups from the first movement, in a march character that builds steadily to a climax at rehearsal number 49 and then subsides to a whisper in a solo string quartet, specified by the composer in the short-score sketch. The movement ends inconclusively, with a tremolo in the strings, cymbals, and harp that leads directly into the finale {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=527–28}}.

The finale is difficult to assign to a definite form. Although there are passages with expository and developmental aspects, its overall function is the recapitulation of all the material from the previous two movements. After a certain point, Enescu turns his attention to breaking up the rhythms within the {{Music|time|3|4}} metre, first into twos, then fours, fives, nines, and tens, as well as superimposing them until finally the underlying ternary rhythm is broken and transformed into a binary metre {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=529}}.

'''''The Adoration of the Golden Calf''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], produced between 1633 and 1634. It depicts the adoration of the [[golden calf]] by the Israelites, from chapter 32 of the [[Book of Exodus]]. It was made as part of a pair of paintings (the other being ''[[The Crossing of the Red Sea (Poussin)|The Crossing of the Red Sea]]'') commissioned by Amadeo dal Pozzo, Marchese di Voghera of Turin, a cousin to [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], Poussin's main sponsor in Rome. By 1685 the pair had passed to the Chevalier de Lorraine and in 1710 they were bought by Benigne de Ragois de Bretonvillers. In 1741 they were bought from Samuel by [[Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone|Sir Jacob Bouverie]], whose son [[William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor|William]] became the first [[Earl of Radnor]]. The Earls of Radnor owned the pair from then until 1945, when it was split for the first time and ''The Adoration of the Golden Calf'' bought by the [[National Gallery]] in London for £10,000, half of which was contributed by the [[Art Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfund.org/artwork/1532/the-adoration-of-the-golden-calf&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Crossing of the Red Sea'' was bought in the same 1945 sale by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].) It now hangs in Room 19 of the National Gallery, where it and Poussin's ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'' were vandalised with red spray paint on 17 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/17/poussin-attack-national-gallery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14185800&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bacchanal of the Andrians''''' is an oil painting by [[Titian]]. It is signed "&lt;small&gt;TICIANUS F&lt;/small&gt;.[aciebat]" and is dated to 1523–1526.&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enciclopedia online |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/bacanal-de-los-andrios-la/?no_cache=1|work=Bacanal de los andrios|publisher=Museo del Prado|accessdate=2 December 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is now held at the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], but it was commissioned by [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]] for his ''[[Camerini d'alabastro]]'' ('chambers of alabaster') in [[Ferrara]].  The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating [[Bacchus]] and Venus, the gods of wine and love.

''The Bacchanal of the Andrians'' has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it.

'''Viking art''', also known commonly as '''Norse art''', is a term widely accepted for the [[art]] of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Norsemen]] and [[Vikings|Viking]] settlements further afield—particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]]—during the [[Viking Age]] of the 8th-11th centuries CE. Viking art has many design elements in common with [[Celtic Art|Celtic]], [[Migration Period art|Germanic]], the later [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and Eastern European art, sharing many influences with each of these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;*Maurizio Tani, ''Le origini mediterranee ed eurasiatiche dell’arte vichinga. Casi esemplari dall’Islanda'', in ''Studi Nordici'' (Roma), XIII, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the current knowledge of Viking art relies heavily upon more durable objects of [[metal]] and [[stone]]; [[wood]], [[bone]], [[ivory]] and [[textiles]] are more rarely preserved; [[human skin]], which historical sources indicate was often elaborately [[tattoo]]ed, is nowhere extant and is unlikely to have survived. The artistic record therefore, as it has survived to the present day, remains significantly incomplete. Ongoing [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and opportunistic finds, of course, may improve this situation in the future, as indeed they have in the recent past.

Viking art is usually divided into a sequence of roughly chronological styles, although outside Scandinavia itself local influences are often strong, and the development of styles can be less clear.  

==Historical context==
[[File:Viking - Whale-Bone Plaque - Walters 711169.jpg|thumb|Decorated plaque in [[whale bone]], 8th–late 9th century, 22×18.3×0.8 cm (8.7×7.2×0.3 in)]]
The Vikings' regional origins lay in Scandinavia, the northern-most peninsula of continental Europe, while the term 'Viking' likely derived from their own term for coastal raiding—the activity by which many neighbouring cultures became acquainted with the inhabitants of the region.

Viking raiders attacked wealthy targets on the north-western coasts of Europe from the late 8th until the mid-11th century CE. Pre-Christian traders and sea raiders, the Vikings first enter recorded history with their attack on the Christian monastic community on [[Lindisfarne]] Island in 793.

The Vikings initially employed their [[longship]]s to invade and attack European coasts, harbours and river settlements on a seasonal basis.  Subsequently, Viking activities diversified to include trading voyages to the east, west and south of their Scandinavian homelands, with repeated and regular voyages following river systems east into [[Russia]] and the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]] regions, and west to the coastlines of the [[British Isles]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Evidence exists for Vikings reaching [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] well before the later voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the [[New World]].

Trading and merchant activities were accompanied by settlement and colonisation in many of these territories.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kleiner, Gardner's Art Through The Ages: The Western Perspective, Volume I, 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==By material==
===Wood and organic materials===
[[File:La pared original de la Urnes stavkyrkje (I).jpg|thumb|Wood carving at Urnes Stave Church in Norway—a rare survival.]]
Wood was undoubtedly the primary material of choice for Viking artists, being relatively easy to carve, inexpensive and abundant in northern Europe. The importance of wood as an artistic medium is underscored by chance survivals of wood artistry at the very beginning and end of the Viking period, namely, the [[Oseberg ship|Oseberg ship-burial]] carvings of the early 9th century and the carved decoration of the [[Urnes Stave Church]] from the 12th century. As summarised by [[James Graham-Campbell]]: "These remarkable survivals allow us to form at least an impression of what we are missing from original corpus of Viking art, although wooden fragments and small-scale carvings in other materials (such as antler, amber and walrus ivory) provide further hints. The same is inevitably true of the textile arts, although weaving and embroidery were clearly well-developed crafts."&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell, J., ''Viking Art'', 2013, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone===
With the exception of the [[Picture stone|Gotlandic picture stones]] prevalent in Sweden early in the Viking period, stone carving was apparently not practised elsewhere in Scandinavia until the mid-10th century and the creation of the royal monuments at [[Jelling]] in [[Denmark]]. Subsequently, and likely influenced by the spread of Christianity, the use of carved stone for permanent memorials became more prevalent.

Beyond the discontinuous artifactual records of wood and stone, the reconstructed history of Viking art to date relies most on the study of decoration of ornamental [[metalwork]] from a great variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell, J., ''Viking Art'', 2013, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of archaeological context have succeeded in preserving metal objects for present study, while the durability of [[precious metal]]s in particular has preserved much artistic expression and endeavour.

Jewellery was worn by both men and women, though of different types. Married women fastened their overdresses near the shoulder with matching pairs of large brooches. Modern scholars often call them "tortoise brooches" because of their domed shape. The shapes and styles of women's paired brooches varied regionally, but many used [[openwork]]. Women often strung metal chains or strings of beads between the brooches, or suspended ornaments from the bottom of the brooches. Men wore rings on their fingers, arms and necks, and held their cloaks closed with [[penannular brooch]]es, often with extravagantly long pins. Their weapons were often richly decorated on areas such as sword [[hilt]]s. The Vikings mostly used silver or bronze jewellery, the latter sometimes [[gilding|gilded]], but a small number of large and lavish pieces or sets in solid gold have been found, probably belonging to royalty or major figures.

Decorated metalwork of an everyday nature is frequently recovered from Viking period [[grave]]s, on account of the widespread practice of making burials accompanied by [[grave good]]s. The deceased was dressed in their best clothing and jewellery, and was interred with weapons, tools, and household goods. Less common, but significant nonetheless, are finds of precious metal objects in the form of treasure [[hoard]]s, many apparently concealed for safe-keeping by owners later unable to recover their contents, although some may have been deposited as offerings to the gods.

Recently, given the increasing popularity and legality of [[metal-detecting]], an increasing frequency of single, chance finds of metal objects and ornaments (most probably representing accidental losses) is creating a fast expanding corpus of new material for study.

[[Viking coinage|Viking coins]] fit well into this latter category, but nonetheless form a separate category of Viking period artefact, their design and decoration largely independent of the developing styles characteristic of wider Viking artistic endeavour.

===Other sources===
A non-visual source of information for Viking art lies in [[skaldic verse]], the complex form of oral poetry composed during the Viking Age and passed on until written down centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell, J., ''Viking Art'', 2013, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Several verses speak of painted forms of decoration that have but rarely survived on wood and stone. The 9th century skald poet [[Bragi Boddason]], for example, cites four apparently unrelated scenes painted on a shield. One of these scenes depicted the god [[Thor]]'s fishing expedition, which motif is also referenced in a 10th-century poem by [[Úlfr Uggason]] describing the paintings in a newly constructed hall in Iceland.

==Origins and background==
A continuous artistic tradition common to most of north-western Europe and developing from the 4th century CE formed the foundations on which Viking Age art and decoration were built: from that period onwards, the output of Scandinavian artists was broadly focused on varieties of convoluted animal ornamentation used to decorate a wide variety of objects.

The art historian [[Bernhard Salin]] was the first to systematise Germanic animal ornament, dividing it into three styles (I, II and III).&lt;ref&gt;Salin 1904&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two were subsequently subdivided by Arwidsson&lt;ref&gt;Arwidsson 1942a, 1942b&lt;/ref&gt; into three further styles: Style C, flourishing during the 7th century and into the 8th century, before being largely replaced (especially in southern Scandinavia) by Style D. Styles C and D provided the inspiration for the initial expression of animal ornament within the Viking Age, Style E, commonly known as the Oseberg / Broa Style. Both Styles D and E developed within a broad Scandinavian context which, although in keeping with north-western European animal ornamentation generally, exhibited little influence from beyond Scandinavia.

==Scholarship==
Although preliminary formulations were made in the late 19th century, the history of Viking art first achieved maturity in the early 20th century with the detailed publication of the ornate wood-carvings discovered in 1904 as part of the Oserberg ship-burial by the Norwegian archaeologist [[Haakon Shetelig]].

Importantly, it was the English archaeologist [[David M. Wilson]], working with his Danish colleague Ole Klindt-Jensen to produce the 1966 survey work ''Viking Art'', who created foundations for the systematic characterisation of the field still employed today, together with a developed chronological framework.

David Wilson continued to produce mostly English-language studies on Viking art in subsequent years, joined over recent decades by the Norwegian art-historian [[Signe Horn Fuglesang]] with her own series of important publications. Together these scholars have combined authority with accessibility to promote the increasing understanding of Viking art as a cultural expression.

==Styles==
[[File:Kunststile der Wikingerzeit.jpg|thumb|360px|Timeline for the Norse animal styles.]]

The art of the [[Viking Age]] is organised into a loose sequence of stylistic phases which, despite significant overlap in style and chronology, may be defined and distinguished on account both of formal design elements and of recurring compositions and motifs:
* [[Oseberg Style]]
* [[Borre Style]]
* [[Jellinge Style]]
* [[Mammen Style]]
* [[Ringerike Style]]
* [[Urnes Style]]

Unsurprisingly, these stylistic phases appear in their purest form in Scandinavia itself; elsewhere in the Viking world, notable admixtures from external cultures and influences frequently appear. In the British Isles, for example, art historians identify distinct, 'Insular' versions of Scandinavian motifs, often directly alongside 'pure' Viking decoration.

===Oseberg Style===
[[File:Oseberg.JPG|thumbnail|upright|The Oseberg Viking Ship at the Viking Ship Museum, Oslo.]]
The '''Oseberg Style''' characterises the initial phase in what has been considered Viking art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=broa-oseberg-style ''The Broa/Oseberg Style'' (Viking Art Styles)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201190117/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=broa-oseberg-style |date=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oseberg Style takes its name from the [[Oseberg Ship]] grave, a well-preserved and highly decorated [[longship]] discovered in a large burial mound at the Oseberg farm near [[Tønsberg]] in [[Vestfold]], [[Norway]], which also contained a number of other richly decorated wooden objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingrune.com/2009/10/oseberg-viking-ship/ ''Viking Ship from Oseberg'' (The Viking Rune: All Things Norse)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic motif of the Oseberg Style is the so-called ''gripping beast''. The gripping beast motif is what clearly distinguishes the early Viking art from the styles that preceded it. The chief features of the gripping beast are the paws that grip the borders around it, neighbouring beasts or parts of its own body. 

Currently located at the [[Viking Ship Museum (Oslo)|Viking Ship Museum]], [[Bygdøy]], and over 70 feet long, the [[Oseberg Ship]] held the remains of two women and many precious objects that were probably removed by robbers early before it was found.The Oseberg ship itself is decorate with a more traditional style of animal interlace that does not feature the gripping beast motif. However, five carved wooden animal-head posts were found in the ship, and the one known as the ''Carolingian animal-head post'' is decorated with gripping beasts, as are other grave goods from the ship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sinbaek |first1=Soren |title=Enter the Gripping Beast |date=2012 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports International Series |url=http://www.academia.edu/1973560/Enter_the_Gripping_Beast._Artistic_innovation_and_social_networks_in_Viking-period_towns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carolingian head represents a snarling beast, possibly a wolf, with surface ornamentation in the form of interwoven animals that twist and turn as they are gripping and snapping.   

The Oseberg style is also characterized by traditions from the [[Vendel era]], and it is nowadays not always accepted as an independent style.&lt;ref name="djur"&gt;The article ''djurornamentik'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Borre Style===
[[File:Haithabu Gewandfibel Borrestil.JPG|thumb|upright|Bronze pendant from [[Hedeby]] (Haithabu) ]]
'''Borre Style''' embraces a range of geometric interlace / knot patterns and zoomorphic (single animal) motifs, first recognised in a group of gilt-bronze [[Horse harness|harness]] mounts recovered from a [[Ship burial|ship grave]] in [[Borre mound cemetery]] near the village of [[Borre, Norway|Borre]], [[Vestfold]], [[Norway]], and from which the name of the style derives. Borre Style prevailed in Scandinavia from the late 9th through to the late 10th century, a timeframe supported by dendrochronological data supplied from sites with characteristically Borre Style artifacts&lt;ref&gt;Dated Borre sites include Borre (c. 900), Gokstad (900–905), Tune (905–910), Fyrkat (980) and Trelleborg (980/1), as well as several coin-dated hoards; cf. Bonde and Christensen 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'gripping beast' with a ribbon-shaped body continues as a characteristic of this and earlier styles. As with geometric patterning in this phase, the visual thrust of the Borre Style results from the filling of available space: ribbon animal plaits are tightly interlaced and animal bodies are arranged to create tight, closed compositions. As a result, any background is markedly absent – a characteristic of the Borre Style that contrasts strongly with the more open and fluid compositions that prevailed in the overlapping Jellinge Style.

A more particular diagnostic feature of Borre Style lies in a symmetrical, double-contoured 'ring-chain' (or 'ring-braid'), whose composition consists of interlaced circles separated by transverse bars and a [[lozenge]] overlay. The Borre ring-chain occasionally terminates with an animal head in high relief, as seen on strap fittings from Borre and Gokstad.

The ridges of designs in metalwork are often nicked to imitate the filigree wire employed in the finest pieces of craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/b/borre_style.aspx ''Borre style'' (Trustees of the British Museum)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jellinge Style===
The '''Jellinge Style''' is a phase of [[Scandinavia]]n [[animal style|animal art]] during the 10th century.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;The article ''jellingestil'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The style is characterized by markedly stylized and often band-shaped bodies of animals.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt; It was originally applied to a complex of objects in [[Jelling]], [[Denmark]], such as [[Harald Bluetooth]]'s great runestone, but later research categorize them as Mammen style.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Varby-jelling.gif
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mammen Style===
[[File:Mammen-axt.gif|thumb|upright|The axe head from Mammen. Iron with silver engraving.]]

'''Mammen Style''' takes its name from its type object, an axe recovered from a wealthy male burial marked a mound (Bjerringhø) at [[Mammen]], in [[Jutland]], Denmark (on the basis of dendrochronology, the wood used in construction of the grave chamber was felled in winter 970–971). Richly decorated on both sides with inlaid silver designs, the iron axe was probably a ceremonial parade weapon that was the property of a man of princely status, his burial clothes bearing elaborate embroidery and trimmed with silk and fur.

[[File:Camminskrinet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A replica of the original but lost Cammin Chest, a small late-Viking period golden [[reliquary]] in the Mammen style ([[Nationalmuseet]]).]]
On one face, the Mammen axe features a large bird with pelleted body, crest, circular eye, and upright head and beak with lappet. A large shell-spiral marks the bird's hip, from which point its thinly elongated wings emerge: the right wing interlaces with the bird's neck, while the left wing interlaces with its body and tail. The outer wing edge displays a semi-circular nick typical of Mammen Style design. The tail is rendered as a triple tendril, the particular treatment of which on the Mammen axe – with open, hook-like ends – forming a characteristic of the Mammen Style as a whole. Complicating the design is the bird's head-lappet, interlacing twice with neck and right wing, whilst also sprouting tendrils along the blade edge. At the top, near the haft, the Mammen axe features an interlaced knot on one side, a triangular human mask (with large nose, moustache and spiral beard) on the other; the latter would prove a favoured Mammen Style motif carried over from earlier styles.

On the other side, the Mammen axe bears a spreading foliate (leaf) design, emanating from spirals at the base with thin, 'pelleted' tendrils spreading and intertwining across the axe head towards the haft.

===Ringerike Style===

The Ringerike Style receives its name from the [[Ringerike (traditional district)|Ringerike]] district north of [[Oslo]], Norway, where the local reddish [[sandstone]] was widely employed for carving stones with designs of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Only one stone carved in this style, however, has been found in Ringerike itself, at Tanberg, cf. Fugelesang 1980:pl.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vangsteinen.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Vang Stone]]
The type object most commonly used to define Ringerike Style is a {{convert|2.15|m|adj=on}} high [[Vang stone|carved stone]] from [[Vang, Oppland|Vang]] in [[Oppland]]. Apart from a runic memorial inscription on its right edge, the main field of the Vang Stone is filled with a balanced [[tendril]] ornament springing from two shell spirals at the base: the main stems cross twice to terminate in lobed tendrils. At the crossing, further tendrils spring from loops and pear-shaped motifs appear from the tendril centres on the upper loop. Although axial in conception, a basic asymmetry arises in the deposition of the tendrils. Surmounting the tendril pattern appears a large striding animal in double-contoured rendering with spiral hips and a lip lappet. Comparing the Vang Stone animal design with the related animal from the Mammen axe-head, the latter lacks the axiality seen in the Vang Stone and its tendrils are far less disciplined: the Mammen scroll is wavy, while the Vang scroll appears taut and evenly curved, these features marking a key difference between Mammen and Ringerike ornament. The inter-relationship between the two styles is obvious, however, when comparing the Vang Stone animal with that found on the [[Jelling Stone]].

[[File:Söderala weathervane.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The Söderala weathervane.]]
With regard to metalwork, Ringerike Style is best seen in two copper-gilt [[weather-vane]]s, from Källunge, Gotland and from Söderala, Hälsingland, both in Sweden. The former displays one face two axially-constructed loops in the form of snakes, which in turn sprout symmetrically-placed tendrils. The snake heads, as well as the animal and snake on the reverse, find more florid treatment than on the Vang Stone: all have lip lappets, the snakes bear pigtails, while all animals have a pear-shaped eye with the point directed towards the snout – a diagnostic feature of Ringerike Style.

The '''Ringerike Style''' is a [[Scandinavia]]n [[animal style]] from the late 10th century and the 11th century, which evolved out of the earlier [[Mammen Style]]. It has received its name from a group of [[runestone]]s with animal and plant [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in the [[Ringerike (traditional district)|Ringerike]] district north of [[Oslo]]. The most common motifs are lions, birds, band-shaped animals and spirals. Some elements appear for the first time in Scandinavian art, such as different types of crosses, palmettes and pretzel-shaped nooses that tie together two motifs.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt; Most of the motifs have counterparts in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and [[Ottonian art]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Urnes Style===
[[Image:Kbh Mus Bronzespange.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze ornament from [[Denmark]].]]

The '''Urnes Style''' was the last phase of [[Scandinavia]]n [[animal style|animal art]] during the second half of the 11th century and in the early 12th century.&lt;ref name="national-2"&gt;The article ''urnesstil'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Urnes Style is named after the northern gate of the [[Urnes stave church]] in [[Norway]], but most objects in the style are [[runestone]]s in [[Uppland]], [[Sweden]], which is why some scholars prefer to call it the ''[[Runestone styles|Runestone style]]''.&lt;ref name="national-2"/&gt;

The style is characterized by slim and stylised animals that are interwoven into tight patterns.&lt;ref name="national-2"/&gt; The animals heads are seen in profile, they have slender almond-shaped eyes and there are upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks.&lt;ref name="national-2"/&gt;

[[Image:Urnesportalen.jpg|thumb|upright|The eponymous carving on the [[Urnes stave church]] is an example of the last Urnes Style stage.]]

====Early Urnes Style====
The early style has received a dating which is mainly based on [[Orkesta Runestones#U 343|runestone U 343]], [[England Runestones#U 344|runestone U 344]] and a silver bowl from c. 1050, which was found at Lilla Valla.&lt;ref name="sig206"/&gt; The early version of this style on runestones comprises [[England Runestones]] referring to the [[Danegeld]] and [[Canute the Great]] and works by [[Åsmund Kåresson]].&lt;ref name="sig206"&gt;Fuglesang, S.H. ''Swedish runestones of the eleventh century: ornament and dating'', Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplinärer Forschung (K.Düwel ed.). Göttingen 1998, pp. 197–218. p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-Urnes Style====
The mid-Urnes Style has received a relatively firm dating based on its appearance on coins issued by [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] (1047–1066) and by [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] (1080–1090). Two wood carvings from [[Oslo]] have been dated to c. 1050–1100 and the Hørning plank is dated by [[dendrochronology]] to c. 1060–1070.&lt;ref name="sig207"/&gt; There is, however, evidence suggesting that the mid-Urnes style was developed before 1050 in the manner it is represented by the [[runemaster]]s [[Fot]] and [[Balle (runemaster)|Balli]].&lt;ref name="sig207"/&gt;

====Late Urnes Style====
The mid-Urnes Style would stay popular side-by-side with the late Urnes style of the [[runemaster]] [[Öpir]].&lt;ref name="sig207"/&gt; He is famous for a style in which the animals are extremely thin and make circular patterns in open compositions.&lt;ref name="sig207"/&gt; This style was not unique to Öpir and Sweden, but it also appears on a plank from Bølstad and on a chair from [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="sig207"/&gt;

The [[Jarlabanke Runestones]] show traits both from this late style and from the mid-Urnes style of Fot and Balli, and it was the Fot-Balli type that would mix with the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="sig207"&gt;Fuglesang, S.H. ''Swedish runestones of the eleventh century: ornament and dating'', Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplinärer Forschung (K.Düwel ed.). Göttingen 1998, pp. 197–218. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urnes-Romanesque Style====
The Urnes-Romanesque Style does not appear on runestones which suggests that the tradition of making runestones had died out when the mixed style made its appearance since it is well represented in [[Gotland]] and on the Swedish mainland.&lt;ref name="sig208"/&gt; The Urnes-Romanesque Style can be dated independently of style thanks to representations from [[Oslo]] in the period 1100–1175, dendrochronological dating of the [[Lisbjerg]] frontal in [[Denmark]] to 1135, as well as Irish reliquaries that are dated to the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="sig208"&gt;Fuglesang, S.H. ''Swedish runestones of the eleventh century: ornament and dating'', Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplinärer Forschung (K.Düwel ed.). Göttingen 1998, pp. 197–218. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Sutermeister''' (1868–1939) is a [[Swiss]] [[writer]] well known for his [[spoonerism]]s.

== Life ==

Werner Sutermeister was a son of Ernestine Moehrlen and [[Otto Sutermeister]].&lt;ref&gt;''Der fröhliche Apfelbaum, geschüttelt von Werner Sutermeister.'' Bern: Hans Huber, 1932. {{ISBN|3-7185-0383-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended [[Gymnasium Kirchenfeld]] in [[Berne]]. He then studied [[history]], [[German philology]] and [[philosophy]] in [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Berne|Berne]]. In 1891 he became a teacher for [[secondary school]]s. 1894 he promoted with a dissertation about [[Klemens von Metternich]]’s relationship to [[Switzerland]] between 1840 and 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bernensia.ch/biographien/sutermeister1868.php Biographie on bernensia.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ch/books?id=N9TjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Werner+Sutermeister%22&amp;dq=%22Werner+Sutermeister%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SznkUPD7LoWA4gSv4ICwBg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwATgU Recension] in: ''[[Deutsche Literaturzeitung|Deutschen Literaturzeitung für Kritik der Internationalen Wissenschaft]]'', vol. 17, nr. 41–52, [[Weidmannsche Buchhandlung]], 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

For six years he worked as a teacher at the girls' school of Berne. In the spring of 1900 he was elected to the [[Gymnasium of Berne]], where he taught History and German for 37 years. He also directed the orchestra of the Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dübi]]: ''Über den Autor''. In: ''Der fröhliche Apfelbaum, geschüttelt von Werner Sutermeister.'' 2. erweiterte Auflage. [[Gute Schriften]], Bern 1973, Seite 77. {{ISBN|3-7185-0383-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutermeister also wrote for the Bernese daily newspaper ''[[Der Bund]]'':
::''He was a master of light-headed philosophy, and he shook the kaleidoscope of the German language to delight himself and the mischievous coincidences of his rhymes. So he has brought some cheerful, but also some thoughtful note in our newspaper text.''&lt;ref&gt;''Dr. Phil. Werner Sutermeister, alt Gymnasiallehrer in Bern, ist im Alter von 71 Jahren gestorben.'' In: ''[[Der Bund]]'', 20 April 1939, nr. 182, “Abend-Ausgabe”, page 4, with photo.&lt;/ref&gt;
