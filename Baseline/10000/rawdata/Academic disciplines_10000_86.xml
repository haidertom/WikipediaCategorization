'''Anthrozoology''' (also known as '''human–non-human-animal studies''', or''' HAS''') is the subset of [[ethnobiology]] that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with other disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi. and Hurn, Samantha. ''Humans and Other Animals''. Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |date=June 25, 2013 }} Accessed February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term should not be confused with "animal studies," which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrozoology scholars, such as [[Pauleen Bennett]] recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop ''[[sui generis]]'' methods.

* The symbolism of animals in literature and art
* The history of animal [[domestication]]
* The intersections of [[speciesism]], racism, and sexism
* The place of animals in human-occupied spaces

* The critical evaluation of [[animal abuse]] and exploitation
* Mind, self, and [[Personhood#Non-human animals|personhood in nonhuman animals]]
* The potential human health benefits of companion animal ownership

== Growth of the field ==
There are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]], which partners with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processes in Social &amp; Affective Development: Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) Research|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/cdbb/programs/psad/HAI|website=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.

There are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, ''Humanimalia''). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.

In addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.

'''Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics''' (APCTP) is an international non-governmental research institute for physical sciences. It is located in the Campus of the [[Pohang University of Science and Technology]] (POSTECH), in Pohang, South Korea. The centre was founded in 1996 by Nobel Laureate [[Chen-Ning Yang]].

==Structure and history==
The Asia Pacific Theoretical Physics Center is theoretical physics research leading, international joint research programs, in  the Asia-Pacific region. The APCTP  was founded in June 1996 as an international non-governmental organizations, with current member states: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[the Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] (16 countries).
The Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics is a close-knit, multi-disciplinary research environment that hosts scientists working on challenging problems at the forefront of [[biophysics]], [[condensed matter]], [[quantum information]], [[astrophysics]], [[cosmology]] and [[particle physics]]. The institute also plays a key role in Korea by inviting international scholars, acting as a conduit for collaboration through focus workshops and training young scientists.
The APCTP, whose previous presidents include Nobel Laureates C. N. Yang and [[Robert B. Laughlin]], has a rich history and celebrated its 20th year in 2016. In 2008 APCTP established Junior Research Groups (JRG) under a previous president, [[Peter Fulde]], in collaboration with the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Germany]], as a means to provide gifted young scientists with their first opportunity of managing research. The institute currently supports eight JRG groups.

The APCTP is located at the Pohang University for Science and Technology (POSTECH), which in addition to possessing established departments in both mathematics and the natural sciences, ranks globally within the top 100 universities. Moreover, the boutique campus currently boasts the [[POSTECH-Max Planck center for quantum materials]], as well as four centers from the Korean government flagship [[Institute for Basic Science (IBS)]] program, spanning low-dimensional electronic systems, immunology, self-assembly and notably, the only mathematics IBS center to date.

'''Ballochroy''' is a [[megalith]]ic site in [[Kintyre]] on the [[Argyll]] peninsula in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Cope1998"&gt;{{cite book|first=Julian|last= Cope|authorlink=Julian Cope|title=[[The Modern Antiquarian: A Pre-millennial Odyssey Through Megalithic Britain]] : Including a Gazetteer to Over 300 Prehistoric Sites|year=1998|page=349|publisher=Thorsons Pub|isbn=978-0-7225-3599-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three vertical [[rock (geology)|stone]]s, side by side, aligned with various land features {{convert|7|-|19|mi|km|abbr=out|0}} away.

[[Alexander Thom]], known for his work on [[Stonehenge]], maintained that the great length between the stones and the features of distant landscape lent precision to pinpointing the [[midsummer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s for ancient observers.

These three stones are considered the most spectacular set of megalithic monuments that cluster around south Argyll. The three mica schist stones were measured at {{convert|3.5|,|3.0|and|2.0|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in height. It is possible that this last, smallest, stone may have been broken off at the top.  The line of stones is orientated north-east to south-west.

The flat face of the central stone (at right angles to the alignment) indicates the mountain of [[Cora Bheinn]], on the [[Jura, Scotland|island of Jura]], which is {{convert|30|km|mi|disp=flip|abbr=out|0}} away. The shortest stone also faces across the alignment, and points to [[Beinn a' Chaolais]], the southernmost of the three [[Paps of Jura]]. The sun setting here would have given warning of the approach of the solstice.
[[File:Ballochroy, Menhir with Jura in the background.jpg|thumb|Ballochroy, Menhir with [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the background]]
As with many megalithic sites, the current theories concerning the exact use of the stones at Ballochroy are somewhat controversial.

'''Band II''' is the range of radio [[frequency|frequencies]] within the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from 87.5 to 108.0&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz]] (MHz).

== Radio ==
Band II is primarily used worldwide for [[FM broadcasting|FM radio broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="Tooley Circuits"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeeJj7aFzU4C&amp;lpg=SA13-PA17&amp;dq=%22Band%20II%22%20VHF&amp;pg=SA13-PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Band%20II%22%20VHF&amp;f=false | title=Electronic Circuits - Fundamentals &amp; Applications | publisher=Routledge | author=Tooley, Mike | year=2007 | isbn=9781136407383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcast television ==

=== Usage in Russia and in other former members of [[International Radio and Television Organisation|OIRT]] ===

In the former Soviet Union and other countries-members of OIRT, frequencies from 76&amp;nbsp;MHz to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz were designated for broadcast television usage.&lt;ref name="gost7845"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://protect.gost.ru/document.aspx?control=7&amp;id=136235 |page = 10 | title=GOST 7845-92 : Broadcast television system. Main specifications. Methods of measurements. (In Russian) | publisher=Russian Federal agency for technical regulations and measurements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering 8&amp;nbsp;MHz channel bandwidth used by the Russian analog television system ([[Broadcast television systems#ITU standards|System D]]), the following television channels had been defined:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Channel
! Frequency Range
|-
|3||76-84&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|4||84-92&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|5||92-100&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

Broadcast television channels 1 and 2 are assigned to [[VHF I]] band, channels 6 to 12 are assigned to [[VHF III]] band.

Starting from the early 1990s, frequencies previously allotted to television channels 4 and 5 have been re-allocated for FM radio, thereby harmonizing it with the Western allocation for FM radio service.

From an informa[[Informatics|t]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ics perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of four key elements: actors (behavioral subjects and objects), operations (actions, activities) and interactions (relationships), and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector, all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior matrix.

'''Biomass partitioning''' is the process by which [[plant]]s divide their energy amongst their [[Plant anatomy|parts]]. For example, there may be a tradeoff in proteins and carbohydrates allocated towards leaves for [[photosynthesis]] or to roots for the process of nutrient uptake.The study of [[biomass]] partitioning is important to [[crop]] [[plant growth|growth]]. The percentages of partitioning can be determined with the equation &lt;math&gt; (dW/dt)_i = P_{ci} * dW/dt &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605095033/http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 5, 2016 | title=Biomass partitioning | publisher=Ape Simulator | accessdate=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
with ''dW/dt'' is the [[exponential growth|growth rate]] ''(dW/dt)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;ci&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the rates of biomass partitioned and the respective partitioning factor for each [[plant organ]] ''i''.

Overall, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen availability]] has a strong effect on partitioning, with plants growing in low-nitrogen areas partitioning most of their biomass to underground structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cambui CA |author2=Svennerstam H |author3=Gruffman L |author4=Nordin A |author5=Ganeteg U |year=2011|title=Patterns of Plant Biomass Partitioning Depend on Nitrogen Source|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6|issue=4|pages=e19211|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019211|display-authors=etal |pmid=21544211 |pmc=3081341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil nitrogen availability is a strong determinant of biomass allocation. For example, in low productivity systems such as [[Taiga|boreal forests]], trees devote a large portion of their biomass to roots. But as the soil productivity begins to increase, biomass is primarily allocated to aboveground structures such as leaves and stems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an overall pattern, the overall lengths of roots begin to decrease as nitrogen concentrations increase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fuzhong|last2=Bao|first2=Weikai|last3=Li|first3=Fanglan|last4=Wu|first4=Ning|date=2008-05-01|title=Effects of drought stress and N supply on the growth, biomass partitioning and water-use efficiency of Sophora davidii seedlings|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847207002237|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=63|issue=1–3|pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to nitrogen as a factor of plant biomass partitioning, other environmental stressors such as water availability play a role. For example, plants that are growing in dry conditions often have a decreased total biomass production but they also contribute more of their biomass to the roots and develop a higher root:shoot.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When plants allocate more of their biomass to their roots, they are able to enhance water absorption by tapping further down into the [[water table]] as well as extending further laterally with the aid of increased [[Root hair|root hairs.]] But, when there is an extreme soil drought, there is not an increase in root:shoot biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Zhenzhu|last2=Zhou|first2=Guangsheng|last3=Shimizu|first3=Hideyuki|date=2010-06-01|title=Plant responses to drought and rewatering|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=5|issue=6|pages=649–654|doi=10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|issn=1559-2324|pmc=3001553|pmid=20404516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there is a limit to which plant biomass allocation responds to water stress and possibly other environmental factors as well.  It is important for plants to be able to balance their absorption and utilization processes with differing water and nitrogen availabilities because they adjust their growth in order to accommodate the abundances of growth-limiting resources, such as water and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Business Studies''' is an academic subject taught in schools and at [[university]] level in many countries. Its study combines elements of [[accountancy]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], [[organizational studies]] and [[economics]]. '''Business Studies''' is a broad subject in the Social Sciences, allowing the in-depth study of a range of specialties such as accountancy, finance, organisation, [[Human resource management|human resources management]] and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=about_the_subject_1298025420871|title=Business Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries where Business Studies are taught include [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Malta]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tanzania]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]

== United Kingdom ==
=== England ===
Business Studies can be taken as part of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) option for Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11 at [[secondary school]], and also can be taken as part of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] (A-level) course in Year 12 and Year 13. It includes a range of subjects, which give the student general understanding of the various elements of running a business. Subjects covered include, but are not limited to: Business Organization, People in Business, [[Marketing]], Operations &amp; Production, Finance, and [[Strategic Management]].&lt;ref name="BBCBitesize"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zpsvr82 | title=GCSE &gt; Business | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scotland ===
Business management is an option for National 5&lt;ref name="BBCBitesizeNat5"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zd6fcdm | title=National 5 &gt; Business management | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Higher&lt;ref name="BBCBitesizeHigher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/zw26n39 | title=Higher &gt; Business management | work=BBC Bitesize | accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualifications. Both National 5 and Higher exams cover Understanding business, People, Finance, and Marketing and operations.

=== Entry to UK Higher Education ===
The [[University of Cambridge]] considers Business Studies not to be a 'traditional academic subject', although taking Business Studies individually will not disadvantage students as long as it is identified as 'essential' or 'desirable' for the course being applied for. It is also suitable when applying for [[economics]] at university, if the college the candidate comes from does not offer the economics A-level individually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/#course Cambridge University entrance requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hungary ==
After finishing [[secondary school]], students in Hungary have the option of either taking an accredited 2-4 semester business course and obtaining a certificate, or applying to college or university. Students can also take part in a 2-semester preparatory business course to have a greater chance of getting accepted by a university. Hungarian business education has been organized according to the Bologna system since 2006. As the first stage of the multi-cycle educational system, a [[Bachelor’s degree]] can be earned within 6-8 semesters. In case a student wishes to further his or her studies, they can opt for a Master’s program lasting another 2-4 semesters.

== People's Republic of Nepal ==
Business studies programmes are widely taught in the [[Nepal|Republic of Nepal]], where it is taught at every colleges of +2 level and also in colleges that provide A-Levels. A number of universities (public and private) are offering business studies programme under the heading of Business Administration.

== Republic of South Africa ==
''Business Studies'' can be taken as an elective subject from a student's Grade 10 year through to their Grade 12 year.

South Africa has many different standards of Education. Some schools vary in the ''Exam Board'', chosen, to educate their students under. The Governmental Department of Education allow for children to write [[National Senior Certificate|NSC]] Examinations; this Board is the most widely used in South Africa. Students from private schools write [[Independent Examinations Board|IEB]] Exams and are taught under IEB-Standards. Lastly, Business Studies can be taken as part of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], or can be taken as part of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] (A-level) course in Schools run under the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] Board, providing a British education in South Africa. ''Cambridge Schools'' are of the fewest in South Africa. Business Studies includes a range of subjects, which give the student general understanding of the various elements of running a business.

|-
| System || 1.1 || Deploy an automated asset inventory discovery tool and use it to build a preliminary inventory of systems connected to an organization’s public and private network(s). Both active tools that scan through IPv4 or IPv6 network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic should be employed.
|-
| System || 1.2 || If the organization is dynamically assigning addresses using DHCP, then deploy dynamic host configuration protocol&amp;nbsp;(DHCP) server logging, and use this information to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems.
|-
| System || 1.3 || Ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network.
|-
| System || 1.4 || Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device. The inventory should include every system that has an Internet protocol (IP) address on the network, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), printers, storage area networks, Voice Over-IP telephones, multi-homed addresses, virtual addresses, etc.  The asset inventory created must also include data on whether the device is a portable and/or personal device. Devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data must be identified, regardless of whether they are attached to the organization’s network.
|-
| System || 1.5 || Deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network.  The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.
|-
| System || 1.6 || Use client certificates to validate and authenticate systems prior to connecting to the private network.

|-
| System || 2.1 || Devise a list of authorized software and version that is required in the enterprise for each type of system, including servers, workstations, and laptops of various kinds and uses.  This list should be monitored by file integrity checking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified.
|-
| System || 2.2 || Deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system. The whitelist may be very extensive (as is available from commercial whitelist vendors), so that users are not inconvenienced when using common software. Or, for some special-purpose systems (which require only a small number of programs to achieve their needed business functionality), the whitelist may be quite narrow.
|-
| System || 2.3 || Deploy software inventory tools throughout the organization covering each of the operating system types in use, including servers, workstations, and laptops. The software inventory system should track the version of the underlying operating system as well as the applications installed on it. The software inventory systems must be tied into the hardware asset inventory so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location.
|-
| System || 2.4 || Virtual machines and/or air-gapped systems should be used to isolate and run applications that are required for business operations but based on higher risk should not be installed within a networked environment. 
|- id="CSC3"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=16 Critical Security Control #3: Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software]'''
|-
| System || 3.1 || Establish standard secure configurations of your operating systems and software applications. Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. These images should be validated and refreshed on a regular basis to update their security configuration in light of recent vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
|-
| System || 3.2 || Follow strict configuration management, building a secure image that is used to build all new systems that are deployed in the enterprise.  Any existing system that becomes compromised should be re-imaged with the secure build. Regular updates or exceptions to this image should be integrated into the organization’s change management processes.  Images should be created for workstations, servers, and other system types used by the organization.
|-
| System || 3.3 || Store the master images on securely configured servers, validated with integrity checking tools capable of continuous inspection, and change management to ensure that only authorized changes to the images are possible. Alternatively, these master images can be stored in offline machines, air-gapped from the production network, with images copied via secure media to move them between the image storage servers and the production network.
|-
| System || 3.4 || Perform all remote administration of servers, workstation, network devices, and similar equipment over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC.
|-
| System || 3.5 || Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).
|-
| System || 3.6 || Implement and test an automated configuration monitoring system that verifies all remotely testable secure configuration elements, and alerts when unauthorized changes occur. This includes detecting new listening ports, new administrative users, changes to group and local policy objects (where applicable), and new services running on a system. Whenever possible use tools compliant with the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to streamline reporting and integration.
|-
| System || 3.7 || Deploy system configuration management tools, such as Active Directory Group Policy Objects for Microsoft Windows systems or Puppet for UNIX systems that will automatically enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems at regularly scheduled intervals. They should be capable of triggering redeployment of configuration settings on a scheduled, manual, or event-driven basis.
|- id="CSC4"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=20 Critical Security Control #4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation]'''
|-
| System || 4.1 || Run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk.  Use a SCAP-validated vulnerability scanner that looks for both code-based vulnerabilities (such as those described by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entries) and configuration-based vulnerabilities (as enumerated by the Common Configuration Enumeration Project).
|-
| System || 4.2 || Correlate event logs with information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools  is itself logged. Second, personnel should be able to correlate attack detection events with prior vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a target known to be vulnerable.
|-
| System || 4.3 || Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. Use a dedicated account for authenticated vulnerability scans, which should not be used for any other administrative activities and should be tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses.  Ensure that only authorized employees have access to the vulnerability management user interface and that roles are applied to each user.
|-
| System || 4.4 || Subscribe to vulnerability intelligence services in order to stay aware of emerging exposures, and use the information gained from this subscription to update the organization’s vulnerability scanning activities on at least a monthly basis.  Alternatively, ensure that the vulnerability scanning tools you use are regularly updated with all relevant important security vulnerabilities.
|-
| System || 4.5 || Deploy automated patch management tools and software update tools for operating system and software/applications on all systems for which such tools are available and safe.  Patches should be applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped.
|-
| System || 4.6 || Monitor logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure that this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans.  
|-
| System || 4.7 || Compare the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk.
|-
| System || 4.8 || Establish a process to risk-rate vulnerabilities based on the exploitability and potential impact of the vulnerability, and segmented by appropriate groups of assets (example, DMZ servers, internal network servers, desktops, laptops).  Apply patches for the riskiest vulnerabilities first.  A phased rollout can be used to minimize the impact to the organization. Establish expected patching timelines based on the risk rating level.

|-
| System || 5.1 || Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required.  Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior.
|-
| System || 5.2 || Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.
|-
| System || 5.3 || Before deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.
|-
| System || 5.4 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators’ group, or when a new local administrator account is added on a system.
|-
| System || 5.5 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert on any unsuccessful login to an administrative account.
|-
| System || 5.6 || Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access.  Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, biometrics, or other similar authentication methods.
|-
| System || 5.7 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters). 
|-
| System || 5.8 || Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems.
|-
| System || 5.9 || Administrators shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access.

|-
| System || 6.1 || Include at least two synchronized time sources from which all servers and network equipment retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent.
|-
| System || 6.2 || Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.
|-
| System || 6.3 || Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals.  The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.
|-
| System || 6.4 || Have security personnel and/or system administrators run biweekly reports that identify anomalies in logs. They should then actively review the anomalies, documenting their findings.
|-
| System || 6.5 || Configure network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device.
|-
| System || 6.6 || Deploy a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or log analytic tools for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple machines and for log correlation and analysis.  Using the SIEM tool, system administrators and security personnel should devise profiles of common events from given systems so that they can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analysts with insignificant alerts.

|-
| System || 7.1 || Ensure that only fully supported web browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the organization, ideally only using the latest version of the browsers provided by the vendor in order to take advantage of the latest security functions and fixes.
|-
| System || 7.2 || Uninstall or disable any unnecessary or unauthorized browser or email client plugins or add-on applications. Each plugin shall utilize application / URL whitelisting and only allow the use of the application for pre-approved domains.
|-
| System || 7.3 || Limit the use of unnecessary scripting languages in all web browsers and email clients. This includes the use of languages such as ActiveX and JavaScript on systems where it is unnecessary to support such capabilities.
|-
| System || 7.4 || Log all URL requests from each of the organization's systems, whether onsite or a mobile device, in order to identify potentially malicious activity and assist incident handlers with identifying potentially compromised systems.
|-
| System || 7.5 || Deploy two separate browser configurations to each system. One configuration should disable the use of all plugins, unnecessary scripting languages, and generally be configured with limited functionality and be used for general web browsing. The other configuration shall allow for more browser functionality but should only be used to access specific websites that require the use of such functionality.
|-
| System || 7.6 || The organization shall maintain and enforce network based URL filters that limit a system's ability to connect to websites not approved by the organization. The organization shall subscribe to URL categorization services to ensure that they are up-to-date with the most recent website category definitions available. Uncategorized sites shall be blocked by default. This filtering shall be enforced for each of the organization's systems, whether they are physically at an organization's facilities or not.
|-
| System || 7.7 || To lower the chance of spoofed e-mail messages, implement the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) by deploying SPF records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers.
|-
| System || 7.8 || Scan and block all e-mail attachments entering the organization's e-mail gateway if they contain malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for the organization's business. This scanning should be done before the e-mail is placed in the user's inbox. This includes e-mail content filtering and web content filtering.

|-
| System || 8.1 || Employ automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers.
|-
| System || 8.2 || Employ anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or have administrators manually push updates to all machines. After applying an update, automated systems should verify that each system has received its signature update.
|-
| System || 8.3 || Limit use of external devices to those with an approved, documented business need. Monitor for use and attempted use of external devices. Configure laptops, workstations, and servers so that they will not auto-run content from removable media, like USB tokens (i.e., “thumb drives”), USB hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, external serial advanced technology attachment devices, and mounted network shares. Configure systems so that they automatically conduct an anti-malware scan of removable media when inserted.
|-
| System || 8.4 || Enable anti-exploitation features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), virtualization/containerization, etc. For increased protection, deploy capabilities such as Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) that can be configured to apply these protections to a broader set of applications and executables.
|-
| System || 8.5 || Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.
|-
| System || 8.6 || Enable domain name system (DNS) query logging to detect hostname lookup for known malicious C2 domains.

|-
| System || 9.1 || Ensure that only ports, protocols, and services with validated business needs are running on each system.
|-
| System || 9.2 || Apply host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed.
|-
| System || 9.3 || Perform automated port scans on a regular basis against all key servers and compared to a known effective baseline.  If a change that is not listed on the organization’s approved baseline is discovered, an alert should be generated and reviewed.
|-
| System || 9.4 || Verify any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network, and if it is not required for business purposes, move it to an internal VLAN and give it a private address.
|-
| System || 9.5 || Operate critical services on separate physical or logical host machines, such as DNS, file, mail, web, and database servers.
|-
| System || 9.6 || Place application firewalls in front of any critical servers to verify and validate the traffic going to the server.  Any unauthorized services or traffic should be blocked and an alert generated.

|-
| System || 10.1 || Ensure that each system is automatically backed up on at least a weekly basis, and more often for systems storing sensitive information. To help ensure the ability to rapidly restore a system from backup, the operating system, application software, and data on a machine should each be included in the overall backup procedure. These three components of a system do not have to be included in the same backup file or use the same backup software. There should be multiple backups over time, so that in the event of malware infection, restoration can be from a version that is believed to predate the original infection. All backup policies should be compliant with any regulatory or official requirements.
|-
| System || 10.2 || Test data on backup media on a regular basis by performing a data restoration process to ensure that the backup is properly working.
|-
| System || 10.3 || Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network.  This includes remote backups and cloud services.
|-
| System || 10.4 || Ensure that key systems have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls.  This will mitigate the risk of attacks like CryptoLocker which seek to encrypt or damage data on all addressable data shares, including backup destinations.
|- id="CSC11"

|-
| Network || 11.1 || Compare firewall, router, and switch configuration against standard secure configurations defined for each type of network device in use in the organization. The security configuration of such devices should be documented, reviewed, and approved by an organization change control board. Any deviations from the standard configuration or updates to the standard configuration should be documented and approved in a change control system.
|-
| Network || 11.2 || All new configuration rules beyond a baseline-hardened configuration that allow traffic to flow through network security devices, such as firewalls and network-based IPS, should be documented and recorded in a configuration management system, with a specific business reason for each change, a specific individual’s name responsible for that business need, and an expected duration of the need.
|-
| Network || 11.3 || Use automated tools to verify standard device configurations and detect changes. All alterations to such files should be logged and automatically reported to security personnel.
|-
| Network || 11.4 || Manage network devices using two-factor authentication and encrypted sessions.
|-
| Network || 11.5 || Install the latest stable version of any security-related updates on all network devices.
|-
| Network || 11.6 || Network engineers shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 11.7 || Manage the network infrastructure across network connections that are separated from the business use of that network, relying on separate VLANs or, preferably, on entirely different physical connectivity for management sessions for network devices.
|- id="CSC12"

|-
| Network || 12.1 || Deny communications with (or limit data flow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites (whitelists). Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters. Lists of bogon addresses are publicly available on the Internet from various sources, and indicate a series of IP addresses that should not be used for legitimate traffic traversing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 12.2 || On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built into the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border.  This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.
|-
| Network || 12.3 || Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.
|-
| Network || 12.4 || Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signatures or the behavior of potential attacks.  As attacks become automated, methods such as IDS typically delay the amount of time it takes for someone to react to an attack.  A properly configured network-based IPS can provide automation to block bad traffic. When evaluating network-based IPS products, include those using techniques other than signature-based detection (such as virtual machine or sandbox-based approaches) for consideration.
|-
| Network || 12.5 || Design and implement network perimeters so that all outgoing network traffic to the Internet must pass through at least one application layer filtering proxy server. The proxy should support decrypting network traffic, logging individual TCP sessions, blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a black list, and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites.  Organizations should force outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.
|-
| Network || 12.6 || Require all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems) to use two-factor authentication.
|-
| Network || 12.7 || All enterprise devices remotely logging into the internal network should be managed by the enterprise, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels. For third-party devices (e.g., subcontractors/vendors), publish minimum security standards for access to the enterprise network and perform a security scan before allowing access.
|-
| Network || 12.8 || Periodically scan for back-channel connections to the Internet that bypass the DMZ, including unauthorized VPN connections and dual-homed hosts connected to the enterprise network and to other networks via wireless, dial-up modems, or other mechanisms.  
|-
| Network || 12.9 || Deploy NetFlow collection and analysis to DMZ network flows to detect anomalous activity.
|-
| Network || 12.10 || To help identify covert channels exfiltrating data through a firewall, configure the built-in firewall session tracking mechanisms included in many commercial firewalls to identify TCP sessions that last an unusually long time for the given organization and firewall device, alerting personnel about the source and destination addresses associated with these long sessions.

|-
| Network || 13.1 || Perform an assessment of data to identify sensitive information that requires the application of encryption and integrity controls
|-
| Network || 13.2 || Deploy approved hard drive encryption software to mobile devices and systems that hold sensitive data.
|-
| Network || 13.3 || Deploy an automated tool on network perimeters that monitors for sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information), keywords, and other document characteristics to discover unauthorized attempts to exfiltrate data across network boundaries and block such transfers while alerting information security personnel. 
|-
| Network || 13.4 || Conduct periodic scans of server machines using automated tools to determine whether sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information, health, credit card, or classified information) is present on the system in clear text. These tools, which search for patterns that indicate the presence of sensitive information, can help identify if a business or technical process is leaving behind or otherwise leaking sensitive information.
|-
| Network || 13.5 || If there is no business need for supporting such devices, configure systems so that they will not write data to USB tokens or USB hard drives. If such devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow only specific USB devices (based on serial number or other unique property) to be accessed, and that can automatically encrypt all data placed on such devices. An inventory of all authorized devices must be maintained.
|-
| Network || 13.6 || Use network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network. Any anomalies that exceed the normal traffic patterns should be noted and appropriate action taken to address them.
|-
| Network || 13.7 || Monitor all traffic leaving the organization and detect any unauthorized use of encryption. Attackers often use an encrypted channel to bypass network security devices. Therefore, it is essential that organizations be able to detect rogue connections, terminate the connection, and remediate the infected system.
|-
| Network || 13.8 || Block access to known file transfer and e-mail exfiltration websites.
|-
| Network || 13.9 || Use host-based data loss prevention (DLP) to enforce ACLs even when data is copied off a server.  In most organizations, access to the data is controlled by ACLs that are implemented on the server.  Once the data have been copied to a desktop system, the ACLs are no longer enforced and the users can send the data to whomever they want.

|-
| Application || 14.1 || Segment the network based on the label or classification level of the information stored on the servers. Locate all sensitive information on separated VLANS with firewall filtering to ensure that only authorized individuals are only able to communicate with systems necessary to fulfill their specific responsibilities.
|-
| Application || 14.2 || All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted. Whenever information flows over a network with a lower trust level, the information should be encrypted.
|-
| Application || 14.3 || All network switches will enable Private Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) for segmented workstation networks to limit the ability of devices on a network to directly communicate with other devices on the subnet and limit an attackers ability to laterally move to compromise neighboring systems.
|-
| Application || 14.4 || All information stored on systems shall be protected with file system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principal that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.
|-
| Application || 14.5 || Sensitive information stored on systems shall be encrypted at rest and require a secondary authentication mechanism, not integrated into the operating system, in order to access the information.
|-
| Application || 14.6 || Enforce detailed audit logging for access to nonpublic data and special authentication for sensitive data.
|-
| Application || 14.7 || Archived data sets or systems not regularly accessed by the organization shall be removed from the organization's network. These systems shall only be used as stand alone systems (disconnected from the network) by the business unit needing to occasionally use the system or completely virtualized and powered off until needed.

|-
| Network || 15.1 || Ensure that each wireless device connected to the network matches an authorized configuration and security profile, with a documented owner of the connection and a defined business need. Organizations should deny access to those wireless devices that do not have such a configuration and profile.
|-
| Network || 15.2 || Configure network vulnerability scanning tools to detect wireless access points connected to the wired network. Identified devices should be reconciled against a list of authorized wireless access points. Unauthorized (i.e., rogue) access points should be deactivated.
|-
| Network || 15.3 || Use wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) to identify rogue wireless devices and detect attack attempts and successful compromises. In addition to WIDS, all wireless traffic should be monitored by WIDS as traffic passes into the wired network.
|-
| Network || 15.4 || Where a specific business need for wireless access has been identified, configure wireless access on client machines to allow access only to authorized wireless networks. For devices that do not have an essential wireless business purpose, disable wireless access in the hardware configuration (basic input/output system or extensible firmware interface).
|-
| Network || 15.5 || Ensure that all wireless traffic leverages at least Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption used with at least Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protection.
|-
| Network || 15.6 || Ensure that wireless networks use authentication protocols such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP/TLS), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
|-
| Network || 15.7 || Disable peer-to-peer wireless network capabilities on wireless clients.
|-
| Network || 15.8 || Disable wireless peripheral access of devices (such as Bluetooth), unless such access is required for a documented business need.
|-
| Network || 15.9 || Create separate virtual local area networks (VLANs) for BYOD systems or other untrusted devices. Internet access from this VLAN should go through at least the same border as corporate traffic. Enterprise access from this VLAN should be treated as untrusted and filtered and audited accordingly.

|-
| Application || 16.1 || Review all system accounts and disable any account that cannot be associated with a business process and owner.
|-
| Application || 16.2 || Ensure that all accounts have an expiration date that is monitored and enforced.
|-
| Application || 16.3 || Establish and follow a process for revoking system access by disabling accounts immediately upon termination of an employee or contractor. Disabling instead of deleting accounts allows preservation of audit trails.
|-
| Application || 16.4 || Regularly monitor the use of all accounts, automatically logging off users after a standard period of inactivity.
|-
| Application || 16.5 || Configure screen locks on systems to limit access to unattended workstations.
|-
| Application || 16.6 || Monitor account usage to determine dormant accounts, notifying the user or user’s manager. Disable such accounts if not needed, or document and monitor exceptions (e.g., vendor maintenance accounts needed for system recovery or continuity operations). Require that managers match active employees and contractors with each account belonging to their managed staff. Security or system administrators should then disable accounts that are not assigned to valid workforce members.
|-
| Application || 16.7 || Use and configure account lockouts such that after a set number of failed login attempts the account is locked for a standard period of time.
|-
| Application || 16.8 || Monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging.

| Application || 16.9 || Configure access for all accounts through a centralized point of authentication, for example Active Directory or LDAP.  Configure network and security devices for centralized authentication as well.
|-
| Application || 16.10 || Profile each user’s typical account usage by determining normal time-of-day access and access duration. Reports should be generated that indicate users who have logged in during unusual hours or have exceeded their normal login duration. This includes flagging the use of the user’s credentials from a computer other than computers on which the user generally works.
|-
| Application || 16.11 || Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts that have access to sensitive data or systems. Multi-factor authentication can be achieved using smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, or biometrics.
|-
| Application || 16.12 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters).
|-
| Application || 16.13 || Ensure that all account usernames and authentication credentials are transmitted across networks using encrypted channels.
|-

|-
| Application || 17.2 || Deliver training to fill the skills gap. If possible, use more senior staff to deliver the training. A second option is to have outside teachers provide training onsite so the examples used will be directly relevant. If you have small numbers of people to train, use training conferences or online training to fill the gaps.
|-
| Application || 17.3 || Implement an security awareness program that (1) focuses only on the methods commonly used in intrusions that can be blocked through individual action, (2) is delivered in short online modules convenient for employees (3) is updated frequently (at least annually) to represent the latest attack techniques, (4) is mandated for completion by all employees at least annually, and (5) is reliably monitored for employee completion.
|-
| Application || 17.4 || Validate and improve awareness levels through periodic tests to see whether employees will click on a link from suspicious e-mail or provide sensitive information on the telephone without following appropriate procedures for authenticating a caller; targeted training should be provided to those who fall victim to the exercise.
|-
| Application || 17.5 || Use security skills assessments for each of the mission-critical roles to identify skills gaps. Use hands-on, real-world examples to measure mastery. If you do not have such assessments, use one of the available online competitions that simulate real-world scenarios for each of the identified jobs in order to measure skills mastery.

| Application || 18.1 || For all acquired application software, check that the version you are using is still supported by the vendor. If not, update to the most current version and install all relevant patches and vendor security recommendations.
|-
| Application || 18.2 || Protect web applications by deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) that inspect all traffic flowing to the web application for common web application attacks, including but not limited to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, command injection, and directory traversal attacks. For applications that are not web-based, specific application firewalls should be deployed if such tools are available for the given application type.  If the traffic is encrypted, the device should either sit behind the encryption or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior to analysis.  If neither option is appropriate, a host-based web application firewall should be deployed.
|-
| Application || 18.3 || For in-house developed software, ensure that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. 
|-
| Application || 18.4 || Test in-house-developed and third-party-procured web applications for common security weaknesses using automated remote web application scanners prior to deployment, whenever updates are made to the application, and on a regular recurring basis. In particular, input validation and output encoding routines of application software should be reviewed and tested.
|-
| Application || 18.5 || Do not display system error messages to end-users (output sanitization).
|-
| Application || 18.6 || Maintain separate environments for production and nonproduction systems. Developers should not typically have unmonitored access to production environments.

Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors&amp;mdash;often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation.  Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets.

| Application || 20.6 || Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert.  The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts.
|-
| Application || 20.7 || Wherever possible, ensure that Red Teams results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP).  Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17 |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of life.

However, many favoured [[The eclipse of Darwinism|competing explanations]] and it was not until the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b3847&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=178–179, 338, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the [[life sciences]], explaining the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online&amp;nbsp;– Biography.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html |date=7 January 2007 }} ''darwin-online.org.uk''.

It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world...It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." {{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 1-55111-337-6|page=15 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]]) encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=whowas&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarian]] ideas, and publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made him famous as a popular author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 210, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beddall | first1 = B.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Darwin-Wedgwood family}}
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Desmond|first=Adrian J.|title=Charles Darwin|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=13 September 2002|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title= The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author= John H. Wahlert|date= 11 June 2001|work= Darwin and Darwinism|publisher= [[Baruch College]]|accessdate= 26 November 2008|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/68brqWXRx?url=http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/naturalscience/biology/darwin/|archivedate= 22 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]] and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''née'' Wedgwood). He was the grandson of two prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]: [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side.

[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of seated boy smiling and looking at the viewer. He has straight mid-brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants| Painting of seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816.]]
Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 47–51]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens]]' ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 73–79}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s [[geology]] course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping [[strata]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129, 133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey voyage on HMS ''Beagle''===
{{details|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}
[[File:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao.

Northwest to the Keeling Islands, southwest to Mauritius and Cape Town, then northwest to Bahia and northeast back to Plymouth.|The voyage of the ''Beagle'', 1831–1836]]
After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) [[natural history|naturalist]] for a self-funded [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] place on {{HMS|Beagle}} with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], emphasising that this was a position for a [[gentleman]] rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 105&amp;nbsp;– Henslow, J.

R., 24 Aug 1831|accessdate=29 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116035549/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|archivedate=16 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Darwin]] objected to his son's planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, [[Josiah Wedgwood II]], to agree to (and fund) his son's participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=204–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.&lt;ref name=fnGal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|author2=[[Randal Keynes]]|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=16 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.&lt;ref name=kix /&gt;&lt;ref name=plankton&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=53 21–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in [[Cape Verde]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', which set out [[uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When they reached [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but detested the sight of [[slavery]], and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey continued to the south in [[Patagonia]]. They stopped at [[Bahía Blanca]], and in cliffs near [[Punta Alta]] Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 7]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=138 206–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189–192, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=24 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzBb03?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]], then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at [[Tierra del Fuego]] he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with [[Monogenism|a shared origin]] and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 243–244, 248–250, 382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin experienced [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake in Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, [[island|oceanic islands]] sank, and [[coral reef]]s round them grew to form [[atoll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 160–168, 182}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=278 260]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atolls&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=100 p 98–99]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the geologically new [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.&lt;ref name=k356&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356–357]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.&lt;ref name=Crows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos &amp; Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015611/http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured &amp; pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.&lt;ref name=atolls /&gt; FitzRoy began writing the official ''Narrative'' of the ''Beagle'' voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account.&lt;ref name=Letter301&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-301.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 301&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.R. to Darwin, C.S., 29 Apr 1836|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzmWSB?url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-301|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'' was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cape Town]], Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Islands fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".&lt;ref name=xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix–xx]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 p. 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===
{{details|Inception of Darwin's theory}}

When the ship reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206 /&gt; These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201–205}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207–210}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 346&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and a close friend of the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in [[John Herschel]]'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a [[Physical law|natural cause]] of the origin of new species.&lt;ref name=Rascals /&gt;

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler-finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt &amp; alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Galápagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a [[genealogy|genealogical]] branching of a single [[tree of life (science)|evolutionary tree]], in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] progressing to higher forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=9 7–10]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=44}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=1 1–13, 26, 36, 74]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=229–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overwork, illness, and marriage===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's health}}
While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=21 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new &amp; important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]], which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–234}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 404&amp;nbsp;– Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=23 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629192234/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|archivedate=29 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244, 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of woman aged about 30, with dark hair in centre parting straight on top, then falling in curls on each side. She smiles pleasantly and is wearing an open necked blouse with a large shawl pulled over her arms|Darwin chose to marry his cousin, [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].]]
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=119 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377–378}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=86 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&amp;nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238 232–233]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July.

Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a [[geometric progression]] so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, &amp; adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name="134e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e–135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264–265}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385–388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=39 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''

{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..."&lt;ref name="autobio 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in [[selective breeding]], and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 75 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082830/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 71|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628080656/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|archivedate=28 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called his theory [[natural selection]], an analogy with what he termed the [[artificial selection]] of selective breeding.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Belief: historical essay|accessdate=25 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124103/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/ |archivedate=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1839|elected a Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&amp;pageno=32 p. 32.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' on his theory of [[atoll]] formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=292–293}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1556&amp;pageseq=18 xvi–xvii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=118 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=7 183–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-729.html#back-mark-729.f6|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 729&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320–323, 339–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 1236&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on [[barnacle]]s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].&lt;ref name=barlowbio117&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=121 117–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 he became a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]], gaining postal access to its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|pp=107, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412–441, 457–458, 462–463}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283–284, 290–292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, P. (2011).

His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40–42, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=126 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 374–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 p 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the case for [[common descent]], he included evidence of [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] between humans and other mammals.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2008}}{{Ref label|C|III|none}} Having outlined [[sexual selection]], he hinted that it could explain differences between [[Race (human categorization)|human races]].&lt;ref name=SS_man&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 199]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|1}} He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=506 488]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=199, 488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|2}} His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 p 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of the book he concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508 p 492]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "[[Evolutionism]]" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with [[Prenatal development (biology)|embryological development]], and Darwin first used the word [[evolution]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Freeman|1977|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=80&amp;itemID=A1&amp;viewtype=text 79–80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Matthew]] drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=158, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=17 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615191012/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &amp;#91;supporting&amp;#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487–488, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology]]''.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt; aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.&lt;ref name=B217&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 4652&amp;nbsp;– Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507–508}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128–129, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref label|E|V|none}} and became a key fixture of popular culture.{{Ref label|F|VI|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''On the Origin of Species'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of [[vine|climbing plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiring visitors included [[Ernst Haeckel]], a zealous proponent of ''Darwinismus'' incorporating [[Lamarckism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110511/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Cambridge University Press.

Darwin's book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A1&amp;pageseq=123 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.&lt;ref name=B217 /&gt; With ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[Race (human categorization)|racial classification]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=402 385–405]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359–369}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=145 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system–with all these exalted powers–Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=422 405]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including [[Grant Allen]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 helped transform plant science] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Portrait by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]].]]
By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]] was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in [[Cambridge]] to [[Darwin Day|commemorate his centenary]] and the fiftieth anniversary of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=b222&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222–225}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. [[Ronald Fisher]], an English [[statistics|statistician]], finally united [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419.full The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection An introduction to the book by [[A.

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the [[Beagle Channel]] was named ''[[Darwin Sound]]'' by [[Robert FitzRoy]] after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing [[glacier]] caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=267 216–8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/time_04.html Darwin's Timeline]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend [[John Lort Stokes]] sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain [[John Clements Wickham|Wickham]] named ''[[Port Darwin]]'': a nearby settlement was renamed [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=NTDoPaI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918153343/http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archivedate=18 September 2006|title=Territory origins| accessdate=15 December 2006|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Planning and Infrastructure, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seated statue of Darwin, unveiled 1897, stands in front of [[Shrewsbury Library]], the building that used to house [[Shrewsbury School]], which Darwin attended as a boy. Another statue of Darwin as a young man is situated in the grounds of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]].

[[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], a postgraduate college at [[Cambridge University]], is named after the Darwin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/maps/canterbury/canterbury-campus/building/darwin-college|title=Darwin College – Maps and directions – University of Kent|website=www.kent.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031024930/https://www.kent.ac.uk/maps/canterbury/canterbury-campus/building/darwin-college|archivedate=31 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and [[Anne Darwin|Annie]]'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children.&lt;ref name=whowas /&gt; Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from [[inbreeding]] due to the close family ties he shared with his [[cousin marriage|wife and cousin]], Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=447}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see [[Darwin&amp;nbsp;– Wedgwood family|Darwin-Wedgwood family]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/Children.html Darwin's Children]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and opinions==

===Religious views===
{{Details|Religious views of Charles Darwin}}
[[File:Annie Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Three quarter length studio photo of seated girl about nine years old, looking slightly plump and rather solemn, in a striped dress, holding a basket of flowers on her lap.|In 1851 Darwin was devastated when his daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] died. By then his faith in Christianity had dwindled, and he had stopped going to church.&lt;ref name=jvw41&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=skool /&gt; When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the Bible.&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt; He learned [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=db /&gt; On board HMS ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].&lt;ref name=biorelig&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=87 85–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,&lt;ref name=k356 /&gt; and suggested that the very similar [[antlion]]s found in Australia and England evidence of a divine hand.&lt;ref name=Crows /&gt;

By his return, he was [[Historical criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.&lt;ref name=biorelig /&gt; In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.&lt;ref name=Belief /&gt; The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and ''On the Origin of Species'' reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]]. He was increasingly troubled by the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=4–5, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Darwin and the church: historical essay |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133709/https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |archivedate=28 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.&lt;ref name=jvw41 /&gt; He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107174817/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html |date=7 November 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

The "[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human society===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196–198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colorful description of "[[Fuegian]] savages".&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt; This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin’s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-22442018000100267&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es|language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt;

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a713721865&amp;fulltext=713240928|work=Patterns of Prejudice, Volume 39, Issue 2 |publisher=Routledge |pages=116–137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Vandermassen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |pages=11–13 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012141736/http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was intrigued by his [[Cousin#Additional terms|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556–557, 572, 598}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=180 167–173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=419 402–403]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Galton named this field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}}

==Evolutionary social movements==
[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]
{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilization]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Works==
{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''{{small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], geologist, [[biologist]], and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]], he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for [[biblical literalism]], but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.{{Harv|Browne|1995|pp=186, 414}}

'''{{small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} In the section [[Morphology (biology)|"Morphology"]] of Chapter XIII of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin commented on [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=452&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 434]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=497&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 479]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|1}}{{Note label|D|IV|2}}{{Note label|D|IV|3}}
In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Darwin mentioned [[human evolution|human origins]] in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."&lt;ref name=SS_man /&gt;

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&amp;itemID=F944&amp;viewtype=text vi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''{{small|VI}}.''' {{Note label|F|VI|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''{{small|VII}}.''' {{Note label|G|VII|none}} Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from [[John Edmonstone]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205, 207–208]}}

In the ''Descent of Man'', he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?"{{harv|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=115 102]}}

'''{{small|VIII}}.''' {{Note label|H|VIII|1}}{{Note label|H|VIII|2}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".&lt;br /&gt;({{Cite news | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-supp/text/thurtle.html| title =the creation of genetic identity| last = Thurtle| first =Phillip| date =17 December 1996| issue =Supplement: Cultural and Technological Incubations of Fascism| volume = 5| ref = harv| periodical =SEHR| accessdate =11 November 2008}}{{Cite news| url =http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/154/4/1419#The_Eclipse_of_Darwinism| title =The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

'''[http://www.maritime.org.tw Chinese Maritime Institute]''' also called China Maritime Institute (CMI) was founded on July 11, 1962, and it is a non-profit institute based in the [[Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]]. CMI's main mission is to promote and to engage in academic research on maritime and aviation research and to co-fund the publication of Maritime Quarterly journal in Taiwan. The founding chairman of CMI is the late Professor Kuang Wang. The late Professor Kuang Wang was a leading academic researcher and god father on maritime domain in both China and Taiwan. CMI together with CMRI ([http://www.cmri.org.tw Chinese Maritime Research Institutes])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmri.org.tw cmri.org.tw]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the major maritime research organizations in Taiwan. The permanent president of honour for CMI is Prof. Kuan Lin who is also the founder of one of the largest logistics companies, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003317/http://www.pacificstargroup.com.tw/pacific-en.htm Pacific Star Group], in Taiwan. Dr. Kuan Lin together with his wife, Ms. Ivy Wang, donated a six-storey building, the Ivy Hall, to the [[National Taiwan Ocean University]] in 2011. Current chairman of the CMI is Professor Chih-Ching Chang&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstm.ntou.edu.tw dstm.ntou.edu.tw]&lt;/ref&gt; of the National Taiwan Ocean University. Professor C.C. Chang was also the deputy president of the National Taiwan Ocean University between May 2011 and July 2012. The 17th Board members of CMI will held their posts for three years from May 27, 2011 until May 26, 2014.

CMI has established a late Prof. Kuang Wang Scholarship Commission to support students to study in the six major maritime universities and colleges in Taiwan, including National Taiwan Ocean University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntou.edu.tw]&lt;/ref&gt; National Kaohsiung Marine University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkmu.edu.tw] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222091949/http://www.nkmu.edu.tw/ |date=2012-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; National Penghu University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npu.edu.tw] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207233226/http://npu.edu.tw/ |date=2014-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chang Jung Christian University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjcu.edu.tw]&lt;/ref&gt; [[KaiNan University]], and [[Taipei College of Maritime Technology]].

Readers can find 28 of 57 late Professor Kuang Wang's published books from the China Maritime Institute's website. The official website of Chinese Maritime Institute is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritime.org.tw maritime.org.tw]&lt;/ref&gt; The post address for CMI is 3F., No.10-1, Sec. 2, Ren’ai Rd., Zhongzheng Dist., Taipei City 100, Taiwan (R.O.C.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4868">In [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], '''context''' refers to those objects or entities which surround a ''focal event'', in these disciplines typically a [[communication|communicative]] event, of some kind. Context is "a frame that surrounds the event and provides resources for its appropriate interpretation".&lt;ref name=rethinking&gt;{{cite encyclopedia   |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-last=Goodwin|editor2-last=Duranti |editor2-first=Alessandro |encyclopedia=Rethinking context: Language as an interactive phenomenon |title=Rethinking context: an introduction |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/duranti/reprints/rethco.pdf |access-date=February 19, 2017 |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}} It is thus a relativistic concept, only definable with respect to some focal event, not independently.

== In linguistics ==
'''Verbal context'''  refers to the text or speech surrounding an expression (word, sentence, or [[speech act]]). Verbal context influences the way an expression is understood; hence the norm of not [[Quoting out of context|citing people out of context]]. Since much contemporary linguistics takes texts, discourses, or conversations as the object of analysis, the modern study of verbal context takes place in terms of the analysis of discourse structures and their mutual relationships, for instance the [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] relation between sentences.

Neurolinguistic analysis of context has shown that the interaction between interlocutors defined as parsers creates a reaction in the brain that reflects predictive and interpretative reactions. It can be said then, that mutual knowledge, co-text, genre, speakers, hearers create a neurolinguistic composition of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gcl-N7FZPA4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=what+is+context+linguistics#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20context%20linguistics&amp;f=false|title=What is a Context?: Linguistic Approaches and Challenges|last=Finkbeiner|first=Rita|last2=Meibauer|first2=Jörg|last3=Schumacher|first3=Petra B.|date=2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-9027255792|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, in [[sociolinguistics]], '''social contexts''' were defined in terms of objective social variables, such as those of class, gender, age or race. More recently, social contexts tend to be defined in terms of the social identity being construed and displayed in text and talk by language users. Influenced by space.

The influence of context parameters on language use or discourse is usually studied in terms of ''language variation'', [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] or [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] (see [[Stylistics (linguistics)|Stylistics]]). The basic assumption here is that language users adapt the properties of their language use (such as intonation, lexical choice, syntax, and other aspects of ''formulation'') to the current communicative situation. In this sense, language use or discourse may be called more or less 'appropriate' in a given context. It is the language or derigitave terms surrounding set paragraph, novel or article.

== In linguistic anthropology ==
In the theory of sign phenomena, adapted from [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce|that of Charles Sanders Peirce]], which forms the basis for much contemporary work in [[linguistic anthropology]], the concept of context is integral to the definition of the [[indexicality|index]], one of the three classes of signs comprising Peirce's second trichotomy. An index is a sign which signifies by virtue of "pointing to" some component in its context, or in other words an indexical sign is related to its object by virtue of their co-occurrence within some kind of contextual frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Silverstein |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Silverstein |editor1-last=Auer |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Di Luzio |editor2-first=Aldo |encyclopedia=The Contextualization of Language |title=The Indeterminacy of Contextualization: When Is Enough Enough? |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lhq7IN0IAUAC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22indeterminacy+of+contextualization%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22indeterminacy%20of%20contextualization%22&amp;f=false |access-date=February 19, 2017 |year=1992 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |pages=55–76|isbn=978-9027250346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual variables ==
Communicative systems presuppose contexts that are structured in terms of particular physical and communicative dimensions, for instance time, location, and communicative role.

In [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[geodesy|geodetic]] calculations, '''Cracovians''' are a clerical convenience introduced in the 1930s by [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] for solving systems of [[linear equation]]s by hand. Such systems can be written as ''Ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation where ''x'' and ''b'' are column vectors and the evaluation of ''b'' requires the multiplication of the rows of ''A'' by the vector ''x''.

Cracovians introduced the idea of using the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of ''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, and multiplying the columns of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; by the column ''x''. This amounts to the definition of a new type of [[matrix multiplication]] denoted here by '∧'. Thus ''x'' ∧ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Ax''. The Cracovian product of two matrices, say ''A'' and ''B'', is defined by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A'', where ''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and ''A'' are assumed compatible for the common ([[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]]) type of matrix multiplication.  

Since (''AB'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, the products (''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''B'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''C'' and ''A''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(''B''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''C'') will generally be different; thus, Cracovian multiplication is non-[[associativity|associative]]. Cracovians are an example of a [[quasigroup]].

Cracovians adopted a column-row convention for designating individual elements as opposed to the standard row-column convention of matrix analysis. This made manual multiplication easier, as one needed to follow two parallel columns (instead of a vertical column and a horizontal row in the matrix notation.) It also sped up computer calculations, because both factors' elements were used in a similar order, which was more compatible with the [[sequential access]] memory in computers of those times — mostly [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape memory]] and [[drum memory]]. Use of Cracovians in astronomy faded as computers with bigger [[random access memory]] came into general use. Any modern reference to them is in connection with their non-associative multiplication.

==Programming implementation==
In [[R programming language|R]] the desired effect can be achieved via the &lt;code&gt;crossprod()&lt;/code&gt; function. Specifically, the Cracovian product of matrices ''A'' and ''B'' can be obtained as &lt;code&gt;crossprod(B, A)&lt;/code&gt;.

[[File:France, Paris, la statue de Jeanne d'Arc à la Place des Pyramides.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeanne d'Arc (Frémiet)|Jeanne d'Arc]]'' statue at [[Place des Pyramides]], Paris by [[Emmanuel Frémiet]], 1874]]
[[Joan of Arc]] ([[Jeanne d'Arc]] in French) has inspired artistic and cultural works for nearly six centuries.  The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture.  The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog.  Lesser known works, particularly from early periods, are not included.
In this article, many of the excluded items are derivative of better known representations.  For instance, [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] play inspired at least 82 different dramatic works during the nineteenth century, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] operatic adaptations are still recorded and performed.  Most of the others survive only in research libraries.{{Ref|adaptations}}  As another example, in 1894, Émile Huet listed over 400 plays and musical works about Joan of Arc.  Despite a great deal of scholarly interest in Joan of Arc no complete list of artistic works about her exists, although a 1989 doctoral dissertation did identify all relevant films including ones for which [[Lost film|no copy survives]].{{Ref|lists}}

Portrayals of Joan of Arc are numerous.  For example, in 1979 the ''Bibliothèque Municipale'' in [[Rouen]], France displayed a gallery containing over 500 images and other items related to Joan of Arc.{{Ref|Rouen}}
The story of Joan of Arc was a popular subject for dramatization in the 1940s. &lt;!-- (Perhaps this was due to World War II and the appeal of the subject of driving invaders from one's country.)--&gt; In addition to Maxwell Anderson's play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'' and the [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'', there was also the 1948 RKO film ''[[The Miracle of the Bells]]'' starring [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Alida Valli]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], about a dying film actress whose first and last role is Joan of Arc. There were also three radio dramatizations of the story of Joan during those years, one of them specifically written with a World War II framework.

==Organization of this article==
For purposes of classification, popular culture music is a separate section from [[opera]]s and [[oratorio]]s. [[Film]]s include made-for-television movies and [[miniseries]].  Television covers live action series.

|''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc''
|[[Thérèse of Lisieux]]
|The first of two 'pious recreations' written by the Saint; "small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days." Performed at the Carmel on January 21, 1894, it featured Thérèse in the title role. The script, which focuses more heavily upon Joan's interaction with her visions, has since been widely circulated with Saint Thérèse's writings, as has that of its sequel.

|Sequel to ''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc'', this was performed exactly one year later, January 21, 1895. Again featuring Thérèse as Joan, its focus is upon her martyrdom. In the estimation of Thérèse's biographer, Ida Görres, the two plays "are scarcely veiled self-portraits."

She is dressed in grey, with high hose, an attire of a man. Thence to think that it has to do with the departure from Vaucouleurs or arrival at Chinon, there is not but to take a step; to prove it is another thing.

| "helmeted head of a statue"
|
| ''Musée Historique et Archeologique'', Orléans
| The head of a statue, discovered in 1820 in the ruins of the Church of Saint-Maurice, Orléans, long considered to have been modelled after the likeness of Joan of Arc.&lt;ref&gt;

Edmunds (2008:[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9maU4D-QLUC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 40f.]) portrays the possibility of the head representing Jeanne d'Arc as plausible, citing enthusiastic support from [[Walter Scott]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and claims a "a tradition than when Joan entered Orléans in triumph after the siege was raised a sculptor modelled the head of his statue of St Maurice from Joan herself".
The head was discovered in the ruins of the demolished church in 1820, and the "tradition" is in fact limited to learned 19th-century speculation. 20th-century art historians tend to identify the head as belonging to a statue of [[Saint George]]. "Tête casquée découverte en 1820 dans les démolitions des restes de l'ancienne église Saint-Eloi-Saint-Maurice, considérée parfois, mais à tort, comme représentant Jeanne d'Arc; c'est en réalité une tête de St Georges."

However, when Homer gets to the part where she was burned at the stake, Lisa says, "Was she killed?" and Marge runs in and says, "Just then, [[Sir Lancelot]] rode up on his white horse and saved Joan of Arc! They got married and lived in a spaceship!" She then tore the page out, ate it, and says, "Easier to chew than that ''[[Bambi]]'' video!"

Joan of Arc's short haircut had a profound effect on women's hairstyles in the twentieth century.  In 1909, the Paris hairdresser Antoine took Joan of Arc as the inspiration for the [[Bob cut|bob]], which ended centuries of taboo against women who cut their hair.  The style became popular in the 1920s and was associated with [[Sexual liberation|liberated women]].  Nearly all subsequent Western hair fashions are designed for women who cut their hair at least occasionally. Such haircut is still known in French as ''coupe à la Jeanne d'Arc'' (Joan of Arc's haircut).

During the [[Cristero War]] in 1927, a group of female Cristeros named themselves after Joan of Arc.  They obtained money, supplies, and intelligence for the male combatants.  They often smuggled weapons into war zones and cared for the wounded.  By the end of the war they had 35,000 participants.

Several people have been seen as modern versions of Joan of Arc:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">In [[microbiology]], '''D-value''' refers to '''decimal reduction time''' (or decimal reduction dose) and is the time (or dose) required at a given condition (e.g. temperature), or set of conditions, to kill 90% (or 1 log) of the exposed [[microorganisms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/iceci/inspections/inspectionguides/ucm070835.htm|title=Inspection Guides - Sterilizing Symbols (D, Z, F)|last=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|first=|date=|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term originated from assessing microbial thermal resistance and [[thermal death time]] analysis; however, it has analogous uses in other microbial resistance and death rate applications, such as (but not limited to) those of [[ethylene oxide]] and [[radiation]] processing.

Thus after a colony is reduced by 1 D, only 10% of the original organisms remain, i.e., the population number has been reduced by one decimal place in the counting scheme. Generally, each lot of a [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]-resistant organism is given a unique D-value.  When referring to D-values, for the purpose of thermal analysis, it is proper to give the temperature as a subscript of the "D". For example, given a hypothetical organism which is reduced by 90% after exposure to temperatures of 150°&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|C]] for 20 minutes, the D-value would be written as D&lt;sub&gt;150C&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;20 minutes. If generally describing D-value for any temperature, a common abbreviation is D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (where T is temperature) until a value for T is relevant to express, specifically. Another more general abbreviated expression of D-value is D&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (as to denote 10% reduction).

D-value determination is sometimes carried out to measure a [[disinfectant]]'s efficiency to reduce the number of microbes present in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/24 |title=Determination of decimal reduction time (D value) of chemical agents used in hospitals for disinfection purposes |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases  |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-3-24 |author=Priscila Gava Mazzola, Thereza Christina Vessoni Penna, Alzira M da S Martins |volume=3 |pages=24 |date=17 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''embryo''' is an early stage of [[embryogenesis|development]] of a [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[ploidy|diploid]] [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organism. In general, in [[organism]]s that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], an embryo develops from a [[zygote]], the single cell resulting from the [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of the female [[egg cell]] by the male [[sperm]] cell. The zygote possesses half the [[DNA]] from each of its two parents. In [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and some [[protist]]s, the zygote will begin to divide by [[mitosis]] to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo.

In [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], a [[prenatal development|developing fetus]] is considered as an embryo until the ninth week, [[Human fertilization#Fertilization age|fertilization age]], or eleventh-week [[gestational age]]. After this time the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=embryo|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302|website=Mayo|accessdate=21 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220102352/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302|archivedate=20 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the mid-14c., the word ''embryon'' derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''embryo'', itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυον}} (''embruon''), lit. "young one",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruon ἔμβρυον] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531161449/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruon |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the neuter of {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυος}} (''embruos''), lit. "growing in",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruos ἔμβρυος] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531041203/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruos |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from ἐν (''en''), "in"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29n ἐν] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531101258/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29n |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and βρύω (''bruō''), "swell, be full";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbru%2Fw βρύω] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531101318/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbru%2Fw |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; the proper [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of the Greek term would be ''embryum''.

==Development==

[[File:Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s.ogv|thumb|Embryonic development of salamander, circa the 1920s]]
[[File:Wrinkledfrog embryos.jpg|thumb|Embryos (and one [[tadpole]]) of the wrinkled frog (''Rana rugosa'')]]
In animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of [[blastula]], [[gastrulation|gastrula]], and [[organogenesis]]. The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity, the [[Coelom|blastocoel]], surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells, also called [[blastomere]]s. In a [[eutheria|placental mammal]], an ovum is fertilized in a [[fallopian tube]] through which it travels into the uterus. An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until [[childbirth|birth]] or hatching. In humans, this is from the eleventh week of [[gestation]]. However, animals which develop in eggs outside the mother's body, are usually referred to as embryos throughout development; e.g. one would refer to a [[bird|chick]] embryo, not a "chick fetus", even at later stages.

During [[gastrulation]] the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division, invasion, and/or migration to form two ([[diploblasty|diploblastic]]) or three ([[triploblasty|triploblastic]]) tissue layers. In triploblastic organisms, the three [[germ layer]]s are called [[endoderm]], [[ectoderm]], and [[mesoderm]]. The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific, however, depending on the type of embryo produced. In [[vertebrate]]s, a special population of embryonic cells called the [[neural crest]] has been proposed as a "fourth germ layer", and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures.

During organogenesis, molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers, combined with the cells' developmental potential, or [[competence (biology)|competence]] to respond, prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} For example, in [[neurogenesis]], a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]. Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis, including [[angiogenesis]] (formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones), [[chondrogenesis]] (cartilage), [[myogenesis]] (muscle), [[Osteoblast|osteogenesis]] (bone), and many others.

[[File:Ginkgo embryo and gametophyte.jpg|thumb|The inside of a ''[[Ginkgo]]'' seed, showing the embryo]]
In [[botany]], a [[Spermatophyte|seed plant]] ''embryo'' is part of a [[seed]], consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves, stem (see '''[[hypocotyl]]'''), and root (see '''[[radicle]]'''), as well as one or more '''[[cotyledon]]s'''. Once the embryo begins to [[germination|germinate]]—grow out from the seed—it is called a '''seedling''' (plantlet).

[[Bryophyte]]s and [[fern]]s also produce an embryo, but do not produce seeds. In these plants, the embryo begins its existence attached to the inside of the [[archegonium]] on a parental [[gametophyte]] from which the egg cell was generated. The inner wall of the archegonium lies in close contact with the "foot" of the developing embryo; this "foot" consists of a bulbous mass of cells at the base of the embryo which may receive nutrition from its parent gametophyte. The structure and development of the rest of the embryo varies by group of plants. Once the embryo has expanded beyond the enclosing archegonium, it is no longer termed an embryo.

==Research and technology==
Embryos are used in various fields of research and in techniques of [[assisted reproductive technology]]. An egg may be fertilized in vitro and the resulting embryo may be [[Cryopreservation#Embryos|frozen]] for later use.
The potential of embryonic [[stem cell]] research, reproductive [[cloning]], and [[germline engineering]] are currently being explored. [[Prenatal testing|Prenatal diagnosis]] or [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|preimplantation diagnosis]] enables testing embryos for diseases or conditions.

[[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] is a practice in which animal germplasms, such as embryos are collected and stored at low temperatures with the intent of conserving the genetic material.

The embryos of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' have been used as a model to understand gene activation, patterning, and organogenesis of seed plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boscá | first1=S | last2=Knauer | first2=S | last3=Laux | first3=T | year=2011 | title=Embryonic development in Arabidopsis thaliana: from the zygote division to the shoot meristem | journal=Frontiers in Plant Science | doi=10.3389/fpls.2011.00093 | PMID=22639618 | pmc=3355580 | volume=2 | pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to research using human embryos, the ethics and legalities of this application continue to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Jeri. "America Debates Stem Cell Research."

Researchers from MERLN Institute and the [[Hubrecht Institute]] in the Netherlands managed to grow samples of synthetic rodent embryos, combining certain types of [[stem cells]]. This method will help scientists to more deeply study the very first moments of the process of the birth of a new life, which, in turn, can lead to the emergence of new effective methods to combat [[infertility]] and other [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/model-mouse-embryos-grown-stem-cells/54484/ "Scientists grow synthetic mouse embryos from stem cells"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508185235/https://newatlas.com/model-mouse-embryos-grown-stem-cells/54484/ |date=2018-05-08 }} New Atlas, May 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossilized embryos===

{{Main|Fossil embryos}}
Fossilized animal embryos are known from the [[Precambrian]], and are found in great numbers during the [[Cambrian]] period. Even fossilized [[dinosaur]] embryos have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22085535 | title=Dinosaur embryo fossils reveal life inside the egg | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Morelle, Rebecca | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924135744/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22085535 | archivedate=24 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscarriage and abortion==
{{see also|Miscarriage|Abortion}}
[[File:Human Embryo - Approximately 8 weeks estimated gestational age.jpg|right|thumb|A complete spontaneous abortion at about 6 weeks from [[fertilisation|conception]], i.e. 8 weeks from [[gestational age|LMP]]]]
Some embryos do not survive to the next stage of development. When this happens naturally, it is called spontaneous abortion or miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;miscarriage {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/miscarriage |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512132007/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/miscarriage |archivedate=2016-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons why this may occur. The most common natural cause of miscarriage is chromosomal abnormality in animals&lt;ref name="mednet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage/page1.htm |title=Miscarriage (Spontaneous Abortion) |accessdate=2009-04-07 |last=Conrad Stöppler |first=Melissa |editor-first=William C. |editor-last=Shiel Jr. |work=MedicineNet.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829013142/http://www.medicinenet.com/Miscarriage/page1.htm |archivedate=2004-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or genetic load in plants.&lt;ref name="Kärkkäinen"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Katri | last1=Kärkkäinen | first2=Outi |last2=Savolainen | first3=Veikko | last3=Koski | year=1999 | title=Why do plants abort so many developing seeds: bad offspring or bad maternal genotypes? | journal=Evolutionary Ecology | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=305–317 | doi=10.1023/A:1006746900736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In species which produce multiple embryos at the same time, miscarriage or abortion of some embryos can provide the remaining embryos with a greater share of maternal resources. This can also disturb the pregnancy, causing harm to the second embryo. Genetic strains which miscarry their embryos are the source of commercial seedless fruits.

Abortion is the process of artificially (non-naturally) removing the embryo through deliberate pharmaceutical or surgical methods.

'''Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]]''' (FRAP) is a method for determining the kinetics of diffusion through tissue or cells. It is capable of quantifying the two dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of [[cell membrane]] diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing [[phospholipid]] bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.

Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional [[diffusion]] and [[binding (molecular)|binding]] of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.

==Experimental Setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an [[optical microscope]], a [[List of light sources|light source]] and some [[fluorescent]] probe. [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent emission]] is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad [[spectrum]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[xenon]] source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with [[laser]] light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the [[diffusion equation]]. Assuming a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant ''D'' can be simply calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{w^{2}}{4t_{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the radius of the beam and ''t&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "Characteristic" diffusion time.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(76)85755-4 |journal=Biophysical Journal |title=Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery kinetics |date=1976 |last1=Axelrod |first1=D |last2=Koppel |first2=D |last3=Schlessinger |first3=J |last4=Elson |first4=E |last5=Webb |first5=W |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1055–69 |pmid=786399 |pmc=1334945|bibcode=1976BpJ....16.1055A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sprague1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1529/biophysj.103.026765 |title=Analysis of Binding Reactions by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching |date=2004 |last1=Sprague |first1=Brian L. |last2=Pego |first2=Robert L. |last3=Stavreva |first3=Diana A. |last4=McNally |first4=James G. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=3473–95 |pmid=15189848 |pmc=1304253|bibcode=2004BpJ....86.3473S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Supported Lipid Bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP  technique was intended for use as a means to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Axelrod" /&gt; While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating [[membrane proteins]], these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein Binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) [[fusion protein]]s, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP.  When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Chunmin Dong |author3=Guangyu Wu |author4=Nevin A Lambert |date=August 2011      | title = Inactive-state preassembly of Gq-coupled receptors and Gq heterotrimers| journal = Nature Chemical Biology  | volume =  7 | issue = 11  | pages =740–747  | doi=10.1038/nchembio.642 | pmid=21873996 | pmc=3177959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked.  Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23042527 |date=2012|last1=Day|first1=CA |last2=Kraft|first2=LJ |last3=Kang|first3=M|last4=Kenworthy|first4=AK|title=Analysis of protein and lipid dynamics using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)|pages=2–19|journal=Current Protocols in Cytometry|doi=10.1002/0471142956.cy0219s62 |volume=Chapter 2 |pmc=3538152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If after some time the fluorescence doesn't reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion).  Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding.  This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23900248 |date=2013|last1=Mazza|first1=D|last2=Mueller|first2=F|last3=Stasevich|first3=TJ|last4=McNally|first4=JG|title=Convergence of chromatin binding estimates in live cells|pages=691–2|volume=10|issue=8|journal=Nat Methods|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" pmid=18434433"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Pooja R.

==Applications Outside the Membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane.  After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a [[confocal microscope]] is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the [[cytoplasm]],&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt; [[mitotic spindle]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or another cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19005234 |date=2008 |last1=Tripathi |first1=K |last2=Parnaik |first2=VK |title=Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=345–54 |journal=Journal of Biosciences |doi=10.1007/s12038-008-0054-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients, such as those for the protein's binding reactions and/or the protein's diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16080269 |date=2005 |last1=Houtsmuller |first1=AB |title=Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching: Application to nuclear proteins |volume=95 |pages=177–99 |journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology |doi=10.1007/b102214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only dynamics considered are diffusion and binding/unbinding interactions, however, in principle proteins can also move via flow, i.e., undergo directed motion, and this was recognized very early by Axelrod et al.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"/&gt; This could be due to flow of the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, or transport along filaments in the cell such as [[microtubules]] by [[molecular motors]].

The analysis is most simple when the fluorescence recovery is limited by either the rate of diffusion into the bleached area or by rate at which bleached proteins unbind from their binding sites within the bleached area, and are replaced by fluorescent protein. Let us look at these two limits, for the common case of bleaching a GFP fusion protein in a living cell.

===Diffusion-limited fluorescence recovery===
For a circular bleach spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by an equation derived by Soumpasis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(83)84410-5 |title=Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments |date=1983 |last1=Soumpasis |first1=D |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=41 |pages=95–7 |pmid=6824758 |issue=1 |pmc=1329018|bibcode=1983BpJ....41...95S }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which involves [[modified Bessel function]]s &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=e^{-2\tau_D/t}\left(I_{0}(2\tau_D/t)+I_{1}(2\tau_D/t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic timescale for diffusion, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time. &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity). The diffusion timescale for a bleached spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tau_D=w^2/(4D)&lt;/math&gt;, with ''D'' the diffusion coefficient.

Note that this is for an instantaneous bleach with a step function profile, i.e., the fraction &lt;math&gt;f_b&lt;/math&gt; of protein assumed to be bleached instantaneously at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=b, ~~r&lt;w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=0, ~~r&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the distance from the centre of the bleached area. It is also assumes that the recovery can be modelled by diffusion in two dimensions, that is also both uniform and isotropic. In other words, that diffusion is occurring in a uniform medium so the effective diffusion constant ''D'' is the same everywhere, and that the diffusion is isotropic, i.e., occurs at the same rate along all axes in the plane.

In practice, in a cell none of these assumptions will be strictly true.

#Bleaching will not be instantaneous. Particularly if strong bleaching of a large area is required, bleaching may take a significant fraction of the diffusion timescale &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Then a significant fraction of the bleached protein will diffuse out of the bleached region actually during bleaching.

#The bleached profile will not be a radial step function. If the bleached spot is effectively a single pixel then the bleaching as a function of position will typically be diffraction limited and determined by the optics of the [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] used. This is not a radial step function and also varies along the axis perpendicular to the plane.
#Cells are of course three-dimensional not two-dimensional, as is the bleached volume. Neglecting diffusion out of the plane (we take this to be the ''xy'' plane) will be a reasonable approximation only if the fluorescence recovers predominantly via diffusion in this plane. This will be true, for example, if a cylindrical volume is bleached with the axis of the cylinder along the ''z'' axis and with this cylindrical volume going through the entire height of the cell. Then diffusion along the ''z'' axis does not cause fluorescence recovery as all protein is bleached uniformly along the ''z'' axis, and so neglecting it, as Soumpasis' equation does, is harmless. However, if diffusion along the ''z'' axis does contribute to fluorescence recovery then it must be accounted for.
#There is no reason to expect the cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to be completely spatially uniform or isotropic.

Thus, the equation of Soumpasis is just a useful approximation, that can be used when the assumptions listed above are good approximations to the true situation, and when the recovery of fluorescence is indeed limited by the timescale of diffusion &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Note that just because the Soumpasis can be fitted adequately to data does not necessarily imply that the assumptions are true and that diffusion dominates recovery.

===Reaction-limited recovery===
The equation describing the fluorescence as a function of time is particularly simple in another limit. If a large number of proteins bind to sites in a small volume such that there the fluorescence signal is dominated by the signal from bound proteins, and if this binding is all in a single state with an off rate k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;, then the fluorescence as a function of time is given by&lt;ref name = "bulinski01"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11719555 |date=2001 |last1=Bulinski |first1=JC |last2=Odde |first2=DJ |last3=Howell |first3=BJ |last4=Salmon |first4=TD |last5=Waterman-Storer |first5=CM |title=Rapid dynamics of the microtubule binding of ensconsin in vivo |volume=114 |issue=Pt 21 |pages=3885–97 |journal=Journal of Cell Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=1-e^{-k_{\text{off}}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the recovery depends on the rate constant for unbinding, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', only. It does not depend on the on rate for binding. Although it does depend on a number of assumptions&lt;ref name ="bulinski01" /&gt;
#The on rate must be sufficiently large in order for the local concentration of bound protein to greatly exceed the local concentration of free protein, and so allow us to neglect the contribution to ''f'' of the free protein.
#The reaction is a simple bimolecular reaction, where the protein binds to localised sites that do not move significantly during recovery
#Exchange is much slower than diffusion (or whatever transport mechanism is responsible for mobility), as only then does the diffusing fraction recovery rapidly and then acts as the source of fluorescent protein that binds and replaces the bound bleached protein and so increases the fluorescence. With '' r '' the radius of the bleached spot, this means that the equation is only valid if the bound lifetime &lt;math&gt;1/k_{\text{off}} &gt;&gt; r^2/D&lt;/math&gt;.
If all these assumptions are satisfied, then fitting an exponential to the recovery curve will give the off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, other dynamics can give recovery curves similar to exponentials, so fitting an exponential does not necessarily imply that recovery is dominated by a simple bimolecular reaction. One way to distinguish between recovery with a rate determined by unbinding  and recovery that is limited by diffusion, is to note that the recovery rate for unbinding-limited recovery is independent of the size of the bleached area ''r'', while it scales as &lt;math&gt;r^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, for diffusion-limited recovery. Thus if a small and a large area are bleached, if recovery is limited by unbinding then the recovery rates will be the same for the two sizes of bleached area, whereas if recovery is limited by diffusion then it will be much slower for the larger bleached area.

===Diffusion and reaction===

In general, the recovery of fluorescence will not be dominated by either simple isotropic diffusion, or by a single simple unbinding rate. There will be both diffusion and binding, and indeed the diffusion constant may not be uniform in space, and there may be more than one type of binding sites, and these sites may also have a non-uniform distribution in space. Flow processes may also be important. This more complex behavior implies that a model with several parameters is required to describe the data; models with only either a single diffusion constant ''D'' or a single off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', are inadequate.

There are models with both diffusion and reaction.&lt;ref name="sprague1"/&gt; Unfortunately, a single FRAP curve may provide insufficient evidence to reliably and uniquely fit (possibly noisy) experimental data. Sadegh Zadeh '' et al.'' &lt;ref name="zadeh06"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1742-4682-3-36 |date=2006 |last1=Sadegh Zadeh |first1=Kouroush |last2=Montas |first2=Hubert J |last3=Shirmohammadi |first3=Adel |journal=Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling |volume=3 |pages=36 |pmid=17034642 |title=Identification of biomolecule mass transport and binding rate parameters in living cells by inverse modeling |pmc=1635038}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that FRAP curves can be fitted by ''different'' pairs of values of the diffusion constant and the on-rate constant, or, in other words, that fits to the FRAP are not unique. This is in three-parameter (on-rate constant, off-rate constant and diffusion constant) fits. Fits that are not unique, are not generally useful.

Thus for models with a number of parameters, a single FRAP experiment may be insufficient to estimate all the model parameters. Then more data is required, e.g., by bleaching areas of different sizes,&lt;ref name="gonzalez11"/&gt; determining some model parameters independently, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">'''Focal Plane Arrays''' (FPAs) are arrays of [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] placed at the [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of the optical system in a [[radio-telescope]]. The optical system may be a [[Reflecting telescope|reflector]] or a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. Traditional radio-telescopes have only one receiver at the focus of the telescope, but radio-telescopes are now starting to be equipped with focal plane arrays, which are of three different types: multi-beam feed arrays, bolometer arrays, and the experimental phased-array feeds.

==Multi-beam feed arrays==
Multi-beam feed arrays consist of a small array of [[feed horn]]s at the [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[radio-telescope]]. Each feed horn is connected to a receiver to measure the received power and each horn and receiver pair is sensitive to radio waves from a slightly different direction in the sky. A feed array with {{mvar|n}} receivers will increase the survey speed of the telescope by a factor of {{mvar|n}}, making them very powerful survey instruments. Because radio wavelengths are large, the resulting feed arrays are amongst the largest radio-astronomy receivers ever built. Examples include the multi-beam arrays on the [[Parkes Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/multibeam/ Parkes 21 cm Multibeam Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |title=The Parkes methanol multibeam survey |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |volume=2 |issue=S237 |page=403 |conference=IAU Symposium #237:  Star Formation in a Turbulent ISM |location=Prague |date=15 August 2006 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=973788 |conference-url=http://astro.cas.cz/iaus237/ |doi=10.1017/S1743921307001913 |bibcode=2007IAUS..237..403C |first1=R.J. |last1=Cohen |first2=J.L. |last2=Caswell |first3=K. |last3=Brooks |first4=M.G. |last4=Burton |first5=A. |last5=Chrysostomou |first6=J. |last6=Cox |first7=P.J. |last7=Diamond |first8=S. |last8=Ellingsen |first9=G.A. |last9=Fuller |first10=M.D. |last10=Gray |first11=J.A. |last11=Green |first12=M.G. |last12=Hoare |first13=M.R.W. |last13=Masheder |first14=N. |last14=McClure-Griffiths |first15=M. |last15=Pestalozzi |first16=C. |last16=Phillips |first17=M. |last17=Thompson |first18=M. |last18=Voronkov |first19=A. |last19=Walsh |first20=D. |last20=Ward-Thompson |first21=D. |last21=Wong-McSweeney |first22=J.A. |last22=Yates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ALFA array at [[Arecibo Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naic.edu/alfa/ ALFA]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have been used for major [[pulsar]] and [[Hydrogen line]] studies, such as [[HIPASS]].

==Bolometer Arrays==
Bolometer arrays are arrays of [[bolometer]] receivers which measure the energy of incoming radio photons. They are typically used for [[astronomy]] at millimeter wavelengths. Examples include the [[Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array|SCUBA]] receiver on the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] and the LABOCA
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/staff/gsiringo/laboca/laboca_at_the_mpifr_bolometer_group.html LABOCA]&lt;/ref&gt;
instrument on the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment|APEX]] telescope.

==Phased Array Feeds==
Phased Array Feeds are an experimental type of focal plane array using [[phased array]] technology in which antenna elements are closely spaced so that they do not act independently, but instead act as sensors of the electromagnetic field across the focal plane of the telescope. The outputs of the receivers are then coherently combined in a [[beamformer]] with appropriate weights to synthesise several discrete beams. They are currently being developed for the Apertif
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astron.nl/general/apertif/apertif Apertif ]&lt;/ref&gt;
upgrade to the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]], and for the [[Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder]] radio telescope.

==Switched Array Feeds==
A switchable array of feed antennas in the focal plane is referred to as a switchable FPA. With this configuration, it is possible to switch between a set of beams directed in different directions. This makes the system steerable in the switching sense, thus creating a multi-beam system. In a switched FPA, the distance between feeding elements are chosen following &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frid |first1=Henrik |title=
Closed-Form Relation Between the Scan Angle and Feed Position for Extended Hemispherical Lenses Based on Ray Tracing |journal=IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta d = F \lambda/D, &lt;/math&gt; 
where F is the focal length of the optical system, D is the diameter of the optical system and λ is the wavelength.

==Monopulse feeds==
The angle to the observed target (e.g. a meteor in meteor studies) can be estimated using [[amplitude monopulse]]. In such a configuration, three signals are collected from four feed elements. These signals are the elevation difference signal, the azimuth difference signal and the sum signal.

'''Franklin University Switzerland''' is a [[Private school|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts university]] in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded in 1969, Franklin offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees accredited by both in Switzerland and in the United States. Prospective American students can apply to Franklin University Switzerland through the [[Common Application]].

==History==
Chartered in 1969, Franklin University Switzerland was born out of the former Fleming College and founded as a non-profit, independent, post-secondary institution under the name of Franklin University Switzerland. The institution is named for [[Benjamin Franklin]], the [[United States]]' first ambassador to [[France]]. It has stressed, since its incarnation, the importance of international studies as the basis for a strong, global education.

Franklin University Switzerland obtained United States accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1975, confirmed most recently in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=232|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|author=Info724 Ltd.|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having obtained Swiss program-level accreditation in 2005, Franklin was granted full university institution accreditation by the Swiss University Conference in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cus.ch/wDeutsch/akkreditierung/studiengaenge/index.php|title=Schweizerische Universitätskonferenz - Akkreditierte Studiengänge und Institutionen|author=author|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the only university in the world to be accredited in the United States and Switzerland. Swiss accreditation as a university institution gave Franklin the right to call itself a university in Switzerland. In April 2014, the institution officially changed its name and celebrated its inauguration as Franklin University Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|title=Franklin Celebrates University Day|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120222658/http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Franklin College Switzerland Main Lawn 2007.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, the main campus]]
The main campus (known as Kaletsch Campus), acquired in 1985, is composed of a private villa with attached library, auditorium, and classroom wing, surrounded by a wooded park. In 2005 the university acquired an additional campus nearby (known as North Campus), adding administrative, education, athletic, social and residential capacity. The current campus spans {{convert|5|acre|ha|order=flip|0}}. The Franklin campus is residential, and is on a hillside overlooking the town of [[Lugano]], in the Italian-speaking canton of [[Ticino]], [[Switzerland]].

[[Image:Franklin College Residenza Panera.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, Residenza Panera]]

Franklin University Switzerland has nine residence buildings, seven in [[Sorengo]] and two in [[Lugano]].
* Airone is in an old hotel directly between the main campus and North Campus with singles and doubles. All rooms have their own bathrooms and some of which have kitchenettes. The ground floor houses the office of Student Life, and one of the student lounges, the "Falcon's Nest".
* Alba is in Lugano 5–10 minutes from North Campus on the way downtown.
* Ciliegi is directly across via Ponte Tresa from Airone. This is the smallest residence on campus, in apartment-style doubles.
* Leonardo da Vinci (LDV) is on the grounds of North Campus; this is the only all-freshman student dormitory.
* Giardino, nestled below the Sorengo monastery: This residence is mainly multiples (4-6 bedrooms and a shared kitchen) with some triples for freshmen.
* Panera is on the main campus grounds next to the Grotto (one of two dining halls) with apartment-style triples. Each apartment consists of four rooms: a bedroom, bathroom (with bathtub), separate kitchen, and a large common room with three desks and a couch. The Panera Lawn is a common meeting place and hang out for many students, no matter what residence they live in.
* The final two buildings are the as-of-late unnamed New Buildings (A and B) located across via Ponte Tresa from Panera. New Building A has four bedroom apartment-style housing, while New Building B has two, three, four, five, and six bedroom apartments, some of which are two stories. All rooms in both New Buildings have arguably the biggest kitchens on campus with at least one bathroom (with a shower) per two students. New Building B offers a noise-free, substance-free rooming option with an emphasis on healthy living for students.

==Academics==
Franklin's curriculum promotes international awareness and critical thinking, and emphasizes an interdisciplinary and liberal arts perspective. The majority of courses are taught in English, with the exception of language courses, including an upper-level language courses on film, culture and literature. Students must achieve proficiency in Italian, French, Spanish, or German, through fulfilling a three-year language course sequence.

In addition to the language requirement, a core curriculum consisting of Intercultural Competencies (humanities and arts), International Engagement (political science, history and economics) and Social Responsibility (sciences and cultural studies) is at the forefront. A full year's worth of study in these three categories is a requirement. Courses in mathematics and writing are required as well.

The most popular majors at Franklin are International Management, International Relations, Environmental Studies, Communications and Media Studies and International Economics, respectively.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/franklin-college-switzerland-CH0001|title=Franklin University Switzerland|work=Best Colleges|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average class size at Franklin is 16, with no class exceeding 30 students.

==Academic Travel Program==
The Academic Travel Program is an integrated part of the Franklin University Switzerland curriculum. Academic Travel is a credit-bearing degree requirement, and two weeks of travel each semester represent an extension of the students’ class work.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goabroad.com/providers/franklin-college-switzerland/programs/franklin-a-us-college-in-switzerland-4605|title=Franklin - A US College in Switzerland|work=Degree Abroad|publisher=GoAbroad|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel is led by faculty members and relates to the academic expertise of the individual professor and to his or her knowledge of a given country or area.

All students, including semester and year-abroad students, are required to participate in the Academic Travel Program. Academic Travel is a graduation requirement and an integral component of each semester of study. The graduation requirement for Academic Travel is fulfilled by participating in six travel programs. Students usually fulfill the requirement by participating each semester of their first three years at Franklin. Students who enter with sophomore standing must participate each semester in which they are enrolled except their senior year.

The travels are themed around academic studies relating to the location visited and the professor guiding the travel. Economics, art history, literature, business and marketing, international relations, and history are among common themes investigated through travels.

Academic Travel destinations have included the [[Baltic states]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Mozambique]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Scotland]], [[Serbia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]].

==Student life==
Student life at Franklin consists of an emphasis on independent travel in [[Switzerland]] and greater [[Europe]], and of student associations, residential life, and interaction with Swiss-Italian culture in Lugano.

==Athletics==
Franklin University Switzerland offers students a wide variety of sports and fitness programs, as well as activities to promote a healthy lifestyle. Some on-campus sports facilities include the Tone Athletic Center, two volleyball courts, a basketball court and a soccer field.  Organized athletic activities include Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Basketball, and Lugano Street Dance. Students are also encouraged to start athletic programs. Student-led activities have included Field Hockey, Yoga, Cross-fit, and Self-Defense.

Since 2000-2001 (with an exception of a bye year in 2001-2002)  Franklin's men's soccer team has competed in the National Swiss Division (5th League). The team competes with other clubs in the league from the Canton of [[Ticino]]. Franklin University Switzerland is currently the reserve team for the local club FC Paradiso, making it Franklin FC Paradiso II. In spring 2012 the team won its fourth Fair Play award. The team trains twice a week and competes on the weekends in the fall and spring semesters — home games are played on Friday nights. The players have a mid-season break from December to February.  During this period the school hosts an indoor soccer tournament open to all Franklin students, faculty and staff.

'''G-force induced loss of consciousness''' (abbreviated as '''G-LOC''', pronounced 'JEE-lock') is a term generally used in [[aerospace physiology]] to describe a [[Syncope (medicine)|loss of consciousness]] occurring from excessive and sustained [[g-force]]s draining blood away from the brain causing cerebral [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  The condition is most likely to affect [[aviator|pilots]] of high performance [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] aircraft or [[astronaut]]s but is possible on some [[g-force#Human g-force experience|extreme amusement park rides]].  G-LOC incidents have caused fatal accidents in high performance aircraft capable of sustaining high ''g'' for extended periods.  [[High-G training]] for pilots of high performance aircraft or spacecraft often includes ground training for G-LOC in special [[centrifuge#Aeronautics and astronautics|centrifuges]], with some profiles exposing pilots to 9 ''g''s for a sustained period.

==Effects of ''g''-forces==
[[File:Gforce demo2.webm|alt=A simulation of the effects of g-forces on humans. As time progresses, tunnel vision occurs and nearly progresses to complete blackout.|thumb|A simulation of the effects of g-forces on humans. As time progresses, tunnel vision occurs and nearly progresses to complete blackout.]]
Under increasing positive ''g''-force, blood in the body will tend to move from the head toward the feet. For higher intensity or longer duration, this can manifest progressively as:

* [[Greyout (medical)|Greyout]] - a loss of color vision
* [[Tunnel vision]] - loss of peripheral vision, retaining only the center vision
* Blackout - a complete loss of vision  but retaining consciousness.
* G-LOC - where consciousness is lost.

Under negative ''g'', blood pressure will increase in the head, running the risk of the dangerous condition known as [[redout]], with too much blood pressure in the head and eyes.

Because of the high level of sensitivity that the eye’s retina has to hypoxia, symptoms are usually first experienced visually. As the retinal blood pressure decreases below [[Intraocular pressure|globe pressure]] (usually 10–21&amp;nbsp;mm Hg), blood flow begins to cease to the retina, first affecting perfusion farthest from the optic disc and retinal artery with progression towards central vision.  Skilled pilots can use this loss of vision as their indicator that they are at maximum turn performance without losing consciousness. Recovery is usually prompt following removal of ''g''-force but a period of several seconds of disorientation may occur.  Absolute incapacitation is the period of time when the aircrew member is physically unconscious and averages about 12 seconds. Relative incapacitation is the period in which the consciousness has been regained, but the person is confused and remains unable to perform simple tasks. This period averages about 15 seconds. Upon regaining cerebral blood flow, the G-LOC victim usually experiences myoclonic convulsions (often called the ‘funky chicken’) and often full amnesia of the event is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;http://goflightmedicine.com/pulling-gs/&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief but vivid dreams have been reported to follow G-LOC. If G-LOC occurs at low altitude, this momentary lapse can [[Controlled flight into terrain|prove fatal]] and even highly experienced pilots can pull straight to a G-LOC condition without first perceiving the visual onset warnings that would normally be used as the sign to back off from pulling any more ''g''s.

The human body is much more tolerant of ''g''-force when it is applied [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|laterally]] (across the body) than when applied [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|longitudinally]] (along the length of the body).  Unfortunately most sustained ''g''-forces incurred by pilots is applied longitudinally. This has led to experimentation with [[Gloster Meteor F8 "Prone Pilot"|prone pilot]] aircraft designs which lies the pilot face down or (more successfully) reclined positions for astronauts.

==Thresholds==

The ''g'' thresholds at which these effects occur depend on the training, age and fitness of the individual.  An un-trained individual not used to the ''G''-straining manoeuvre can black out between 4 and 6 ''g'', particularly if this is pulled suddenly.  A trained, fit individual wearing a ''g'' suit and practicing the straining manoeuvre can, with some difficulty, sustain up to 9''g'' without loss of consciousness.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The '''German Studies Association''' ('''GSA''') is an international organization of scholars in [[history]], [[literature]], [[economics]], [[cultural studies]], and [[political science]] who study [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. The organization began in 1976 as the Western Association for German Studies, and was renamed as the GSA in 1983 after transforming itself into first a North American organization, and then an international one. The association awards the annual ''Sybil Halpern Milton Memorial Book Prize''.

==History==
The founder and long-time executive director of the GSA was Professor Gerald R. Kleinfeld of [[Arizona State University]]. He also served as the first editor of the association's scholarly journal, the ''[[German Studies Review]]'', which was first published in 1978. The executive director's position is currently held by Professor [[David E. Barclay]] of [[Kalamazoo College]], while the ''German Studies Review'' is edited by Professor Sabine Hake of the [[University of Texas, Austin]]. The association is governed by a Board elected by the members in accordance with the GSA by-laws. The GSA holds an annual conference each autumn in a North American location.

A '''hot spare''' or '''warm spare''' or '''hot standby''' is used as a [[failover]] mechanism to provide reliability in [[system configuration]]s.  The hot spare is active and connected as part of a working system.  When a key component fails, the hot spare is switched into operation. More generally, a hot standby can be used to refer to any device or system that is held in readiness to overcome an otherwise significant start-up delay.

==Examples==
Examples of hot spares are components such as [[A/V switch]]es, [[computer]]s, [[network printer]]s, and [[hard disk]]s.  The equipment is powered on, or considered "hot," but not actively functioning in (i.e. used by) the system.

[[Electrical generator]]s may be held on hot standby, or a steam train may be held at the shed fired up (literally hot) ready to replace a possible failure of an engine in service.

==Explanation==
In designing a reliable system, it is recognized that there will be failures. At the extreme, a complete system can be duplicated and kept up to date—so in the event of the primary system failing, the secondary system can be switched in with little or no interruption. More often, a hot spare is a single vital component without which the entire system would fail. The spare component is integrated into the system in such a way that in the event of a problem, the system can be altered to use the spare component. This may be done automatically or manually, but in either case it is normal to have some means of error detection. A hot spare does not necessarily give 100% availability or protect against temporary loss of the system during the switching process; it is designed to significantly reduce the time that the system is unavailable.

Hot standby may have a slightly different connotation of being active but not productive to hot spare, that is it is a state rather than object. For example, in a national power grid, the supply of power needs to be balanced to demand over a short term. It can take many hours to bring a coal-fired power station up to productive temperatures. To allow for load balancing, generator turbines may be kept running with the generators switched off so as peaks of demand occur, the generators can rapidly be switched on to balance the load. Being in the state of being ready to run is known as hot standby. Though it is not a modern phenomenon, steam train operators might hold a spare steam engine at a terminus fired up, as starting an engine cold would take a significant amount of time.

The spare may be similar component or system, or it may be a system of reduced performance, designed to cope for the duration of the time to repair and recover the original component. In high availability systems, it is common to design so that not only is there a spare that can quickly be switched in, but also that the failed component can be repaired or replaced without stopping the system - this is known as [[hot swapping]]. It may be considered that the probability of a second failure is low, and therefore the system is designed simply to allow operation to continue until a suitable maintenance period. The appropriate solution is normally determined by balancing the costs of implementing the availability against the likelihood of a problem and the severity of that problem. there are two types of hot standby:
1. hot standby master - slave
2. hot standby in shearing mode

==Computer usage==
A '''hot spare disk''' is a disk or group of disks used to automatically or manually, depending upon the hot spare policy, replace a failing or failed disk in a [[RAID]] configuration. The hot spare disk reduces the [[mean time to recovery]] (MTTR) for the [[RAID]] redundancy group, thus reducing the probability of a second disk failure and the resultant data loss that would occur in any singly redundant RAID (e.g., RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-10). Typically, a hot spare is available to replace a number of different disks and systems employing a hot spare normally require a redundant group to allow time for the data to be generated onto the spare disk. During this time the system is exposed to data loss due to a subsequent failure, and therefore the automatic switching to a spare disk reduces the time of exposure to that risk compared to manual discovery and implementation.

The concept of hot spares is not limited to hardware, but also software systems can be held in a state of readiness, for example a database server may have a software copy on hot standby, possibly even on the same machine to cope with the various factors that make a database unreliable, such as the impact of disc failure, poorly written queries or database software errors.

==Hot standby operation in railway signalling==

At least two units of the same type will be powered up, receiving the same set of inputs, performing identical computations and producing identical outputs in a nearly-synchronous manner. The outputs are typically physical outputs (individual ON/OFF type digital signals, or analog signals), or serial data messages wrapped in suitable protocols depending upon the nature of their intended use. Outputs from only one unit (designated as the master or on-line unit, via application logic) are used to control external devices (such as switches, signals, on-board propulsion/braking control devices, etc.) or simply to provide displays. The other unit is a hot-standby or a hot spare unit, ready to take over if the master unit fails. When the master unit fails, an automatic failover to the hot spare occurs within a very short time and the outputs from the hot spare, now the master unit, are delivered to the controlled devices and displays. The controlled devices and displays may experience a short blip or disturbance during the failover time.  However, they can be designed to tolerate/ignore the disturbances so that the overall system operation is not affected.

==Hot standby operation of vacuum tubes==
This means that a device, or section of a device, that may need to be activated instantly, is kept with the [[vacuum tube]]s (pre-)heated but the anode voltage supply switched off. This causes normal [[Hot cathode|cathode coatings]] to fail prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reprise.com/host/tektronix/reference/cathode.asp Cathode interface]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the emotion|irritability}}
'''Irritation''', in [[biology]] and [[physiology]], is a state of [[inflammation]] or painful reaction to [[allergy]] or cell-lining damage. A stimulus or agent which induces the state of irritation is an '''irritant'''. Irritants are typically thought of as chemical agents (for example [[phenol]] and [[capsaicin]]) but mechanical, thermal (heat), and radiative stimuli (for example [[ultraviolet light]] or [[ionising radiation]]s) can also be irritants. Irritation also has non-clinical usages referring to bothersome physical or psychological [[pain]] or discomfort.

Irritation can also be induced by some allergic response due to exposure of some allergens for example contact dermatitis, irritation of mucosal membranes and pruritus. Mucosal membrane is the most common site of irritation because it contains secretory glands that release mucous which attracts the allergens due to its sticky nature.

Chronic irritation is a medical term signifying that afflictive health conditions have been present for a while. There are many disorders that can cause chronic irritation, the majority involve the skin, vagina, eyes and lungs.

==Irritation in organisms==
In higher organisms, an [[allergy|allergic response]] may be the cause of irritation. An [[allergen]] is defined distinctly from an irritant, however, as allergy requires a specific interaction with the [[immune system]] and is thus dependent on the (possibly unique) sensitivity of the organism involved while an irritant, classically, acts in a non-specific manner.

It is a form of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], but conversely, if one is stressed by unrelated matters, mild imperfections can cause more irritation than usual: one is '''irritable'''; see also [[sensitivity (human)]].

In more basic organisms, the status of [[pain]] is the [[perception]] of the being stimulated, which is not observable although it may be shared (see [[Pain#Gate control|gate control theory of pain]]).

[[File:Pearl oyster.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Pearl oyster]]]]
It is not proven that oysters can feel pain, but it is known that they react to irritants. When an irritating object becomes trapped within an oyster's shell, it deposits layers of calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), slowly increasing in size and producing a [[pearl]]. This is purely a defense mechanism, to trap a potentially threatening irritant such as a parasite inside its shell, or an attack from outside, injuring the mantle tissue. The oyster creates a pearl sac to seal off the irritation.

It has also been observed that an amoeba avoids being prodded with a pin, but there is not enough evidence to suggest how much it feels this. Irritation is apparently the only universal [[sense]] shared by even single-celled creatures.

It is postulated that most such beings also feel pain, but this is a projection – [[empathy]]. Some philosophers, notably [[René Descartes]], denied it entirely, even for such higher [[mammal]]s as dogs or [[primate]]s like [[monkey]]s; Descartes considered [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] a pre-requisite for the feeling of pain.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Types ==

===Eye irritation===
[[File:Infant with blepharitis on the right side.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Infant with [[blepharitis]] on the right eye]]

Modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jaakkola, Maritta S. and Jouni J. K. Jaakkola. "Office Equipment and Supplies: A Modern Occupational Health Concern?", [[American Journal of Epidemiology]], 1999, pp. 1223, Vol. 150, No. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, reports have linked mucosal, skin, and general symptoms to work with self-copying paper. Emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes. These symptoms have been related to [[Sick Building Syndrome]], which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes, skin, and upper airways, headache and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nordström K., D. Norbäck, and R. Akselsson. "Influence of indoor air quality and personal factors on the sick building syndrome (SBS) in Swedish geriatric hospitals.", Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 1995, pp. 170-176, Vol. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye is also a source of chronic irritation. Disorders like [[Sjögren's syndrome]], where one does not make tears, can cause a dry eye sensation which feels very unpleasant. The condition is difficult to treat and is lifelong. Besides artificial tears, there is a drug called Restasis which may help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dryeyeinfo.org/Dry_Eye_In_Depth.htm Dry Eye Diganosis And Treatment] Dry Eye Diagnosis And Treatment. Retrieved on 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blepharitis]] is dryness and itching on the upper eyelids. This condition is often seeing in young people and can lead to reddish dry eye and scaly eyebrows. To relieve the itching sensation, one may need to apply warm compresses and use topical [[corticosteroid]] creams.

=== Skin ===
[[File:Eczema-arms.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Eczema]] arms]]
[[Eczema]] is another cause of chronic irritation and affects millions of individuals. Eczema simply means a dry skin which is itchy. The condition usually starts at an early age and continues throughout life. The major complaint of people who suffer from eczema is an itchy dry skin. Sometimes, the itching will be associated with a skin [[rash]]. The affected areas are always dry, scaly, reddish and may ooze sometimes. Eczema cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. One should use moisturizers, use cold compresses and avoid frequent hot showers. There are over the counter corticosteroids creams which can be applied. Sometimes, an anti [[histamine]] has to be used to prevent the chronic itching sensations. There are also many individuals who have allergies to a whole host of substances like nuts, hair, [[dander]], plants and fabrics. For these individuals, even the minimal exposure can lead to a full blown skin rash, itching, wheezing and coughing. Unfortunately, other than avoidance, there is no other cure. There are allergy shots which can help desensitize against an [[allergen]] but often the results are poor and the treatments are expensive. Most of these individuals with chronic irritation from allergens usually need to take anti histamines or use a [[bronchodilator]] to relieve symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://health.lifestyle.yahoo.ca/condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=157 Eczema Condition Factsheets] Yahoo Health. Retrieved on 2010-01-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common irritation disorder in females is [[intertrigo]]. This disorder is associated with chronic irritation under folds of skin. This is typically seen under large breasts, groins and folds of the abdomen in obese individuals. Candida quickly grows in warm moist areas of these folds and presents as a chronic itch. Over time, the skin becomes red and often oozes.
[[Perspiration]] is also a chronic type of irritation which can be very annoying. Besides being socially unacceptable, sweat stain the clothes and can present with a foul odor. In some individuals, the warm moist areas often become easily infected. The best way to treat excess sweating is good hygiene, frequent change of clothes and use of deodorants/antiperspirants.

=== Vaginal irritation ===
[[File:Herpes(PHIL 1573 lores).jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Herpes simplex]] lesion of lower lip, second day after onset]]
One of the most common areas of the body associated with irritation is the [[vagina]]. Many women complain of an itch, dryness, or discharge in the [[perineum]] at some point in their lives. There are several causes of vaginal irritation including fungal [[vaginitis]] (like candida) or [[trichomoniasis]]. Often, [[herpes simplex]] infection of the mouth or genitalia can be recurrent and prove to be extremely irritating.
Sometimes, the irritation can be of the chronic type and it can be so intense that it also causes painful intercourse. Aside from infections, chronic irritation of the vagina may be related to the use of contraceptives and condoms made from latex. The majority of contraceptives are made of synthetic chemicals which can induce allergies, rash and itching. Sometimes the lubricant used for intercourse may cause irritation.
Another cause of irritation in women is post menopausal vaginitis. The decline in the female sex hormones leads to development of dryness and itching in the vagina. This is often accompanied by painful [[sexual intercourse]]. Cracks and tears often develop on outer aspects of the labia which becomes red from chronic scratching. Post menopausal vaginitis can be treated with short term use of vaginal [[estrogen]] [[pessary]] and use of a [[moisturizer]].

=== Lungs ===
[[File:Tobacco diagram.png|thumb|right|180px|How [[tobacco]] affects your body]]
Individuals who smoke or are exposed to smog or other airborne pollutants can develop a condition known as [[COPD]]. In this disorder, there is constant irritation of the [[Vertebrate trachea|breathing tubes]] (trachea) and the small airways. The constant irritation results in excess production of mucus which makes breathing difficult. Frequently, these individuals wake up in the morning with copious amounts of foul smelling [[mucus]] and a cough which lasts all day. [[Wheeze]] and heavy [[phlegm]] are common findings. COPD is a lifelong disorder and there is no cure. Eventually most people develop recurrent [[pneumonia]], lack any type of endurance, and are unable to work productively. One of the ways to avoid chronic bronchitis is to stop or not smoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/articles/280.html What is chronic bronchitis] Family Doctor.

=== Stomach ===

[[Gastritis]] or stomach upset is a common irritating disorder affecting millions of people. Gastritis is basically inflammation of the stomach wall lining and has many causes. Smoking, excess alcohol consumption and the use of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), such as [[ibuprofen]], account for the majority of causes of gastritis. In some cases, gastritis may develop after surgery, a major burn, infection or emotional stress. The most common symptoms of gastritis include sharp abdominal pain which may radiate to the back. This may be associated with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], abdominal [[bloating]] and a lack of appetite. When the condition is severe it may even result in loss of blood on the stools. The condition often comes and goes for years because most people continue to drink alcohol or use [[NSAIDs]]. Treatment includes the use of antacids or acid neutralizing drugs, antibiotics, and avoiding spicy food and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gastritis/DS00488 gastritis Information] Mayo Clinic.

'''Kunstschutz''' (''art protection'')  is the German term for the principle of preserving cultural heritage and artworks during armed conflict, especially during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]], with the stated aim of protecting the enemy's art and returning after the end of hostilities. It is associated with the image of the "art officer" (Kunstoffizier) or "art expert" (Kunstsachverständiger).

The Allies instituted a [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] tasked with identifying, locating, securing, storing, and returning stolen art after the war.

==History==

===World War I===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
The Germans' lack of respect for the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on land warfare created in 1899 and 1907, which had included the protection of cultural property, led to international shock at the burning of [[Leuven]] University Library in Belgium and the bombardment of [[Reims Cathedral]] in France, both in 1914 (the Louvain library would be re-formed and rebuilt in the 1920s but destroyed again in the 1940 [[Battle of France]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Schivelbusch, ''Die Bibliothek von Löwen. Eine Episode aus der Zeit der Weltkriege''&lt;/ref&gt;). To counter these protests, counterbalance the destruction, redeem itself in the eyes of international agencies and regain its image as the land of culture ''par excellence'', German propaganda created the principle of ''Kunstschutz''.&lt;ref&gt;"Trésors artistiques sauvegardés au musée de [[Valenciennes]]",  ''Propyläen Weltgeschichte'' by Walter Goetz (ed.), vol 10&lt;/ref&gt; This principle allowed Germany to experiment with new formulas for saving and developing cultural heritage and originated many, often fertile initiatives. Clemen, professor of art history at the [[University of Bonn]] and inspector of monuments in the [[Rhineland]], was one of the principle's first instigators. A German soldier 'saved' cultural objects in [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], though these were only returned in 1998, whilst a painting similarly removed from [[Douai]] museum only returned in 2000 after being discovered at a sale in Switzerland. The museum at [[Metz]] has put on an exhibition on the activities of its former German curator, the archaeologist [[Johann Baptist Keune]], in protecting the artistic heritage of the Moselle during the conflict.

===Inter-war period===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
After assuming power in 1933, Hitler and other nazis started [[anti-semitic]] policies designed to degrade and humiliate German Jews. Their aim was ultimately to exile or murder their victims, and steal their worldly possessions, including any artwork such as [[paintings]], [[drawings]] and [[printmaking|prints]], as well as [[furniture]], [[antiques]], [[books]], [[tapestries]], [[carpets]] and so on. [[Adolf Hitler]] was an unsuccessful artist who was denied admission to the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]]. Nonetheless, he thought of himself as a connoisseur of the arts, and in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' he ferociously attacked modern art as degenerate, including: [[Cubism]]; [[Futurism]]; and [[Dadaism]]; all of which he considered the product of a decadent twentieth century society. When in 1933 Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]], he enforced his aesthetic ideal on the nation. The types of art that were favoured amongst the Nazi party were classical portraits and landscapes by [[Old Masters]], particularly those of Germanic origin. Modern art that did not match this was dubbed [[degenerate art]] by the Third Reich, and all that was found in Germany's state museums was to be sold or destroyed. With the sums raised, the Fuhrer's objective was to establish the European Art Museum in [[Linz]]. Other Nazi dignitaries, like [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]] and Foreign Affairs minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|von Ribbentrop]], were also intent on taking advantage of German military conquests to increase their private art collections.

The art dealers [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Moeller and Bernhard Boehmer set up shop in [[Schloss Niederschonhausen]], just outside [[Berlin]], to sell the near-16,000 cache of paintings and sculptures which Hitler and Göring removed from the walls of German museums in 1937-38. They were first put on display in the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich on 19 July 1937, with the Nazi leaders inviting public mockery by two million visitors. Propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] in a radio broadcast called Germany's degenerate artists "garbage". Hitler opened the Haus der Kunst exhibition with a speech, at the end of which saliva fell out of his mouth in rage. In it he described German art as suffering "a great and fatal illness".

===Burning of artwork===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
[[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] and his colleagues did not have much success with their sales, mainly because art labelled "rubbish" had small appeal. So on 20 March 1939 they set fire to 1,004 paintings and sculptures and 3,825 [[watercolours]], [[drawings]] and [[printmaking|prints]] in the courtyard of the Berlin Fire Department, an act of infamy similar to their earlier well-known [[book burning]]s. The propaganda act raised the attention they hoped. The Basel Museum in Switzerland arrived with 50,000 Swiss francs to spend.  Shocked art lovers came to buy. What is unknown after these sales is how many paintings were kept by Gurlitt, Buchholz, Moeller and Boehmer and sold by them to Switzerland and America - ships crossed the Atlantic from Lisbon - for personal gain.

While the Nazis were in power, they plundered cultural property from every territory they occupied. This was conducted in a systematic manner with organizations specifically created to determine which public and private collections were most valuable to the Nazi Regime. Some of the objects were earmarked for Hitler's never realized [[Führermuseum]], some objects went to other high-ranking officials such as [[Hermann Göring]], while other objects were traded to fund Nazi activities.

===World War II===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]
In 1940, an organization known as the ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete]]'' (The [[Reichsleiter]] Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories), or ERR, was formed, headed for [[Alfred Rosenberg]] by [[:de:Gerhard Utikal|Gerhard Utikal]]. The first operating unit, the western branch for France, Belgium and the Netherlands, called the ''Dienststelle Westen'' (Western Agency), was located in Paris. The chief of this Dienststelle was [[:de:Kurt von Behr|Kurt von Behr]]. Its original purpose was to collect [[Jew]]ish and [[Freemasons|Freemasonic]] books and documents, either for destruction, or for removal to Germany for further "study". However, late in 1940, [[Hermann Göring]], who in fact controlled the ERR, issued an order that effectively changed the mission of the ERR, mandating it to seize "Jewish" art collections and other objects. The [[war loot]] had to be collected in a central place in Paris, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Museum Jeu de Paume]]. At this collection point worked [[art historian]]s and other personnel who inventoried the loot before sending it to Germany. Göring also commanded that the loot would first be divided between Hitler and himself. For this reason, from the end of 1940 to the end of 1942 he traveled twenty times to Paris. In the Museum Jeu de Paume, art dealer [[Bruno Lohse]] staged 20 expositions of the newly looted art objects, especially for Göring, from which Göring selected at least 594 pieces for his own collection. Göring made Lohse his liaison-officer and installed him in the ERR in March 1941 as the deputy leader of this unit. Items which Hitler and Göring did not want were made available to other Nazi leaders. Under Rosenberg and Göring's leadership, the ERR seized 21,903 art objects from German-occupied countries.
Other Nazi looting organizations included the Dienststelle Mühlmann, operated by [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], which Göring also controlled and operated primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium, and a Sonderkommando Kuensberg connected to the minister of foreign affairs [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], which operated first in France, then in Russia and North Africa.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] later ordered that all confiscated works of art were to be made directly available to him. Art collections from prominent Jewish families, including the [[Rothschilds]], the [[Rosenbergs]] and the [[Jacques Goudstikker|Goudstikkers]] and the [[Schloss Family]] were targeted because of their significant value. By the end of the war, the Third Reich amassed hundreds of thousands of cultural objects.

In Western Europe, with the advancing German troops, were elements of the 'von Ribbentrop Battalion', named after [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. These men were responsible for entering private and institutional libraries in the occupied countries and removing any materials of interest to the Germans, especially items of scientific, technical or other informational value.

The painting, ''Carlo III di Borbone che visita il papa Benedetto XIV nella coffee-house del Quirinale a Roma'' by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]],  was taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]]; it hangs today in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] (inv. Q 205)]]

Kunstschutz's altruistic image in World War I aided its reinstatement in World War II. On the initiative of Marshal [[Hermann Göring]], a specialist military corps known as the ''Kunstschutz'' was reactivated following the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] of September 1943 to requisition Italian artworks and transport them to Germany, under the pretext of saving them from Allied bombing. In [[Florence]] 58 crates of marble and bronze statues (by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]] among others), 26 ancient Greek statues, 291 large paintings (including works by [[Titian]], [[Botticelli]] and [[Raphael]]) and 25 crates of smaller paintings set out for Germany and Austria in convoys which many Italian intelligence officers secretly followed and reported back on to their government and thus to the Allies. One of those officers was the anti-Fascist [[Rodolfo Siviero]], who transmitted his reports to the Allies via his partisan contacts and continued to hunt down and return looted and illegally acquired Italian artworks from Germany after 1945. One of those he returned was the  ''Spiridon Leda'' (1505–1515) from the [[Leonardo da Vinci]] school, acquired by Göring before the war. In Naples the national museums were looted, with paintings taken including the ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' by Titian, ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], the [[Antea (Parmigianino)|''Portrait of a young woman, known as Antea'']] by [[Parmigianino]] and the ''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' from [[Pompeii]].

[[Goebbels]] had also edited a 1000-page inventory of French artworks in the [[Zone occupée|occupied zone]] of France. Count [[Franz Wolff-Metternich]] was responsible for the ''Kunstschutz'' in France from 1940 to 1942 and most works in French museums were taken&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} Michel Rayssac and Christophe Pincemaille, ''L'exode des musées, histoire des œuvres d'art sous l'occupation''&lt;/ref&gt; Collections belonging to Jews such as the [[Rothschild]]s and the [[Pierre David-Weill|David-Weill]] family were evacuated using the funds of the French national museums and gathered together in the Musée du Jeu de Paume, where Göring took his pick before putting them all in special trains bound for Berlin. [[Rose Valland]], one of the French curators, took secret notes on the contents of each train out. [[Ribbentrop]], the German foreign minister, tried to get hold of ''Diana Bathing'' by [[François Boucher]], whilst [[Hitler]] himself took part of [[Alfred Schloss]]'s collection of 300 Dutch paintings for his personal museum at [[Linz]].

German art looting also occurred in every state invaded and occupied by Germany, but especially Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14996">'''Language deprivation''' is associated with the lack of linguistic stimuli that are necessary for the [[language acquisition]] processes in an individual. Research has shown that early exposure to a first language will predict future language outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummins|first1=Jim|title=The Relationship between American Sign Language and English|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267559246_The_Relationship_between_American_Sign_Language_Proficiency_and_English_Academic_Development_A_Review_of_the_Research_1|website=Research Gate|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments involving language deprivation are very scarce due to the ethical controversy associated with it. Roger Shattuck, an American writer, called language deprivation research "The Forbidden Experiment" because it required the deprivation of a normal human.&lt;ref&gt;Shattuck, Roger (1994) [1980]. ''The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron''. Kodansha International.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, experiments were performed by depriving animals of social stimuli to examine [[psychosis]].  Although there has been no formal experimentation on this topic, there are several cases of language deprivation. The combined research on these cases has furthered the research in the [[critical period hypothesis]] in language acquisition.

==Cases of language deprivation==

===Genie===
The most well-documented case of a language-deprived child was that of [[Genie (wild child)|Genie]]. Genie was discovered in 1971 in the family home, where she was recognized as highly abnormal. A social [[welfare agency]] took her into custody and admitted Genie into a hospital. Before discovery, Genie had lived strapped and harnessed into a chair. Genie, 13 years of age upon discovery, was malnourished, insensitive to tactile senses, and silent even upon being evoked; however she had proper social skills and she was able to maintain [[eye contact]] with caregivers, giving the impression that she understood instruction. After being discharged from the hospital she was put in [[foster care]] where she received "informal" training.

The first tests of language were taken three years after her discovery. She was given a variety of language test measures to test her sound skills, comprehension skills, and grammatical skills. She was able to discriminate between initial and final consonants.  However, she lacked pitch and volume control, her speech was described as high pitched and breathy with sound distortions, [[consonant cluster]]s, neutralizing vowels, dropping final consonants, and reducing consonants. She was able to comprehend instructions but was dependent on [[pantomime]] and gesture.  Genie was capable of discriminating affirmation from negative, [[comparative adjective]]s, and colour words. After four years of language stimulation, her linguistic performance was similar to that of a normal two-year-old infant. She had poor performance in complex sentences, interchangeably used the pronouns "you" and "me", and lacked the question form of sentence structure. Further studies were conducted focusing on the physiological state of Genie. She was right-handed but neurological tests showed that she processed her language in the right hemisphere. Normally right-handed people process language in the left hemisphere. She excelled in right-hemisphere processed tasks, such as [[face perception]], holistic recall of unrelated objects, and number perception.  Genie's language skills were deemed as poor, and this was linked to the notion that she began to learn language when she was 13½.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. pp. 113–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pines, M. (1981). The Civilizing of Genie. ''Psychology Today'', 15(9), 28. Accessed 3/11/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaspar Hauser===
Another case of language deprivation was of [[Kaspar Hauser]], who was kept in a dungeon in Germany until the age of 17. He did have some contact with humans during his isolation. Sources stated that he had a small amount of language; other sources state that upon discovery he spoke a garbled sentence. He was able to learn enough language to attempt to write an [[autobiography]] and to also become a legal clerk. However, five years after discovery he was stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anna===
Anna was born March 6, 1932, and was an [[illegitimate child]]. She was put in isolation by her mother because of this. Anna was kept tied to a chair and was malnourished due to being fed [[milk]] only. Upon discovery on February 6, 1938, she was sent to a county home. Further examination of Anna determined that she was very poor physiologically but that her senses were intact. During her stay at the county, she gained some [[body weight]] and began to build [[muscle]] in her body. She lived at the county home for nine months until she was moved to a foster home. Upon leaving she was still very unsocial, because there was no predetermined caregiver in the county home, which consisted of over 300 inmates and one nurse; often she was taken care of by inmates. The caregiver at the foster home used the same method to talk to Anna by which a mother would talk to their infant. During her tenure at the foster home she underwent some mental development and was similar to a one-year-old. After a year at the foster home she was sent to a school for defective children. Although she could not speak at the time, she had a comprehension of instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. (1940) The Extreme Isolation of a Child. ''American Journal of Sociology'', 45(4), 554–565. Accessed 3/9/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isabelle===
Another case of a child deprived at a young age is that of Isabelle. Confined to a room with a [[deaf]] and [[muteness|mute]] mother, she spent 6½ years in silence without any language stimulation. Upon discovery she was sent to a hospital where she was monitored for her apathetic behaviour. Now in a ward with children, she began to imitate other children in the ward to request attention. She had also begun language training. Eighteen months into her training her repertoire of words was estimated to be 1500–2500 words; she was also able to produce complex sentence structures. Throughout her training she began to use correct inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronoun]]s, and [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feral children==
[[Feral child]]ren are children discovered by society to be living in the wild with the assumption that they were raised by animals. It is stated that such children are deprived of human associations and are too strongly conditioned with animal behaviours, such that the human development is permanently inhibited and the animal inhibitions are never lost throughout life. There are several known cases of feral children relearning language, the most well-known is Victor.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, W. (1941) The Significance of a Feral Man. The American Journal of Psychology, 54(3), 425–432.&lt;/ref&gt; Victor was found at the age of 13 and was given to Dr. Itard, who "experimented" on the child. Victor was also known as the "[[Victor of Aveyron|wild boy of Aveyron]]". He was characterized to be insensitive to temperature, uncivilized and to run on all fours. Dr. [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] conducted training over a period of 5 years, during which time Victor was able to recover some speech.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. p.104-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaf Children==
Scientists suggest that the best guarantee of good language outcomes for Deaf children is to establish Sign Language as a secure first language before a cochlear implant program (CIP) is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=4201085 | pmid=25368567 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00834 | volume=8 | title=Cochlear implantation (CI) for prelingual deafness: the relevance of studies of brain organization and the role of first language acquisition in considering outcome success | year=2014 | journal=Front Hum Neurosci | page=834 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M | last3 = Woll | first3 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because new hearing parents of deaf children are frequently{{when|date=May 2018}} advised by professionals without training in the field of [[Language acquisition by deaf children|language acquisition in deaf children]]{{dubious|date=May 2018}}, they are often{{weasel inline|date=May 2018}} advised to use sign as a last resort, only after the child has failed to learn spoken language{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. This subjects these children to language deprivation in the time before they are exposed to accessible language input{{dubious|date=May 2018}}, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of permanent, irreversible effects to their brains. These effects include not only a detrimental impact on [[language acquisition]], but other cognitive and mental health difficulties as well&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=May 2017|title=What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: The Risk of Language Deprivation by Impairing Sign Language Development in Deaf Children |journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961–965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y |pmc=5392137|pmid=28185206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The effects of language deprivation in deaf children, like hearing children, can include permanently affecting their ability to ever achieve proficiency in a language. Deaf children who do not learn to sign until later in life are more likely to process signed languages not as linguistic input, but as visual input, contrasting with children exposed from birth, who process signed language in the same region of the brain in which hearing people process spoken language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Additionally, studies show a notable decrease in sign language grammar skills of deaf adults who were not exposed to sign until after age 5 when compared to those exposed from birth, and an even greater decrease in those who were not exposed until after age 8, in some cases being so poor as to have near-coincidence levels of accuracy&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel I.|date=July 2007|title=When timing is everything: Age of first-language acquisition effects on second-language learning|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/when-timing-is-everything-age-of-firstlanguage-acquisition-effects-on-secondlanguage-learning/3B1A8327FF0E7926F858FE995BEC3074|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=537–549|doi=10.1017/s0142716407070294|issn=1469-1817|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This effect extends to spoken language as well. One study comparing [[English as a second or foreign language|English-as-a-second-language]] speakers showed that while deaf children who are signed to from birth have similar proficiency in spoken English to hearing ESL speakers, Deaf children who were not exposed to sign until entering school show a marked reduction in English proficiency. Note that this last group had been exposed to spoken English from birth; however, since auditory input was inaccessible to them, they failed to acquire spoken English as their first language, and therefore did not acquire language at all until learning ASL upon entering school&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.{{Verify source|reason=deaf children who use listening and spoken language have English skills on par with their hearing peers, as cited above -- this assertion appears to be only about the small subset of deaf children who do not successfully use listening and spoken language, but the reference is unclear|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Farr.DE672.foley.webm|thumb|Dan Foley shares his personal experience of being deprived of language.]]
While [[Cochlear implant|Cochlear implants]] may help in making spoken first language acquisition more possible, this effect is unreliable; children with Cochlear implants exposed only to spoken language can still show a serious lack of spoken language ability when compared to hearing peers. In contrast, implanted children exposed to signing from birth, a more accessible medium of language, do not show this deficiency, despite having spoken language as their second language. This suggests that even when implanted, the period of language deprivation prior to implantation is enough to seriously impact a child's [[language development]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== Personal experiences ===
[[File:Farr.DE672.timothyskaggs.webm|thumb|Timothy Skaggs shares his personal experience of being deprived of language.]]
To further understand the language deprivation within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, two personal videos collected based on two Deaf people's experiences with being deprived of language have been included on this page with subtitles. In one video, Dan Foley explains how he was deprived of language outside of his immediate family members, especially at school. It was not until later when he had access to a language that he could understand and apply to his education. His story helps us to get a better perspective on where language deprivation can happen, even at school. In another video, Timothy Skaggs explains his experience being deprived of language at home and school. He explains how deprived he was from incidental learning because he had no direct communication with anyone except for his interpreters at school. He missed out on family gatherings, social cues, and a normal childhood in general because he was always the last to know everything because of his limited access to spoken English. For more extended information on both stories, refer to the videos on this page.

==Research==

The "critical period of learning" hypothesis states that a person must be exposed to language by a certain age to acquire language. It is said to be associated with a period of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. It is also thought to end around the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, E.H.

'''Liudmila Grigorievna Kovnatskaya''' (born 5 February 1941) is a Russian musicologist. She is a professor at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov]] (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.

==Education==
She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.

==Professional experience==
Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers’ Union]], and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).

In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for "The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.

Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about [[Benjamin Britten]] (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and [[Saint Cecilia]], patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.

Prof Kovnatskaya’s research fields include [[Music of Russia|History of Russian Music]]; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on [[Dmitri Shostakovich|D. Shostakovich]]. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).

Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.

A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38185">'''Marine larval ecology''' is the study of the factors influencing dispersing [[larva]]e, which many [[marine invertebrates]] and [[fishes]] have. Marine animals with a larva typically release many larvae into the water column, where the larvae develop before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into adults.

Marine larvae can disperse over long distances, although determining the actual distance is challenging, because of their size and the lack of a good tracking method. Knowing dispersal distances is important for managing [[fishery|fisheries]], effectively designing marine reserves, and controlling [[invasive species]].

== Theories on the evolution of a biphasic life history ==
Larval dispersal is one of the most important topics in [[marine ecology]], today. Many marine invertebrates and many fishes have a bi-phasic life cycle with a [[pelagic]] larva or pelagic eggs that can be transported over long distances, and a [[demersal]] or [[benthic]] adult.&lt;ref&gt;Grosberg, R.K. and D.R. Levitan. 1992. For adults only? Supply-side ecology and the history of larval biology. Trends Ecol. Evol. 7: 130-133.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several theories behind why these organisms have evolved this biphasic life history:&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, S. E., J. S. Shima, M. E. Hellberg, S. R. Thorrold, G. P. Jones, D. R. Robertson, S. G. Morgan, K. A. Selkoe, G. M. Ruiz, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evidence of self-recruitment in demersal marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 251-271.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Larvae use different food sources than adults, which decreases competition between life stages.
*Pelagic larvae can disperse large distances, colonize new territory, and move away from habitats that has become overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable.
*A long pelagic larval phase can help a species to break its [[parasite]] cycles.
*Pelagic larvae avoid benthic predators.

Dispersing as pelagic larvae can be risky. For example, while larvae do avoid benthic predators, they are still exposed to pelagic predators in the water column.

== Larval development strategies ==
&lt;!-- note: anchor tags in this section used by redirects --&gt;
Marine larvae develop via one of three strategies: Direct, lecithotrophic, or planktotrophic. Each strategy has risks of predation and the difficulty of finding a good settlement site.

'''Direct developing'''{{anchor|Direct development}} larvae look like the adult. They have typically very low dispersal potential, and are known as “crawl-away larvae,” because they crawl away from their egg after hatching. Some species of frogs and snails hatch this way.

'''Lecithotrophic'''{{anchor|Lecithotrophy}} larvae have greater dispersal potential than direct developers. Many fish species and some benthic invertebrates have lecithotrophic larvae, which have yolk droplets or a yolk sac for nutrition during dispersal. Though some lecithotrophic species can feed in the water column, too. But many, such as [[tunicates]], cannot, and so must settle before depleting their yolk. Consequently, these species have short pelagic larval durations and do not disperse long distances.

'''Planktotrophic'''{{anchor|Planktotrophy}} larvae feed while they are in the water column and can be over a long time pelagic and so disperse over long distances. This disperse ability is a key adaptation of benthic marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Strathmann, R. R., T. P. Hughes, A. M. Kuris, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, J. M. Pandolfi, and R. R. Warner. 2002. Evolution of local recruitment and its consequences for marine populations. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 377-396.&lt;/ref&gt; Planktotrophic larvae feed on [[phytoplankton]] and small [[zooplankton]], including other larvae. Planktotrophic development is the most common type of larval development, especially among benthic invertebrates.

Because planktotrophic larvae are for a long time in the water column and recruit successfully with low probability, early researchers developed the “lottery hypothesis”, which states that animals release huge numbers of larvae to increase the chances that at least one will survive, and that larvae cannot influence their probability of success.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, G. 1950. Reproductive and larval ecology of marine bottom invertebrates. Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 25: 1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden, J., Y. Iwasa, and C. Blaxter. 1985. Demographic theory for an open population with space-limited recruitment. Ecology 66: 54-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caley, M.J., M.H. Carr, M.A. Hixon, T.P. Hughes, G.P. Jones, and B. Menge. 1996. Recruitment and the local dynamics of open marine populations. Evolution 35: 1192-1205.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis views larval survival and successful recruitment as chance events, which numerous studies on larval behavior and ecology have since shown to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsford, M. J., J. M. Leis, A. Shanks, K. C. Lindeman, S. G. Morgan, and J. Pineda. 2002. Sensory environments, larval abilities, and local self-recruitment. Bull. Mar. Sci. 70(1) Suppl.: 309-340.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has been generally disproved, the larval lottery hypothesis represents an important understanding of the difficulties faced by larvae during their time in the water column.

== Predator Defense ==
Predation is a major threat to marine larvae, which are an important food source for many organisms. Invertebrate larvae in [[estuaries]] are particularly at risk because estuaries are nursery grounds for [[planktivorous fishes]]. Larvae have evolved strategies to cope with this threat, including direct defense and [[Anti-predator adaptation|avoidance]].

=== Direct Defense ===

Direct defense can include protective structures and chemical defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=Niels|last2=Hay|first2=Mark E.|date=1996-02-01|title=Palatability and Chemical Defense of Marine Invertebrate Larvae|journal=Ecological Monographs|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=431–450|doi=10.2307/2963489|issn=1557-7015|jstor=2963489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Planktivore|planktivorous]] fishes are gape-limited predators, meaning their prey is determined by the width of their open mouths, making larger larvae difficult to ingest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devries|first=Dennis R.|last2=Stein|first2=Roy A.|last3=Bremigan|first3=Mary T.|date=1998-11-01|title=Prey Selection by Larval Fishes as Influenced by Available Zooplankton and Gape Limitation|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|language=en|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1040–1050|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127&lt;1040:psblfa&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=1548-8659|hdl=1811/45384}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study proved that spines serve a protective function by removing spines from estuarine [[crab]] larvae and monitoring differences in predation rates between de-spined and intact larvae.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Morgan, S. G. 1989. Adaptive significance of spination in estuarine crab zoeae. Ecology 70: 462-482.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also showed that predator defense is also behavioral, as they can keep spines relaxed but erect them in the presence of predators.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Avoidance ===

Larvae can avoid predators on small and large spatial scales. Some larvae do this by sinking when approached by a predator. A more common avoidance strategy is to become active at night and remain hidden during the day to avoid visual predators. Most larvae and plankton undertake [[diel vertical migration]]s between deeper waters with less light and fewer predators during the day and shallow waters in the [[photic zone]] at night, where [[microalgae]] is abundant.&lt;ref&gt;Zaret, T.M. and J.S. Suffern. 1976. Vertical migration in zooplankton as a predator avoidance. Limnol. Oceanogr. 21: 804-813.&lt;/ref&gt; Estuarine invertebrate larvae avoid predators by developing in the open ocean, where there are fewer predators. This is done using reverse tidal vertical migrations. Larvae use tidal cycles and estuarine flow regimes to aid their departure to the ocean, a process that is well-studied in many estuarine crab species.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, T.W. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1979. Tidal vertical migration: An endogenous rhythm in estuarine crab larvae. Science 205: 1020-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tankersley, R.A. and R.B. Forward, Jr. 1994. Endogenous swimming rhythms in estuarine crab megalopae: implications for flood-tide transport. Mar. Biol. 118: 415-423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, C. and E. Naylor. 1996. Endogenous tidal rhythms of vertical migration in field collected zoea-1 larvae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas: implications for ebb-tide offshore dispersal. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 132: 71-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DiBacco, C., D. Sutton, and L. McConnico. 2001. Vertical migration behavior and horizontal distribution of brachyuran larvae in a low-inflow estuary: implications for bay-ocean exchange. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 217: 191-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of reverse tidal migration performed by crab species would begin with larvae being released on a nocturnal [[Tide|spring high tide]] to limit predation by planktivorous fishes. As the tide begins to ebbs, larvae swim to the surface to be carried away from the spawning site. When the tide begins to [[Tide|flood]], larvae swim to the bottom, where water moves more slowly due to the [[boundary layer]]. When the tide again changes back to ebb, the larvae swim to the surface waters and resume their journey to the ocean. Depending on the length of the estuary and the speed of the [[Ocean current|currents]], this process can take anywhere from one tidal cycle to several days.&lt;ref&gt;Forward, R.B. Jr, and R.A. Tankersley. 2001. Selective tidal-stream transport of marine animals. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Annu. Rev. 39: 305-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal and settlement ==
The most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a pelagic larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strathmann|first=Richard R.|date=1978-12-01|title=THE EVOLUTION AND LOSS OF FEEDING LARVAL STAGES OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=894–906|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1978.tb04642.x|pmid=28567936|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treml|first=Eric A.|last2=Roberts|first2=Jason J.|last3=Chao|first3=Yi|last4=Halpin|first4=Patrick N.|last5=Possingham|first5=Hugh P.|last6=Riginos|first6=Cynthia|date=2012-10-01|title=Reproductive Output and Duration of the Pelagic Larval Stage Determine Seascape-Wide Connectivity of Marine Populations|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/52/4/525/663573|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=525–537|doi=10.1093/icb/ics101|pmid=22821585|issn=1540-7063}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sessility (zoology)|Sessile]] and sedentary organisms such as [[barnacles]], tunicates, and mussels require a mechanism to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval durations on the order of weeks or months.&lt;ref&gt;Brothers, E.B., D.M. Williams, and P.F. Sale. 1983. Length of larval life in twelve families of fishes at “One Tree Lagoon,” Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Mar. Biol. 76: 319-324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheltema, R.S. 1986. On dispersal and planktonic larvae of benthic invertebrates: an eclectic overview and summary of problems. Bull. Mar. Sci. 39: 290-322.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] through several stages of development. For example, barnacles [[Ecdysis|molt]] through six [[Nauplius (larva)|naupliar]] stages before becoming a [[cyprid]] and seeking appropriate settlement substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=L. W. G.|last2=Crisp|first2=D. J.|date=1954-02-01|title=The larval stages of the Barnacle Balanus improvisus Darwin.|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=765–780|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1954.tb00203.x|issn=1469-7998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy can be risky. Some larvae have been shown to be able to delay their final [[metamorphosis]] for a few days or weeks, and most species cannot delay it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer, P., K. Paschke, and K. Anger. 2004. Stimulation of metamorphosis in an estuarine crab, Chasmagnathus granulata (Dana, 1851): temporal window of cue receptivity. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 311: 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J.S., M.J. Butler IV, and H. Matsuda. 2006. Investigations into some early-life history strategies for Caribbean spiny lobster and implications for pan-carib connectivity. J. Shellfish Res. 25: 731.&lt;/ref&gt; If these larvae metamorphose far from a suitable settlement site, they perish. Many invertebrate larvae have evolved complex behaviors and endogenous rhythms to ensure successful and timely settlement.

Many estuarine species exhibit swimming rhythms of reverse tidal vertical migration to aid in their transport away from their hatching site. Individuals can also exhibit tidal vertical migrations to reenter the estuary when they are competent to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Christy, J.H. and S.G. Morgan. 1998. Estuarine immigration by crab postlarvae: mechanisms, reliability and adaptive significance. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 174: 51-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

As larvae reach their final pelagic stage, they become much more [[Touch|tactile]]; clinging to anything larger than themselves. One study observed crab [[postlarvae]] and found that they would swim vigorously until they encountered a floating object, which they would cling to for the remainder of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Alan L. 1985. Behavioral basis of internal-wave-induced shoreward transport of megalopae of the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes. Marine Ecol. Prog. Series 24: 289-295.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that by clinging to floating debris, crabs can be transported towards shore due to the oceanographic forces of [[internal waves]],{{clarify|date=March 2013}} which carry floating debris shoreward regardless of the prevailing currents.

Once returning to shore, settlers encounter difficulties concerning their actual settlement and recruitment into the population. Space is a limiting factor for sessile invertebrates on [[rocky shore]]s. Settlers must be wary of adult [[filter feeders]], which cover substrate at settlement sites and eat particles the size of larvae. Settlers must also avoid becoming stranded out of water by waves, and must select a settlement site at the proper tidal height to prevent [[desiccation]] and avoid [[Competition#Competition in biology and ecology|competition]] and [[predation]]. To overcome many of these difficulties, some species rely on chemical cues to assist them in selecting an appropriate settlement site. These cues are usually emitted by adult [[conspecifics]], but some species cue on specific bacterial mats or other qualities of the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;Crisp, D.J. and P.S. Meadows. 1962. The chemical basis of gregariousness in cirripedes. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B158: 364-387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pawlik, J.R. 1986. Chemical induction of larval settlement and metamorphosis in the reef building tube worm; [[Phragmatopoma californica]] (Sabellidae: Polychaeta). Mar. Biol. 91: 51-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J.K., J.M. Elliott, and R.N. Mariscal. 1995. Host selection, location, and association behaviors of anemonefishes in field settlement experiments. Mar. Biol. 122: 377-390.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Larval Sensory Systems ==
Although with a [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] larva, many species can increase their dispersal range and decrease the risk of [[inbreeding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=February 1999|title=On the advantages and disadvantages of larval stages in benthic marine invertebrate life cycle|url=|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=177|pages=269–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larva comes with challenges: Marine larvae risk being washed away without finding a suitable habitat for settlement. Therefore, they have evolved many sensory systems:

=== Sensory Systems ===

==== Magnetic Fields ====
Far from shore, larvae are able to use magnetic fields to orient themselves towards the coast over large spatial scales.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kingsford|first=Michael J.|last2=Leis|first2=Jeffrey M.|last3=Shanks|first3=Alan|last4=Lindeman|first4=Kenyon C.|last5=Morgan|first5=Steven G.|last6=Pineda|first6=Jesús|date=2002-01-01|title=Sensory environments, larval abilities and local self-recruitment|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2002/00000070/a00101s1/art00005|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=70|issue=1|pages=309–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Jack|last2=Muheim|first2=Rachel|date=2017-08-15|title=Pre-settlement coral-reef fish larvae respond to magnetic field changes during the day|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/16/2874|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=220|issue=16|pages=2874–2877|doi=10.1242/jeb.159491|issn=0022-0949|pmid=28576824}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is additional evidence that species can recognize anomalies in the magnetic field to return to the same location multiple times throughout their life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the mechanisms that these species use is poorly understood, it appears that magnetic fields play an important role in larval orientation offshore, where other cues such as sound and chemicals may be difficult to detect.

==== Vision and non-visual light perception ====

[[Phototaxis]] (ability to differentiate between light and dark areas) is important to find a suitable habitat. Phototaxis evolved relatively quickly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jékely|first=Gáspár|date=2009-10-12|title=Evolution of phototaxis|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1531/2795|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=364|issue=1531|pages=2795–2808|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0072|issn=0962-8436|pmid=19720645|pmc=2781859}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taxa that lack developed eyes, such as [[Scyphozoa|schyphozoans]], use phototaxis to find shaded areas to settle away from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-04-18|title=Perception of light at settlement: a comparative study of two invertebrate larvae, a scyphozoan planula and a simple ascidian tadpole|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022098194001719|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|language=en|volume=187|issue=1|pages=51–61|doi=10.1016/0022-0981(94)00171-9|issn=0022-0981|last1=Svane|first1=Ib|last2=Dolmer|first2=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species that produce more complex larvae, such as fish, can use full vision&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to find a suitable habitat on small spatial scales.

==== Sound ====
Marine larvae use sound and vibrations to find a good habitat where they can settle and [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into juveniles. This behavior has been seen in fish&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  as well as in the larvae of [[scleractinia]]n corals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vermeij MJ, Marhaver KL, Huijbers CM, Nagelkerken I, Simpson SD | title = Coral larvae move toward reef sounds | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e10660 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20498831 | pmc = 2871043 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many families of coral reef fish are particularly attracted to high-[[frequency]] sounds produced by invertebrates,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=S.D.|last2=Meekan|first2=M.G.|last3=Jeffs|first3=A.|last4=Montgomery|first4=J.C.|last5=McCauley|first5=R.D.|title=Settlement-stage coral reef fish prefer the higher-frequency invertebrate-generated audible component of reef noise|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1861–1868|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.11.004|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which larvae use as an indicator of food availability and complex  habitat where they may be protected from predators. It is thought that larvae avoid low frequency sounds because they may be associated with transient fish or predators&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and is therefore not a reliable indicator of safe habitat.

The spatial range at which larvae detect and use sound waves is still uncertain, though some evidence suggests that it may only be reliable at very small scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaplan MB, Mooney TA | title = Coral reef soundscapes may not be detectable far from the reef | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 31862 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27550394 | pmc = 4994009 | doi = 10.1038/srep31862 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern that changes in [[community structure]] in [[nursery habitat]]s, such as [[seagrass]] beds, [[kelp]] forests, and [[mangrove]]s, could lead to a collapse in larval recruitment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossi|first=Tullio|last2=Connell|first2=Sean D.|last3=Nagelkerken|first3=Ivan|title=The sounds of silence: regime shifts impoverish marine soundscapes|journal=Landscape Ecology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=239–248|doi=10.1007/s10980-016-0439-x|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a decrease in sound-producing invertebrates. Other researchers argue that larvae may still successfully find a place to settle even if one cue is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Igulu|first=M.

==== Olfaction ====
Many marine organisms use [[olfaction]] (chemical cues in the form of scent) to locate a safe area to metamorphose at the end of their larval stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has been shown in both [[vertebrate]]s&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atema|first=Jelle|last2=Kingsford|first2=Michael J.|last3=Gerlach|first3=Gabriele|date=2002-10-04|title=Larval reef fish could use odour for detection, retention and orientation to reefs|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v241/p151-160/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=241|pages=151–160|doi=10.3354/meps241151|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dumas|first=Pascal|last2=Tiavouane|first2=Josina|last3=Senia|first3=Jocelyn|last4=Willam|first4=Andrew|last5=Dick|first5=Lency|last6=Fauvelot|first6=Cecile|title=Evidence of early chemotaxis contributing to active habitat selection by the sessile giant clam Tridacna maxima|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=452|pages=63–69|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2013.12.002|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that larvae are able to distinguish between water from the open ocean and water from more suitable nursery habitats such as [[lagoon]]s&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  and seagrass beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havel|first=Lisa N.|last2=Fuiman|first2=Lee A.|title=Settlement-Size Larval Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) Respond to Estuarine Chemical Cues|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|volume=39|issue=2|pages=560–570|doi=10.1007/s12237-015-0008-6|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical cues can be extremely useful for larvae, but may not have a constant presence, as water input can depend on currents and tidal flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leis|first=J.

=== Human Impacts on Sensory Systems ===
Recent research in the field of larval sensory biology has begun focusing more on how human impacts and environmental disturbance affect settlement rates and larval interpretation of different habitat cues. [[Ocean acidification]] due to [[anthropogenic climate change]] and [[sedimentation]] have become areas of particular interest.

==== Ocean Acidification ====
Ocean acidification has been shown to alter the way that pelagic larvae are able to process information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashur MM, Johnston NK, Dixson DL | title = Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Sensory Function in Marine Organisms | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–80 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28575440 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icx010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and production of the cues themselves.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossi T, Connell SD, Nagelkerken I | title = Silent oceans: ocean acidification impoverishes natural soundscapes by altering sound production of the world's noisiest marine invertebrate | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 283 | issue = 1826 | pages = 20153046 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26984624 | pmc = 4810867 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.3046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidification can alter larval interpretations of sounds, particularly in fish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castro JM, Amorim MC, Oliveira AP, Gonçalves EJ, Munday PL, Simpson SD, Faria AM | title = Painted Goby Larvae under High-CO2 Fail to Recognize Reef Sounds | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0170838 | pmid = 28125690 | pmc = 5268378 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0170838  | year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to settlement in suboptimal habitat. Though the mechanism for this process is still not fully understood, some studies indicate that this breakdown may be due to a decrease in size or density of their otoliths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bignami S, Enochs IC, Manzello DP, Sponaugle S, Cowen RK | title = Ocean acidification alters the otoliths of a pantropical fish species with implications for sensory function | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 18 | pages = 7366–70 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23589887 | pmc = 3645591 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1301365110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sounds produced by invertebrates that larvae rely on as an indicator of habitat quality can also change due to acidification. For example, [[Alpheidae|snapping shrimp]] produce different sounds that larvae may not recognize under acidified conditions due to differences in shell [[calcification]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hearing is not the only sense that may be altered under future ocean chemistry conditions. Evidence also suggests that larval ability to process olfactory cues was also affected when tested under future [[pH]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=B. M.|last2=Munday|first2=P. L.|last3=Jones|first3=G. P.|title=Rising CO2 concentrations affect settlement behaviour of larval damselfishes|journal=Coral Reefs|volume=31|issue=1|pages=229–238|doi=10.1007/s00338-011-0837-0|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red color cues that coral larvae use to find crustose [[coralline algae]], with which they have a [[Commensalism|commensal]] relationship, may also be in danger due to algal bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=T.|last2=Gilmour|first2=J. P.|date=2016-11-09|title=Seeing red: Coral larvae are attracted to healthy‑looking reefs|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v559/p65-71/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=559|pages=65–71|doi=10.3354/meps11902|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sedimentation ====
Sediment runoff, from natural storm events or human development, can also impact larval sensory systems and survival. One study focusing on red soil found that increased turbidity due to runoff negatively influenced the ability of fish larvae to interpret visual cues.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Connor|first=J. Jack|last2=Lecchini|first2=David|last3=Beck|first3=Hayden J.|last4=Cadiou|first4=Gwenael|last5=Lecellier|first5=Gael|last6=Booth|first6=David J.|last7=Nakamura|first7=Yohei|date=2016-01-01|title=Sediment pollution impacts sensory ability and performance of settling coral-reef fish|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=180|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1007/s00442-015-3367-6|pmid=26080759|issn=0029-8549|hdl=10453/41685}}&lt;/ref&gt; More unexpectedly, they also found that red soil can also impair olfactory capabilities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Self-recruitment ==
Marine ecologists are often interested in the degree of [[self-recruitment]] in populations. Historically, larvae were considered passive particles that were carried by ocean currents to faraway locations. This led to the belief that all marine populations were demographically open, connected by long distance larval transport. Recent work has shown that many populations are self-recruiting, and that larvae and juveniles are capable of purposefully returning to their natal sites. 
 
	Researchers take a variety of approaches to estimating [[population connectivity]] and self-recruitment, and several studies have demonstrated their feasibility. Jones et al.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. P., M. J. Milicich, M. J. Emslie and C. Lunow. 1999. Self-recruitment in a coral reef fish population. Nature 402: 802-804.&lt;/ref&gt; and Swearer et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, S. E., J. E. Caselle, D. W. Lea, and R. R. Warner. 1999. Larval rentention and recruitment in an island population of a coral-reef fish. Nature 402: 799-802.&lt;/ref&gt; for example,  investigated the proportion of fish larvae returning to their natal reef. Both studies found higher than expected self-recruitment in these populations using mark, release, and recapture sampling. These studies were the first to provide conclusive evidence of self-recruitment in a species with the potential to disperse far from its natal site, and laid the groundwork for numerous future studies.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, L. 2006. Recent progress in understanding larval dispersal: new directions and digressions. Int. Comp. Biol. 46: 282-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[Ichthyoplankton]] have a high mortality rate as they transition their food source from yolk sac to zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voss|first=Rüdiger|last2=Hinrichsen|first2=Hans-Harald|last3=Wieland|first3=Kai|date=2001-11-19|title=Model-supported estimation of mortality rates in Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias L.) larvae: the varying impact of 'critical periods'|journal=BMC Ecology|volume=1|pages=4|doi=10.1186/1472-6785-1-4|pmid=11737879|pmc=60663|issn=1472-6785}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that this mortality rate is related to inadequate zooplankton as well as an inability to move through the water effectively at this stage of development, leading to starvation. Many ichthyoplankton use suction to feed. [[Turgor pressure|Turgidity]] of water impairs the organisms’ ability to feed even when there is a high density of prey. Reducing these hydrodynamic constraints on cultivated populations could lead to higher yields for repopulation efforts and has been proposed as a means of conserving fish populations by acting at the larval level.&lt;ref&gt;China, V., and R. Holzman. 2014. Hydrodynamic starvation in first-feeding larval fishes. PNAS doi:10.1073/pnas.1323205111.&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of [[Marine protected area|marine reserves]] has been initiated for the conservation of the world’s marine larval populations. These areas restrict fishing and therefore increase the number of otherwise fished species. This leads to a healthier ecosystem and affects the number of overall species within the reserve as compared to nearby fished areas; however, the full effect of an increase in larger predator fish on larval populations is not currently known. Also, the potential for utilizing the motility of fish larvae to repopulate the water surrounding the reserve is not fully understood. Marine reserves are a part of a growing conservation effort to combat [[overfishing]]; however, reserves still only comprise about 1% of the world’s oceans. These reserves are also not protected from other human-derived threats, such as chemical pollutants, so they cannot be the only method of conservation without certain levels of protection for the water around them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bohnsack, J. A. 1992. Reef resource habitat protection: the forgotten factor. Marine Recreational Fisheries 14: 117-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

For effective conservation, it is important to understand the larval dispersal patterns of the species in danger, as well as the dispersal of [[invasive species]] and predators which could impact their populations. Understanding these patterns is an important factor when creating protocol for governing fishing and creating [[Marine protected area|reserves]]. A single species may have multiple dispersal patterns. The spacing and size of marine reserves must reflect this variability to maximize their beneficial effect. Species with shorter dispersal patterns are more likely to be affected by local changes and require higher priority for conservation because of the separation of subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. P., M. Srinivasan, and G. R. Almany. 2007. Conservation of marine biodiversity. Oceanography 20: 100-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
The principles of marine larval ecology can be applied in other fields, too whether marine or not. Successful [[fisheries management]] relies heavily on understanding population connectivity and dispersal distances, which are driven by larvae. Dispersal and connectivity must also be considered when designing natural reserves. If populations are not self-recruiting, reserves may lose their species assemblages. Many invasive species can disperse over long distances, including the seeds of land plants and larvae of marine invasive species. Understanding the factors influencing their dispersal is key to controlling their spread and managing established populations.

'''Orestes Pursued by the Furies''' is an event from Greek mythology that is a recurring theme in art depicting [[Orestes]].

==Background==
In the [[The Iliad|''Iliad'']], the king of Argos, [[Agamemnon]], sacrifices his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to the Gods to assure good sailing weather to Troy. 
[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Orestes Pursued by the Furies - 1921.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
In  ''Agamemnon'', the first play of [[Aeschylus]]'s [[Oresteia]] trilogy, Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], and her lover, Aegisthus as revenge for sacrificing Iphigenia. In ''The Libation Bearers'', the second play of the Orestia, Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home to take revenge on his mother for murdering his father. 

Orestes ultimately does murder his mother, and afterward is tormented by [[Erinyes|The Furies]], beings who personify the anger of the dead.

==In Art==
Orestes being tormented by the Furies has been depicted by a number of artists.

'''''Ostforschung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔɔstˌfɔʁʃʊŋ|lang}}, "research on the east") is a [[German language|German]] term dating from the 18th century for the study of the areas to the east of [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|the core German-speaking region]].

Traditional ''Ostforschung'' has fallen into disrepute with modern German historians as it often reflected Western European [[Anti-Polish sentiment|prejudices of the time]] towards [[Poles]].&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;{{cite book |first=Karin |last=Friedrich |date=2006 |title=The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=5, 13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Ostforschung'' itself remained in use in the names of some journals and institutes throughout the [[Cold War]], but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s (e.g., the journal ''Zeitschrift für Ostforschung'', established in 1952, was renamed ''[[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]]'' in 1994).

Since the 1990s, ''Ostforschung'' itself has become a subject of historical research.

''Ostforschung'' was also the name of a multidisciplinary organization set up before [[World War II]] by Nazi German chief propagandist [[Albert Brackmann]] supporting Nazi genocidal policies, ethnic cleansing and anti-semitism. Brackmann and several other Nazi and nationalist historians and anthropologists co-ordinated Nazi German research on [[Eastern Europe]], mainly the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The research conducted by this organisation, as well as the [[Ahnenerbe]], was instrumental in planning of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] of local non-German populations in [[Generalplan Ost]].

The '''post-graduate diploma in management studies''', [[post-nominal letters]] '''DMS''', is a university management qualification in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Early structure===
The post-graduate qualification was originally accredited by the DMS Committee of the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|DES]]. It originally required either one year full-time or 3 years part-time study, and was arranged in two discrete sections: Part A and Part B. It was compulsory to pass the Part A examinations and assessment first before being allowed to take Part B. Part B consisted of the final examinations and a project dissertation. Overall the marks achieved in coursework, examinations and the final dissertation had to exceed a weighted threshold for the candidate to pass and be awarded a DMS. It was thus quite an intensive course with a large workload. If a candidate achieved 90% or above, they were awarded a Distinction.

===Entry requirements===
Normally a bachelor's degree or extensive managerial experience and/or other professional qualifications. Originally there was also a lower age limit for entry of 35 years old, but this requirement was subsequently dropped as managers above that age found that the qualification had no value in achieving employment or promotion above 35.

===Accreditation===
Initially in the UK the qualification was accredited by the DMS committee of the DES, and later by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). It was originally accepted by the [[Chartered Management Institute|BIM]] as its core qualification for admission as a full member. The BIM subsequently was renamed to the Institute of Management when combining with the Institute of Industrial Managers, and now has again been renamed to become the [[Chartered Management Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managers.org.uk CIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The assessment for the few DMS courses which are still run in the UK is now almost without any formal examinations being required to be passed. It is thus subjectively awarded on the basis of course performance only, according to the opinion of the academic staff responsible.

==Controversy==

It has been argued by some that the move away from mainly or wholly exam assessed courses has lessened the 'value of the qualification' however the change from exams to coursework, projects and assignments is fairly in keeping with most postgraduate UK qualifications, although some exams are normally required.

==Recognition==
The DMS is accepted by the CMI as part of the required qualification for [[chartered manager]].

'''Privately owned public space''' ('''POPS'''), or alternatively, '''privately owned public open spaces''' ('''POPOS'''), are terms used to describe a type of [[public space]] that, although [[Private property|privately owned]], is legally required to be open to the [[public]] under a city's [[zoning ordinance]] or other land-use law. The acronym POPOS is preferentially used over POPS on the west coast of the US. Both terms can be used to represent either a singular or plural space or spaces.  These spaces are usually the product of a deal between cities and private [[Real estate development|real estate developers]] in which cities grant valuable zoning concessions and developers provide in return privately owned public spaces in or near their buildings. Privately owned public spaces commonly include [[plaza]]s, arcades, small [[park]]s, and [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s.  Many cities worldwide, including [[Auckland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Open up hidden public places in Auckland towers |first=Dorie |last=Reeves |url= http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11702774 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seattle.gov/council/Licata/public_space.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seoul]], and [[Toronto]], have privately owned public spaces.  Some cities and advocacy groups have created websites about these spaces (see, for example, [http://apops.mas.org/ apops.mas.org]).

Although the term "privately owned public space" was popularized by Harvard professor Jerold S. Kayden through his 2000 book ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience'', written in collaboration with the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] and the [[Municipal Art Society of New York]], the history of privately owned public space commenced in 1961 when New York City introduced an incentive zoning mechanism offering developers the right to build 10 square feet of bonus rentable or sellable floor area in return for one square foot of plaza, and three square feet of bonus floor area in return for one square foot of arcade.&lt;ref&gt;Kayden, Jerold S., The New York City Department of City Planning, and The Municipal Art Society of New York. ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience''. New York: Wiley, 2000.   {{ISBN|978-0471362579}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 2000, 503 privately owned public spaces, scattered almost entirely in downtown, midtown, and upper east and west sides of New York City's borough of [[Manhattan]], were constructed at 320 buildings.  More spaces have been added since then.  The book cited the quantitative success of the program's public space production but reported that 41% of these spaces were of "marginal" quality and roughly 50% of buildings had one or more spaces apparently out of compliance with applicable legal requirements resulting in [[privatization]].

While "privately owned public space" as a term of art refers specifically to private property required to be usable by the public under zoning or similar regulatory arrangements, the phrase in its broadest sense can refer to places, like shopping malls and hotel lobbies, that are privately owned and open to the public, even if they are not legally required to be open to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Process art''' is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'' ([[work of art]]/[[found object]]), is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, patterning, and moreover the initiation of actions and proceedings.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing'' and how actions can be defined as an actual work of art; seeing the art as pure human expression. Process art often [[logical consequence|entails]] an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Movement==
Process art has been entitled as a creative movement in the US and Europe in the mid-1960s. It has roots in Performance Art, the [[Dada]] movement and, more traditionally, the drip paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]], and in its employment of [[serendipity]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, [[improvisation]], and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The ephemeral nature and insubstantiality of materials was often showcased and highlighted, as is demonstrated in this review of [[William Basinski]] and his work titled ''The Disintegration Loops I-IV'' by Joe Tangari for [[Pitchfork Media]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.

It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's ''Disintegration Loops'' are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, [[William Basinski]] set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music.

In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of processmusic I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/ (accessed: Saturday, February 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The process art movement and the [[environmental art]] movement are directly related:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists engage the primacy of organic systems, using perishable, insubstantial, and transitory materials such as dead rabbits, steam, fat, ice, cereal, sawdust, and grass. The materials are often left exposed to natural forces: gravity, time, weather, temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/movement?id=1037  (accessed:  Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In process art, as in the [[Arte Povera]] movement, nature itself is lauded as art; the symbolization and representation of nature, often rejected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Antecedent===
The process art movement has precedent in indigenous rites, shamanic and religious rituals, cultural forms such as [[sandpainting]], [[sun dance]], and the [[tea ceremony]] are fundamentally related pursuits.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Aspects of the process of the construction of a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sand [[mandala]] (a [[subset]] of sandpainting) of [[Medicine Buddha]] by monks from [[Namgyal Monastery]] in Ithaca, New York that began February 26, 2001 and concluded March 21, 2001 has been captured and web-exhibited&lt;ref&gt;Source:  http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/construction.htm (accessed: Monday, December 22, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; by the Ackland's Yager Gallery of Asian Art. The dissolution of the mandala was on June 8, 2001.

===Relationship to other disciplines and movements===
Process art shares fundamental features with a number of other fields, including the [[Expressive therapies | expressive therapies]] and [[Transformative arts| transformative arts]], both of which pivot around how the creative process of engaging in artistic activities can precipitate personal [[Introspection | insight]], individual healing, and [[Social change | social change]], independent of the perceived value attributed to the obejct of creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Additionally, process art is integral to [[Arts-based research| arts-based research]], which uses creative process and artistic expression to investigate subjects that resist description or representation through other modes of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, T. and Eisner, E., Arts Based Research. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: Sage, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McNiff, S., Art-Based Research. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic '''process control''' in [[Continuous production|continuous production processes]] is a combination of [[control engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] disciplines that uses [[industrial control system]]s  to achieve a production level of consistency, economy and safety which could not be achieved purely by human manual control. It is implemented widely in industries such as oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing and power generating  plants.

There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables a small number of operators to manage complex processes to a high degree of consistency. The development of large automatic process control systems was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.

The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand [[control loop]]s.

==History==
Early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices. Ktesibios of Alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the 3rd Century BC. In the 1st Century AD, Heron of Alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets.&lt;ref name="Young etal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=William Y|last2=Svrcek|first2=Donald P|last3=Mahoney|first3=Brent R|title=A Real Time Approach to Process Control|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1119993872|pages=1–2|edition=3|chapter=1: A Brief History of Control and Simulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles. In 1620, Cornlis Drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace. In 1681, Denis Papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt; In 1745, Edmund Lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency; a fantail was a smaller windmill placed 90° of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind.

With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes.  In 1784, Oliver Evans created a water-powered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors. Henry Ford applied the same theory in 1910 when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt;

For continuously variable process control it was not until 1922 that a formal control law for what we now call [[PID control]] or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

==Development of modern process control operations==
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

==Hierarchy==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation.]]
The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computer-based control.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors (process value readings - PV), and final control elements (FCE), such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

==Control model==

To determine the fundamental model for any process, the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Bequette"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bequette|first1=B. Wayne|title=Process control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0133536409|pages=57–58|edition=Prentice-Hall International series in the physical and chemical engineering science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs. The control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be.

*State Variable (x) - This is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system, such as temperature (energy balance), volume (mass balance) or concentration (component balance). 
*Input Variable (u) - This is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates. It's important to note that the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs. The control input can be classified as a manipulated, disturbance, or unmonitored variable.
*Parameters (p) - The parameters are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system, such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material.
*Output (y) - The output is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system. The control output can be classified as measured, unmeasured, or unmonitored.

==Types==
Processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms:

*Batch –  Some applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result.  One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).
*Continuous – Often, a physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time.  The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. Continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year (millions to billions of pounds). Such controls use [[feedback control|feedback]] such as in the [[PID controller]] A PID Controller includes proportional, integrating, and derivative controller functions.
*Hybrid - Applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called ''hybrid'' applications.

==Control loops==
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4-20 mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the [[control loop]], which controls just one process variable. An example is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a PID controller, assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servo-controller to ensure correct valve positioning.

Some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops. In complex processes the loops are interactive, so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another. The system diagram for representing control loops is a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]].

Commonly used controllers are [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC), [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS) or [[SCADA]].

[[File:Auxostat schematic.svg|thumb|Example of level control system of a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]. The flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control. ]]

A further example is shown. If a control valve were used to hold level in a tank, the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant. A cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position.

==Economic advantages==
The economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins. The competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory. These specifications can come in two forms: a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product, or a range within which the property must be.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=C L|title=Process Control for the Process Industries - Part 2: Steady State Characteristics|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress|date=March 2017|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; All loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications. This buffer comes at an economic cost (i.e. additional processing, maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions, etc.).

Process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; This can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process. The efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; Margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades (i.e. equipment upgrades, enhanced control methods, etc.). Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency.&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''.

Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

{{Business administration}}
'''Procurement''' is the process of finding, agreeing terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source, often via a tendering or competitive [[bidding]] process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services, or works at the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weele|first=Arjan J. van|title=Purchasing and Supply Chain Management: Analysis, Strategy, Planning and Practice|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Andover|isbn=978-1-4080-1896-5|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimizing risk, such as exposure to fraud and collusion.

Almost all purchasing decisions include factors such as delivery and handling, marginal benefit, and price fluctuations. Procurement generally involves making buying decisions under conditions of scarcity. If good data is available, it is good practice to make use of economic analysis methods such as cost-benefit analysis or cost-utility analysis.

==Overview==
An important distinction should be made between analyses without risk and those with risk. Where risk is involved, either in the costs or the benefits, the concept of best value should be employed.

Procurement activities are also often split into two distinct categories, direct and indirect spend. Direct spend refers to the production-related procurement that encompasses all items that are part of finished products, such as raw material, components and parts. Direct procurement, which is the focus in [[supply chain management]], directly affects the production process of manufacturing firms. In contrast, [[indirect procurement]] concerns non-production-related acquisition: obtaining “operating resources” which a company purchases to enable its operations. Indirect procurement comprises a wide variety of goods and services, from standardized items like office supplies and machine [[lubricants]] to complex and costly products and services like heavy equipment, consulting services, and [[outsourcing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.A. and Roehrich, J.K. (2009), Contracts, relationships and integration: Towards a model of the procurement of complex performance. ''International Journal of Procurement Management'', 2(2):125–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, N.D. Roehrich, J.K. and Davies, A.C. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

=== Procurement vs. sourcing vs. acquisition ===
Procurement is one component of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement is viewed as more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition are viewed as more strategic and encompassing.

The [[Institute of Supply Management]] (ISM) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|title=ISM - Supply Management Defined|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213182841/https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/content.cfm?ItemNumber=5558|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines strategic sourcing as the process of identifying sources that could provide needed products or services for the acquiring organization. The term procurement used to reflect the entire purchasing process or cycle, and not just the tactical components. ISM defines procurement as an organizational function that includes specifications development, value analysis, supplier market research, negotiation, buying activities, contract administration, inventory control, traffic, receiving and stores. Purchasing refers to the major function of an organization that is responsible for acquisition of required materials, services and equipment.

The United States [[Defense Acquisition University]] (DAU) defines procurement as the act of buying goods and services for the government.&lt;ref name="DAUP 09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|title=Glossary of Defense Acquisition Acronyms and Terms, 12th Edition (plus updates since publication), accessed on 22 April 2009, Defense Acquisition University|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404030824/http://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document|archivedate=4 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DAU defines acquisition as the conceptualization, initiation, design, development, test, contracting, production, deployment, Logistics Support (LS), modification, and disposal of weapons and other systems, supplies, or services (including construction) to satisfy [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] needs, intended for use in or in support of military missions.&lt;ref name = "DAUP 09"/&gt;

Acquisition and sourcing are therefore much wider concepts than procurement.

Multiple sourcing business models exist, and acquisition models exist.

===Acquisition process===
The revised acquisition process for major systems in industry and defense is shown in the next figure. The process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts, which are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field.&lt;ref name="DAUP 01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acquisition Process.jpg|center|thumb|560px|Model of the acquisition process&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;]]
The process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases. For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation, while a system based on mature and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or, conceivably, even production. The process itself includes four phases of development:&lt;ref name = "DAUP 01"/&gt;
* Concept and technology development is intended to explore alternative concepts based on assessments of operational needs, technology readiness, risk, and affordability.
* The concept and technology development phase begins with concept exploration. During this stage, concept studies are undertaken to define alternative concepts and to provide information about capability and risk that would permit an objective comparison of competing concepts.
* The system development and demonstration phase could be entered directly as a result of a technological opportunity and urgent user need, as well as having come through concept and technology development.
* The last, and longest phase is the sustainable and disposal phase of the program. During this phase all necessary activities are accomplished to maintain and sustain the system in the field in the most cost-effective manner possible.

===Sourcing business models===
Procurement officials increasingly realize that their make-buy supplier decisions fall along a continuum from simple buying transactions to more complex, strategic buyer-supplier collaborations. It is important for procurement officials to use the right sourcing business model that fits each buyer-seller situation. There are seven models along the sourcing continuum: basic provider, approved provider, preferred provider, performance-based/managed services model, [[Vested]] business model, [[shared services]] model and equity partnerships.
* A basic provider model is transaction-based; it usually has a set price for individual products and services for which there are a wide range of standard market options. Typically these products or services are readily available, with little differentiation in what is offered.
* An approved provider model uses a transaction-based approach where goods and services are purchased from prequalified suppliers that meet certain performance or other selection criteria. 
* The preferred provider model also uses a transaction-based economic model, but a key difference between the preferred provider and the other transaction-based models is that the buyer has chosen to move to a supplier relationship where there is an opportunity for the supplier to add incremental value to the buyer’s business to meet strategic objectives.
* A performance-based (or managed services model) is generally a formal, longer-term supplier agreement that combines a relational contracting model with an output-based economic model. It seeks to drive supplier accountability for output-based service-level agreements (SLAs) and/or cost reduction targets.
* A vested sourcing business model is a hybrid relationship that combines an outcome-based economic model with a relational contracting model. Companies enter into highly collaborative arrangements designed to create and share value for buyers and suppliers above and beyond.
* A shared services model is typically an internal organization based on an arm’s-length outsourcing arrangement. Using this approach, processes are often centralized into an SSO that charges business units or users for the services they use. 
* An equity partnership creates a legally binding entity; it can take different legal forms, from buying a supplier (an acquisition), to creating a subsidiary, to equity-sharing joint ventures or entering into cooperative (co-op) arrangements.

===Procurement software===
Procurement software (often labeled as [[e-procurement]] software) manages the purchasing processes electronically or via [[cloud computing]].

===Procurement life cycle===
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}Most of the organizations think of their procurement process in terms of a life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Different consulting firms and experts have developed various frameworks. Some of the most common steps from the most popular frameworks include:
* '''Identification of need and requirements analysis''' is an internal step that involves an understanding of business objectives by establishing a short term strategy (three to five years) for overall spend category followed by defining the technical direction and requirements.
* '''External macro-level market analysis''': Once an organization understands its requirements, it should look outward to assess the overall marketplace. A key part of a market analysis is understanding the overall competitiveness of the marketplace and trends that are likely to impact the organization.
*'''Cost analysis''' is the accumulation, examination and manipulation of cost data for comparisons and projections. A cost analysis is important to help an organization make a make-buy decision.
* '''Supplier identification''' includes identifying particular suppliers that can provide the required product or services. There are many sources to search for potential suppliers. One good source is trade shows. Modern procurement software often incorporates a supplier catalog for standardized goods and services.
* '''[[Non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA)''': It is quite normal to request vendors to sign an NDA prior to engaging with them. This protects the organisation where sensitive information is shared with multiple potential vendors ahead of releasing detailed requirements which often point to strategic decisions a firm has taken.
* '''Supplier communication:''' When one or more suitable suppliers have been identified, an organization will typically conduct a competitive [[bidding]] process. Organizations can use a variety of competitive bidding methods including [[requests for quotation]], [[Request for proposal|requests for proposals]], [[Request for information|requests for information]], [[Request for tender|requests for tender]], [[Request for Solution|request for solution]] or a request for partnership. Some institutions choose to use a [[notification service]] in order to raise the competition for the chosen opportunity. These systems can either be direct from their e-tendering software, or as a re-packaged notification from an external system. During this step direct contact may be made with the suppliers. References for product/service quality are consulted, and any requirements for follow-up services including installation, maintenance, and [[warranty]] are investigated. Samples of the product/service being considered may be examined, or trials undertaken. Organizations should do a risk assessment, [[total cost of ownership]] analysis and [[best value]] assessment before selecting the final suppliers/solution.
* '''Negotiations and contracting:''' [[Negotiation]]s are undertaken that often include price, availability, customization, and delivery schedules. The details are outlined in a [[purchase order]] or more formal [[contract]].
*'''Logistics and performance management:''' Supplier preparation, [[expediting]], shipment, delivery, and payment for the product/service are completed, based on contract terms. Installation and training may also be included. An organization should evaluate the performance of the product/service as they are consumed. A supplier scorecard is a popular tool for this purpose. When the product/service has been consumed or disposed of, the contract expires, or the product or service is to be re-ordered, the organization should review their experience with the product/service. If the product/service is to be re-ordered, the company determines whether to consider other suppliers or to continue with the same supplier.
* '''Supplier management and liaison:''' Organizations that have more strategic goods or services that require ongoing interfaces with a supplier will use a [[supplier relationship management]] process. Strategic [[outsourcing]] relationships should set up formal governance processes.

===Procurement performance===
The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply|Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply]] (CIPS) promotes a model of "five rights" which it claims are "a traditional formula expressing the basic objectives of procurement and the general criteria by which procurement performance is measured", namely that goods and services purchased should be of the right '''quality''', in the right '''quantity''', delivered to the right '''place''' at the right '''time''' and obtained at the right '''price'''.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; CIPS also offers an alternative listing of the five rights as "buy[ing] goods or services of the right quality, in the right quantity, from the right source, at the right time and at the right price.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS, [https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ Procurement Glossary - F] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081801/https://cips.org/knowledge/procurement-glossary/f/ |date=14 April 2017 }}, accessed 14 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardent Partners published a report in 2011 which presented a comprehensive, industry-wide view into what was happening in the world of procurement at that time by drawing on the experience, performance, and perspective of nearly 250 chief procurement officers and other procurement executives. The report includes the main procurement performance and operational benchmarks that procurement leaders use to gauge the success of their organizations. This report found that the average procurement department manages 60.6% of total enterprise spend. This measure commonly called "spend under management" refers to the percentage of total enterprise spend (which includes all direct and indirect spend) that a procurement organization manages or influences. The average procurement department also achieved an annual savings of 6.7% in the last reporting cycle, sourced 52.6% of its addressable spend, and has a contract compliance rate of 62.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=| url=http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| title=Ardent Partners Research - CPO 2011: Innovative Ideas for the Decade Ahead| access-date=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924045811/http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_12&amp;products_id=7| archivedate=24 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Finance ===
Procurement and Finance have, as functions within the corporate structure, been at loggerheads. The contentious nature of their relationship can perhaps be attributed to the history of procurement itself. Historically, Procurement has been considered Finance’s underling. One reason behind this perception can be ascribed to semantics. When Procurement was in its infancy, it was referred to as a “commercial” operation. And so the procurement department was referred to as the ''commercial'' department rather than the procurement department: the word “commercial” was understood to be associated with money. And so it was obvious that Procurement would become directly answerable to Finance. Another factor, equally grounded in semantics, was that procurement departments (or rather, commercial departments) were always seen as “spending the money.” This impression was enough to situate Procurement within the Finance function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|title=Here’s What Happened To This Company After Procurement Was Freed From Finance’s Control|date=2017-02-22|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224024031/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/02/22/procurement-freed-finances-control/|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It's easy to see why Procurement and Finance are functions with interests that are mutually irreconcilable. Whereas Procurement is fundamentally concerned with the spending or disbursal of money, Finance, by its very nature, performs a cost-cutting role. That is fundamentally the reason why Procurement's aspirations have been constantly checked by Finance's cost-cutting imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|title=Calling All CPOs: Here’s How You Can Stand Up To Your CFO|date=2017-01-25|website=Procurement Sense|access-date=2017-03-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211042430/http://blog.procurify.com/2017/01/25/cpo-stand-up-to-your-cfo/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion, however, has been changing as more chief procurement officers have begun to argue for more autonomy and less interference from Finance departments.

==Public procurement==
{{main article|Government procurement}}
Public procurement generally is an important sector of the economy. In Europe, public procurement accounts for 16.3% of the Community [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|title=Public contracts - Your Europe - Business|publisher=Europa.eu|access-date=16 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628072231/http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/profiting-from-eu-market/benefiting-from-public-contracts/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green public procurement===
In green public procurement (GPP), contracting authorities and [[entities]] take environmental issues into account when tendering for goods or services. The goal is to reduce the impact of the procurement on human health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |title=EC.Europa.eu |publisher=EC.Europa.eu |date= |access-date=16 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190556/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/glossary_en.htm |archivedate=25 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the Commission has adopted its communication on public procurement for a better environment, where proposes a political target of 50% Green public procurement to be reached by the Member States by the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm |title=EC.europa.eu |publisher=EC.europa.eu |date= |access-date=16 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110928041946/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessible procurement ===
The United States Section 508 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.section508.gov/|title=Section508.gov - GSA Government-wide Section 508 Accessibility Program|author=|date=|website=www.section508.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323122051/https://www.section508.gov/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European Commission standard EN 301 549 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard|title=Standard - EN 301 549  - Mandate 376|author=|date=|website=mandate376.standards.eu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616234249/http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard|archivedate=16 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; require public procurement to promote accessibility. This means buying products and technology that has accessibility features built in to promote access for the around 1 billion people worldwide who have disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/|title=World report on disability|author=|date=|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316124425/http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/|archivedate=16 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative competitive bidding procedures ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2016}}There are several alternatives to traditional competitive bid tendering that are available in formal procurement. One approach that has gained increasing momentum in the construction industry and among developing economies is the [[selection in planning]] (SIP) process, which enables project developers and equipment purchasers to make significant changes to their requirements with relative ease. The SIP process also enables vendors and contractors to respond with greater accuracy and competitiveness as a result of the generally longer lead times they are afforded. University of Tennessee research&lt;ref name="Tennessee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|last2=Kling|first2=Jeanne|last3=Keith|first3=Bonnie|last4=Handley|first4=David|title=Unpacking Collaborative Bidding|date=2016|publisher=HASLAM COLLEGE OF BUSINESS|location=Tennessee, USA|page=9|url=http://www.lindahl.se/media/1123954/unpacking_collaborative_bidding_march_6_3_.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428053108/http://www.lindahl.se/media/1123954/unpacking_collaborative_bidding_march_6_3_.pdf|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that [[Request for Solution]] and [[Request for association]] (also known as request for partner or request for partnership) methods are also gaining traction as viable alternatives and more collaborative methods for selecting strategic suppliers – especially for [[outsourcing]].

==Fraud==
Recognizing the negative impact of procurement fraud, OECD has published guidelines on how to detect and combat bid rigging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|title=Detecting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement – OECD Guidelines|first=|last=networkthoughts|date=6 July 2016|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012181516/https://procurement.tv/2016/07/06/detecting-bid-rigging-in-public-procurement-oecd-guidelines/|archivedate=12 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procurement fraud can be defined as dishonestly obtaining an advantage, avoiding an obligation or causing a loss to public property or various means during procurement process by public servants, contractors or any other person involved in the procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23998519M/Combating_Procurment_Frauds|title=Combating Procurement Frauds Author Dr Irfan Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]], whereby a dishonest agent of the supplier pays a dishonest agent of the purchaser to select the supplier's bid, often at an inflated price. Other frauds in procurement include:
* Collusion among bidders to reduce competition.
* Providing bidders with advance "inside" information.
* Submission of false or inflated invoices for services and products that are not delivered or work that is never done. "Shadow vendors", shell companies that are set up and used for billing, may be used in such schemes.
* Intentional substitution of substandard materials without the customer's agreement.
* Use of "sole source" contracts without proper justification.
* Use of prequalification standards in specifications to unnecessarily exclude otherwise qualified contractors.
* Dividing requirements to qualify for small-purchase procedures to avoid scrutiny for contract review procedures of larger purchases.

==History of the School==
[[File:Sir bernard lovell photo.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Bernard Lovell]] (1913-2012) is part of a long and distinguished history of Physics in Manchester going back to 1874.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;]]
The school has origins dating back to 1874 when [[Balfour Stewart]] was appointed the first [[Langworthy Professor]] of Physics at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College, Manchester]]. Stewart was the first to identify an electrified atmospheric layer (now known as the [[ionosphere]]) which could distort the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The theory of the ionosphere was postulated by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1839, Stewart published the first experimental confirmation of the theory in 1878.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Since then, the school has hosted many award-winning scientists&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; including:

'''Second-language acquisition''' ('''SLA'''), '''second-language learning''', or '''L2''' ('''language 2''') '''acquisition''', is the process by which people learn a [[second language]]. Second-language acquisition is also the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process. The field of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]], but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines, such as [[psychology]] and [[education]].

A central theme in SLA research is that of ''[[interlanguage]]'', the idea that the language that learners use is not simply the result of differences between the languages that they already know and the language that they are learning, but that it is a complete language system in its own right, with its own systematic rules. This interlanguage gradually develops as learners are exposed to the targeted language. The order in which learners acquire features of their new language stays remarkably constant, even for learners with different native languages, and regardless of whether they have had language instruction. However, languages that learners already know can have a significant influence on the process of learning a new one. This influence is known as ''[[language transfer]]''.

The primary factor driving SLA appears to be the language input that learners receive. Learners become more advanced the longer they are immersed in the language they are learning, and the more time they spend doing free voluntary reading. The [[input hypothesis]] developed by linguist [[Stephen Krashen]] makes a distinction between language acquisition and language learning (acquisition–learning distinction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|title=Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition (Assimilação Natural - o Construtivismo no Ensino de Línguas)|author=|date=|website=www.sk.com.br|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122150432/http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|archivedate=22 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that acquisition is a subconscious process, whereas learning is a conscious one. According to this hypothesis, the acquisition process in L2 (Language 2) is the same as L1 (Language 1) acquisition. The learning process is consciously learning and inputting the language being learned.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=100}} However, this goes as far as to state that input is all that is required for acquisition. Subsequent work, such as the [[interaction hypothesis]] and the [[comprehensible output hypothesis]], has suggested that opportunities for output and for interaction may also be necessary for learners to reach more advanced levels.

Research on how exactly learners acquire a new language spans a number of different areas. Focus is directed toward providing proof of whether basic linguistic skills are innate (nature), acquired (nurture), or a combination of the two attributes. Cognitive approaches to SLA research deal with the processes in the brain that underpin language acquisition, for example how paying attention to language affects the ability to learn it, or how language acquisition is related to short-term and long-term memory. Sociocultural approaches reject the notion that SLA is a purely psychological phenomenon, and attempt to explain it in a social context. Some key social factors that influence SLA are the level of immersion, connection to the L2 community, and gender. Linguistic approaches consider language separately from other kinds of knowledge, and attempt to use findings from the wider study of linguistics to explain SLA. There is also a considerable body of research about how SLA can be affected by individual factors such as age and learning strategies. A commonly discussed topic regarding age in SLA is the [[critical period hypothesis]], which suggests that individuals lose the ability to fully learn a language after a particular age in childhood. Another topic of interest in SLA is the differences between adult and child learners. Learning strategies are commonly categorized as learning or communicative strategies, and are developed to improve their respective acquisition skills. Affective factors are emotional factors that influence an individual's ability to learn a new language. Common affective factors that influence acquisition are anxiety, personality, social attitudes, and motivation.

Individuals may also lose a language through a process called [[second-language attrition]]. This is often caused by lack of use or exposure to a language over time. The severity of attrition depends on a variety of factors including level of [[Language proficiency|proficiency]], age, social factors, and motivation at the time of acquisition. Finally, classroom research deals with the effect that language instruction has on acquisition.

== Definitions ==
''Second language'' refers to any language learned in addition to a person's [[first language]]; although the concept is named ''second''-language acquisition, it can also incorporate the learning of third, fourth, or subsequent languages.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=7}} Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do; it does not refer to practices in [[language teaching]], although teaching can affect acquisition. The term ''acquisition'' was originally used to emphasize the non-conscious nature of the learning process,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Krashen|1982}} made a sharp distinction between ''learning'' and ''acquisition'', using ''learning'' to refer to the conscious aspects of the language learning process and ''acquisition'' to refer to the subconscious aspects. This strict separation of learning and acquisition is widely regarded as an oversimplification by researchers today, but his hypotheses were very influential and the name has stuck.&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years ''learning'' and ''acquisition'' have become largely synonymous.

SLA can incorporate [[heritage language learning]],{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=21–24}} but it does not usually incorporate [[bilingualism]]. Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language, not the process itself, and see the term as referring to native-like fluency. Writers in fields such as education and psychology, however, often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of [[multilingualism]].{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=24–25}} SLA is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a [[foreign language]]; rather, the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=3}}

== Research background ==
The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]]. It is broad-based and relatively new. As well as the various branches of [[linguistics]], second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology, [[cognitive psychology]], and education. To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself, the terms ''second-language acquisition research'', ''second-language studies'', and ''second-language acquisition studies'' are also used.

SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field, and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} However, two papers in particular are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: Pit Corder's 1967 essay ''The Significance of Learners' Errors'', and Larry Selinker's 1972 article ''Interlanguage''.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}} The field saw a great deal of development in the following decades.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} Since the 1980s, SLA has been studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, and theoretical perspectives. In the early 2000s, some research suggested an equivalence between the acquisition of human languages and that of computer languages (e.g. Java) by children in the 5 to 11 year age window, though this has not been widely accepted among educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Readin', Writin' &amp; Ruby On Rails: Let's Teach Our Kids To Code|last = Koerner|first = Brendan I.|date = October 2013|journal = Wired|doi = |pmid = |page = 30|author-link = Brendan I. Koerner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant approaches in the field today are: systemic functional linguistics, sociocultural theory, cognitive linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[universal grammar]], [[Skill-based theories of second-language acquisition|skill acquisition theory]] and [[connectionism]].{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned, and many issues are still unresolved. There are many theories of second-language acquisition, but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of SLA, this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. Although attempts have been made to provide a more unified account that tries to bridge first language acquisition and second language learning research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janciauskas|first=Marius|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2017-07-26|title=Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12519|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=42|pages=519–554|doi=10.1111/cogs.12519|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Stages ==
Stephen Krashen divides the process of second-language acquisition into five stages: preproduction, early production, speech emergence, intermediate fluency, and advanced fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|title=The Stages of Second Language Acquisition|first=|last=ASCD|date=|website=www.ascd.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328231719/http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|archivedate=28 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} The first stage, preproduction, is also known as the [[silent period]]. Learners at this stage have a receptive vocabulary of up to 500 words, but they do not yet speak their second language.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} Not all learners go through a silent period. Some learners start speaking straight away, although their output may consist of imitation rather than creative language use. Others may be required to speak from the start as part of a language course. For learners that do go through a silent period, it may last around three to six months.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=73–75}}

The second of Krashen's stages of acquisition is early production, during which learners are able to speak in short phrases of one or two words. They can also memorize chunks of language, although they may make mistakes when using them. Learners typically have both an active and receptive vocabulary of around 1000 words. This stage normally lasts for around six months.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

The third stage is speech emergence. Learners' vocabularies increase to around 3000 words during this stage, and they can communicate using simple questions and phrases. They may often make grammatical errors.

The fourth stage is intermediate fluency. At this stage, learners have a vocabulary of around 6000 words, and can use more complicated sentence structures. They are also able to share their thoughts and opinions. Learners may make frequent errors with more complicated sentence structures.

The final stage is advanced fluency, which is typically reached somewhere between five and ten years of learning the language. Learners at this stage can function at a level close to native speakers.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

Krashen has also developed a number of hypotheses discussing the nature of second language learners' thought processes and the development of self-awareness during second language acquisition. The most prominent of these hypotheses are Monitor Theory and the Affective Filter hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307232341/http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The time taken to reach a high level of proficiency can vary depending on the language learned. In the case of native English speakers, some estimates were provided by the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the [[U.S. Department of State]], which compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages for their professional staff (native English speakers who generally already know other languages). Of the 63 languages analyzed, the five most difficult languages to reach proficiency in speaking and reading, requiring 88 weeks (2200 class hours), are [[Arabic]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]]. The Foreign Service Institute and the [[National Virtual Translation Center]] both note that Japanese is typically more difficult to learn than other languages in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|title=What's the Hardest Language to Learn?|work=Zidbits|accessdate=10 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611010429/http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|archivedate=11 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons with first-language acquisition ==
Adults who learn a second language differ from children [[Language acquisition|learning their first language]] in at least three ways: children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds, and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking. Although some adult second-language learners reach very high levels of proficiency, pronunciation tends to be non-native. This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the [[critical period hypothesis]]. When a learner's speech plateaus, it is known as [[Interlanguage fossilization|fossilization]].

Some errors that second-language learners make in their speech originate in their first language. For example, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers learning [[English language|English]] may say "Is raining" rather than "It is raining", leaving out the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence. This kind of influence of the first language on the second is known as ''negative'' [[language transfer]]. [[French language|French]] speakers learning English, however, do not usually make the same mistake of leaving out "it" in "It is raining." This is because [[Pronoun|pronominal]] and impersonal sentence subjects [[Pro-drop language|can be omitted]] (or as in this case, are not used in the first place) in Spanish but not in French.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=13}} The French speaker knowing to use a pronominal sentence subject when speaking English is an example of ''positive'' language transfer. It is important to note that not all errors occur in the same ways; even two individuals with the same native language learning the same second language still have the potential to utilize different parts of their native language. Likewise, these same two individuals may develop near-native fluency in different forms of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Monika S. Schmid (2014) The Debate on Maturational Constraints in Bilingual Development: A Perspective from First-Language Attrition, Language Acquisition, 21:4, 386-410, DOI: 10.1080/10489223.2014.892947&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to the gestures the learner makes and the language features they tend to notice.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=232}} For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers.{{sfn|Flege|1987}} This kind of change in pronunciation has been found even at the onset of second-language acquisition; for example, English speakers pronounced the English /p t k/ sounds, as well as English vowels, differently after they began to learn Korean.{{sfn|Chang|2012}} These effects of the second language on the first led [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]] to propose the idea of [[multi-competence]], which sees the different languages a person speaks not as separate systems, but as related systems in their mind.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=15}}

== Learner language ==
''Learner language'' is the written or spoken language produced by a learner. It is also the main type of data used in second-language acquisition research.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=4}} Much research in second-language acquisition is concerned with the internal representations of a language in the mind of the learner, and in how those representations change over time. It is not yet possible to inspect these representations directly with brain scans or similar techniques, so SLA researchers are forced to make inferences about these rules from learners' speech or writing.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=6}}

=== Interlanguage ===
{{main article|Interlanguage}}

Originally, attempts to describe learner language were based on [[Contrastive analysis|comparing different languages]] and on [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analyzing learners' errors]]. However, these approaches weren't able to predict all the errors that learners made when in the process of learning a second language. For example, Serbo-Croat speakers learning English may say "What does Pat doing now?", although this is not a valid sentence in either language.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | title=Didactics&amp;nbsp;– 7 : Critique of Krashen III. Natural Order Hypothesis (2) :Interlanguage | accessdate=2011-02-10 | author=Mason, Timothy | work=Lecture in the didactics of English, Université of Versailles St. Quentin, a course run from 1993 to 2002 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110125249/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | archivedate=2012-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain this kind of systematic error, the idea of the ''interlanguage'' was developed.{{sfn|Selinker|1972}} An interlanguage is an emerging language system in the mind of a second-language learner. A learner's interlanguage is not a deficient version of the language being learned filled with random errors, nor is it a language purely based on errors introduced from the learner's first language. Rather, it is a language in its own right, with its own systematic rules.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}} It is possible to view most aspects of language from an interlanguage perspective, including [[grammar]], [[phonology]], [[lexicon]], and [[pragmatics]].

There are three different processes that influence the creation of interlanguages:&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;
* ''[[Language transfer]]''. Learners fall back on their mother tongue to help create their language system. Transfer can be positive, i.e. promote learning, or negative, i.e. lead to mistakes. In the latter case, linguists also use the term interference error.
* ''Overgeneralization''. Learners use rules from the second language in roughly the same way that children overgeneralise in their first language. For example, a learner may say "I goed home", overgeneralizing the English rule of adding ''-ed'' to create past tense verb forms. English children also produce forms like goed, sticked, bringed. German children equally overextend regular past tense forms to irregular forms.
* ''Simplification''. Learners use a highly simplified form of language, similar to speech by children or in [[pidgin]]s. This may be related to [[linguistic universal]]s.

The concept of interlanguage has become very widespread in SLA research, and is often a basic assumption made by researchers.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}}

|}
{{main article|Order of acquisition}}
In the 1970s, several studies investigated the order in which learners acquired different grammatical structures.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These studies were based on work by {{Harvtxt|Brown|1973}} on child first-language acquisition. The first such studies on child second-language acquisition were carried out by {{Harvs|txt|last=Dulay|last2=Burt|year=1973|year2=1974a|year3=1974b|year4=1975}}. {{Harvtxt|Bailey|Madden|Krashen|1974}} investigated the order of acquisition among adult second-language learners. See {{Harvtxt|Krashen|1977}} for a review of these studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies showed that there was little change in this order among learners with different first languages. Furthermore, it showed that the order was the same for adults and children, and that it did not even change if the learner had language lessons. This supported the idea that there were factors other than language transfer involved in learning second languages, and was a strong confirmation of the concept of interlanguage.

However, the studies did not find that the orders were exactly the same. Although there were remarkable similarities in the order in which all learners learned second-language grammar, there were still some differences among individuals and among learners with different first languages. It is also difficult to tell when exactly a grammatical structure has been learned, as learners may use structures correctly in some situations but not in others. Thus it is more accurate to speak of ''sequences'' of acquisition, in which specific grammatical features in a language are acquired before or after certain others but the overall order of acquisition is less rigid.  For example, if neither feature B nor feature D can be acquired until feature A has been acquired and if feature C cannot be acquired until feature B has been acquired but if the acquisition of feature D does not require the possession of feature B (or, therefore, of feature C), then both acquisition order (A, B, C, D) and acquisition order (A, D, B, C) are possible.

=== Variability ===

Although second-language acquisition proceeds in discrete sequences, it does not progress from one step of a sequence to the next in an orderly fashion. There can be considerable variability in features of learners' interlanguage while progressing from one stage to the next.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} For example, in one study by Rod Ellis a learner used both "No look my card" and "Don't look my card" while playing a game of bingo.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}} A small fraction of variation in interlanguage is ''free variation'', when the learner uses two forms interchangeably. However, most variation is ''systemic variation'', variation that depends on the context of utterances the learner makes.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} Forms can vary depending on linguistic context, such as whether the subject of a sentence is a pronoun or a noun; they can vary depending on social context, such as using formal expressions with superiors and informal expressions with friends; and also, they can vary depending on psycholinguistic context, or in other words, on whether learners have the chance to plan what they are going to say.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} The causes of variability are a matter of great debate among SLA researchers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}}

== Language transfer ==
{{main article|Language transfer}}

One important difference between first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition is that the process of second-language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows. This influence is known as ''language transfer''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term ''language transfer'' is not without controversy, however. Sharwood Smith and Kellerman preferred the term ''[[crosslinguistic influence]]'' to ''language transfer''. They argued that ''cross-linguistic influence'' was neutral regarding different theories of language acquisition, whereas ''language transfer'' was not. {{harvnb|Sharwood Smith|Kellerman|1986}}, cited in {{harvnb|Ellis|2008|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Language transfer is a complex phenomenon resulting from interaction between learners’ prior linguistic knowledge, the target-language input they encounter, and their cognitive processes.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Language transfer is not always from the learner’s native language; it can also be from a second language, or a third.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Neither is it limited to any particular domain of language; language transfer can occur in grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, discourse, and reading.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=350}}

Language transfer often occurs when learners sense a similarity between a feature of a language they already know and a feature of the interlanguage they have developed. If this happens, the acquisition of more complicated language forms may be delayed in favor of simpler language forms that resemble those of the language the learner is familiar with.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Learners may also decline to use some language forms at all if they are perceived as being too distant from their first language.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}}

Language transfer has been the subject of several studies, and many aspects of it remain unexplained.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain language transfer, but there is no single widely accepted explanation of why it occurs.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=397}}

== Input and interaction ==

The primary factor affecting language acquisition appears to be the input that the learner receives. [[Stephen Krashen]] took a very strong position on the importance of input, asserting that [[comprehensible input]] is all that is necessary for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Krashen|1981a}}{{sfn|Krashen|1994}} Krashen pointed to studies showing that the length of time a person stays in a foreign country is closely linked with his level of language acquisition. Further evidence for input comes from studies on reading: large amounts of free voluntary reading have a significant positive effect on learners' vocabulary, grammar, and writing.{{sfn|Elley|1991}}{{sfn|Krashen|2004}} Input is also the mechanism by which people learn languages according to the [[universal grammar]] model.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=215}}

The type of input may also be important. One tenet of Krashen's theory is that input should not be grammatically sequenced. He claims that such sequencing, as found in language classrooms where lessons involve practicing a "structure of the day", is not necessary, and may even be harmful.{{sfn|Krashen|1981b|pp=54–55}}

While input is of vital importance, Krashen's assertion that ''only'' input matters in second-language acquisition has been contradicted by more recent research. For example, students enrolled in French-[[language immersion]] programs in Canada still produced non-native-like grammar when they spoke, even though they had years of meaning-focused lessons and their listening skills were statistically native-level.{{sfn|Swain|1991}} Output appears to play an important role, and among other things, can help provide learners with feedback, make them concentrate on the form of what they are saying, and help them to automatize their language knowledge.{{sfn|Skehan|1998}} These processes have been codified in the theory of [[comprehensible output]].{{sfn|Swain|1995}}

Researchers have also pointed to interaction in the second language as being important for acquisition. According to Long's [[interaction hypothesis]] the conditions for acquisition are especially good when interacting in the second language; specifically, conditions are good when a breakdown in communication occurs and learners must negotiate for meaning. The modifications to speech arising from interactions like this help make input more comprehensible, provide feedback to the learner, and push learners to modify their speech.{{sfn|Long|1996}}

== Cognitive factors ==

Much modern research in second-language acquisition has taken a cognitive approach.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Cognitive research is concerned with the mental processes involved in language acquisition, and how they can explain the nature of learners' language knowledge. This area of research is based in the more general area of [[cognitive science]], and uses many concepts and models used in more general cognitive theories of learning. As such, cognitive theories view second-language acquisition as a special case of more general learning mechanisms in the brain. This puts them in direct contrast with linguistic theories, which posit that language acquisition uses a unique process different from other types of learning.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}}

{{anchor|Computational models}}The dominant model in cognitive approaches to second-language acquisition, and indeed in all second-language acquisition research, is the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The computational model involves three stages. In the first stage, learners retain certain features of the language input in short-term memory. (This retained input is known as ''intake''.) Then, learners convert some of this intake into second-language knowledge, which is stored in long-term memory. Finally, learners use this second-language knowledge to produce spoken output.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=35}} Cognitive theories attempt to codify both the nature of the mental representations of intake and language knowledge, and the mental processes that underlie these stages.

In the early days of second-language acquisition research on [[interlanguage]] was seen as the basic representation of second-language knowledge; however, more recent research has taken a number of different approaches in characterizing the mental representation of language knowledge.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=408–410}} There are theories that hypothesize that learner language is inherently variable,{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=410–415}} and there is the functionalist perspective that sees acquisition of language as intimately tied to the function it provides.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=415–417}} Some researchers make the distinction between ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' language knowledge, and some between ''declarative'' and ''procedural'' language knowledge.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=242–243}} There have also been approaches that argue for a ''dual-mode system'' in which some language knowledge is stored as rules, and other language knowledge as items.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=431–433}}

The mental processes that underlie second-language acquisition can be broken down into micro-processes and macro-processes. Micro-processes include attention;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=248–249}} working memory;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=250–253}} integration and restructuring. Restructuring is the process by which learners change their interlanguage systems;{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=443–445}} and ''monitoring'' is the conscious attending of learners to their own language output.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=253–255}} Macro-processes include the distinction between intentional learning and incidental learning; and also the distinction between explicit and implicit learning.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–452}} Some of the notable cognitive theories of second-language acquisition include the [[nativization model]], the [[multidimensional model]] and [[processability]] theory, [[emergentist model]]s, the [[competition model]], and [[skill-acquisition theories]].{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–482}}

Other cognitive approaches have looked at learners' speech production, particularly learners' [[speech planning]] and [[communication strategies]]. Speech planning can have an effect on learners' spoken output, and research in this area has focused on how planning affects three aspects of speech: complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Of these three, planning effects on fluency has had the most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=488–492}} Communication strategies are conscious strategies that learners employ to get around any instances of communication breakdown they may experience. Their effect on second-language acquisition is unclear, with some researchers claiming they help it, and others claiming the opposite.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=511}}

== Sociocultural factors ==

From the early days of the discipline researchers have also acknowledged that social aspects play an important role.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=37}} There have been many different approaches to sociolinguistic study of second-language acquisition, and indeed, according to Rod Ellis, this plurality has meant that "sociolinguistic SLA is replete with a bewildering set of terms referring to the social aspects of L2 acquisition".{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=280–281}} Common to each of these approaches, however, is a rejection of language as a purely psychological phenomenon; instead, sociolinguistic research views the social context in which language is learned as essential for a proper understanding of the acquisition process.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=280–281}}

Ellis identifies three types of social structure that affect acquisition of second languages: sociolinguistic setting, specific social factors, and situational factors.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=281}} Sociolinguistic setting refers to the role of the second language in society, such as whether it is spoken by a majority or a minority of the population, whether its use is widespread or restricted to a few functional roles, or whether the society is predominantly bilingual or monolingual.{{sfn|Siegel|2003|p=178}} Ellis also includes the distinction of whether the second language is learned in a natural or an educational setting.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=288}} Specific social factors that can affect second-language acquisition include age, gender, social class, and ethnic identity, with ethnic identity being the one that has received most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=323}} Situational factors are those that vary between each social interaction. For example, a learner may use more polite language when talking to someone of higher social status, but more informal language when talking with friends.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=268–269}}

Immersion programs provide a sociolinguistic setting that facilitates second-language acquisition. Immersion programs are educational programs where children are instructed in an L2 language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Although the language of instruction is the L2 language, the curriculum parallels that of non-immersion programs and clear support exists in the L1 language, as the teachers are all bilingual. The goal of these programs is to develop a high level of proficiency in both the L1 and L2 languages. Students in immersion programs have been shown to have greater levels of proficiency in their second language than students who receive second language education only as a subject in school.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} This is especially true in terms of their receptive skills. Also, students who join immersion programs earlier generally have greater second-language proficiency than their peers who join later. However, students who join later have been shown to gain native-like proficiency. Although immersion students' receptive skills are especially strong, their productive skills may suffer if they spend the majority of their time listening to instruction only. Grammatical skills and the ability to have precise vocabulary are particular areas of struggle. It is argued that immersion is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of native-like proficiency in a second language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Opportunities to engage in sustained conversation, and assignments that encourage syntactical, as well as semantic development help develop the productive skills necessary for bilingual proficiency.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}}

A learner's sense of connection to their in-group, as well as to the community of the target language emphasize the influence of the sociolinguistic setting, as well as social factors within the second-language acquisition process. [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Theory]] argues that an important factor for second language acquisition is the learner's perceived identity in relation to the community of the language being learned, as well as how the community of the target language perceives the learner.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not a learner feels a sense of connection to the community or culture of the target language helps determine their social distance from the target culture. A smaller social distance is likely to encourage learners to acquire the second language, as their investment in the learning process is greater. Conversely, a greater social distance discourages attempts to acquire the target language. However, negative views not only come from the learner, but the community of the target language might feel greater social distance to the learner, limiting the learner's ability to learn the language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not bilingualism is valued by the culture or community of the learner is an important indicator for the motivation to learn a language.{{sfn|Vega|2008|pp=185–198}}

Gender, as a social factor, also influences SLA. Females have been found to have higher motivation and more positive attitudes than males for second-language acquisition. However, females are also more likely to present higher levels of anxiety, which may inhibit their ability to efficiently learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}}

There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition. Schumann's [[Acculturation Model]] proposes that learners' rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the "social distance" and the "psychological distance" between learners and the second-language community. In Schumann's model the social factors are most important, but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=326–327}} Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner's [[socio-educational model]], which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition. Gardner's model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA, arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individuals willingness to learn L2; furthermore, the goal of an individual to learn a L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture, in other words, part of a (the targeted language) mono-linguistic community. Factors, such as [[Motivation in second-language learning|''integrativeness'']] and ''attitudes towards the learning situation'' drive motivation. The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic, but non-linguistic, such that the learner has met the desired goal. Although there are many critics of Gardner's model, nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Critical Review on the Socio-educational Model of SLA|url = http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|journal = Theory and Practice in Language Studies|date = 2015-03-24|issn = 1799-2591|pages = 605–612|volume = 5|issue = 3|doi = 10.17507/tpls.0503.21|first = Masumeh|last = Taie|first2 = Asghar|last2 = Afshari|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120181053/http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|archivedate = 2015-11-20|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=330}} The [[inter-group model]] proposes "ethnolinguistic vitality" as a key construct for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=332}} [[Language socialization]] is an approach with the premise that "linguistic and cultural knowledge are ''constructed'' through each other",{{sfn|Watson-Gegeo|Nielsen|2003|p=157}} and saw increased attention after the year 2000.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=334}} Finally, Norton's theory of [[social identity (linguistics)|social identity]] is an attempt to codify the relationship between power, identity, and language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=336}}

=== Sociocultural approaches ===

A unique approach to SLA is Sociocultural theory. It was originally developed by [[Lev Vygotsky]] and his followers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=151–152}}  Central to Vygotsky's theory is the concept of a [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD). The ZPD notion states that social interaction with more advanced target language users allows one to learn language at a higher level than if they were to learn language independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Languages are Learned|last=Lightbown|first=Patsy|last2=Spada|first2=Nina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-442224-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocultural theory has a fundamentally different set of assumptions to approaches to second-language acquisition based on the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}} Furthermore, although it is closely affiliated with other social approaches, it is a theory of mind and not of general social explanations of language acquisition. According to Ellis, "It is important to recognize... that this paradigm, despite the label 'sociocultural' does not seek to explain how learners acquire the cultural values of the L2 but rather how knowledge of an L2 is internalized through experiences of a sociocultural nature."{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}}

== Linguistic factors ==

Linguistic approaches to explaining second-language acquisition spring from the wider study of linguistics. They differ from cognitive approaches and sociocultural approaches in that they consider language knowledge to be unique and distinct from any other type of knowledge.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The linguistic research tradition in second-language acquisition has developed in relative isolation from the cognitive and sociocultural research traditions, and as of 2010 the influence from the wider field of linguistics was still strong.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Two main strands of research can be identified in the linguistic tradition: approaches informed by [[universal grammar]], and typological approaches.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=557}}

[[Typological universals]] are principles that hold for all the world's languages. They are found empirically, by surveying different languages and deducing which aspects of them could be universal; these aspects are then checked against other languages to verify the findings. The [[interlanguage]]s of second-language learners have been shown to obey typological universals, and some researchers have suggested that typological universals may constrain interlanguage development.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}}

The theory of universal grammar was proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s, and has enjoyed considerable popularity in the field of linguistics. It focuses on describing the [[linguistic competence]] of an individual. He believed that children not only acquire language by learning descriptive rules of grammar; he claimed that children ''creatively'' play and form words as they learn language, creating meaning of these words, as opposed to the mechanism of memorizing language.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=99}} It consists of a set of ''principles'', which are universal and constant, and a set of ''parameters'', which can be set differently for different languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}} The "universals" in universal grammar differ from typological universals in that they are a mental construct derived by researchers, whereas typological universals are readily verifiable by data from world languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}} It is widely accepted among researchers in the universal grammar framework that all first-language learners have access to universal grammar; this is not the case for second-language learners, however, and much research in the context of second-language acquisition has focused on what level of access learners may have.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}}

Universal grammar theory can account for some of the observations of SLA research. For example, L2-users often display knowledge about their L2 that they have not been exposed to.{{sfn|VanPatten|Williams|2015|pp=36–37}} L2-users are often aware of ambiguous or ungrammatical L2 units that they have not learned from any external source, nor from their pre-existing L1 knowledge. This unsourced knowledge suggests the existence of a universal grammar.

== Individual variation ==
{{main article|Individual variation in second-language acquisition}}

There is considerable variation in the rate at which people learn second languages, and in the language level that they ultimately reach. Some learners learn quickly and reach a near-native level of competence, but others learn slowly and [[Interlanguage fossilization|get stuck]] at relatively early stages of acquisition, despite living in the country where the language is spoken for several years. The reason for this disparity was first addressed with the study of [[language learning aptitude]] in the 1950s, and later with the ''[[good language learner studies]]'' in the 1970s. More recently research has focused on a number of different factors that affect individuals' language learning, in particular strategy use, social and societal influences, personality, motivation, and anxiety. The relationship between age and the ability to learn languages has also been a subject of long-standing debate.

The issue of age was first addressed with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The critical period hypothesis was formulated for first-language acquisition by {{Harvtxt|Penfield|Roberts|1959}} and popularized by {{Harvtxt|Lenneberg|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The strict version of this hypothesis states that there is a cut-off age at about 12, after which learners lose the ability to fully learn a language. However, the exact age marking the end of the critical period is debated, and ranges from age 6 to 13, with many arguing that it is around the onset of puberty.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} This strict version has since been rejected for second-language acquisition, as some adult learners have been observed who reach native-like levels of pronunciation and general fluency. However, in general, adult learners of a second-language rarely achieve the native-like fluency that children display, despite often progressing faster in the initial stages. This has led to speculation that age is indirectly related to other, more central factors that affect language learning.

Children who acquire two languages from birth are called simultaneous bilinguals. In these cases, both languages are spoken to the children by their parents or caregivers and they grow up knowing the two languages. These children generally reach linguistic milestones at the same time as their monolingual peers.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} Children who do not learn two languages from infancy, but learn one language from birth, and another at some point during childhood, are referred to as sequential bilinguals. People often assume that a sequential bilingual's first language is their most proficient language, but this is not always the case. Over time and experience, a child's second language may become his or her strongest.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} This is especially likely to happen if a child's first language is a minority language spoken at home, and the child's second language is the majority language learned at school or in the community before the age of five. Proficiency for both simultaneous and sequential bilinguals is dependent upon the child's opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations in a variety of contexts.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}}

Often simultaneous bilinguals are more proficient in their languages than sequential bilinguals. One argument for this is that simultaneous bilinguals develop more distinct representations of their languages, especially with regards to [[phonological]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] levels of processing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lexical Processing and Second Language Acquisition|last = Tokowicz|first = Natasha|publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-87755-8|location = New York, NY|pages = 57–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would cause learners to have more differentiation between the languages, leading them to be able to recognize the subtle differences between the languages that less proficient learners would struggle to recognize. Learning a language earlier in life would help develop these distinct representations of language, as the learner's first language would be less established. Conversely, learning a language later in life would lead to more similar semantic representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although child learners more often acquire native-like proficiency, older child and adult learners often progress faster in the initial stages of learning.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Older child and adult learners are quicker at acquiring the initial grammar knowledge than child learners, however, with enough time and exposure to the language, children surpass their older peers. Once surpassed, older learners often display clear language deficiencies compared to child learners. This has been attributed to having a solid grasp on the first language or mother tongue they were first immersed into. Having this cognitive ability already developed can aid the process of learning a second language since there is a better understanding of how language works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning difficulties or learning English difficulties? Additional language acquisition: An update for paediatricians.|last = Clifford, Rhodes, &amp; Paxton|first = |date = 2014|journal = Journal of Paediatricians &amp; Child Health Vol. 50 Issue 3|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this same reason interaction with family and further development of the first language is encouraged along with positive reinforcement. The exact language deficiencies that occur past a certain age are not unanimously agreed upon. Some believe that only pronunciation is affected, while others believe other abilities are affected as well. However, some differences that are generally agreed upon include older learners having a noticeable accent, a smaller vocabulary, and making several linguistic errors.

One explanation for this difference in proficiency between older learners and younger learners involves [[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]. Universal Grammar is a debated theory that suggests that people have innate knowledge of universal linguistic principles that is present from birth.{{sfn|Long|2007}} These principles guide children as they learn a language, but its parameters vary from language to language.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}} The theory assumes that, while Universal Grammar remains into adulthood, the ability to reset the parameters set for each language is lost, making it more difficult to learn a new language proficiently.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Since adults have an already established native language, the language acquisition process is much different for them, than young learners. The rules and principles that guide the use of the learners' native language plays a role in the way the second language is developed.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}}

Some nonbiological explanations for second-language acquisition age differences include variations in social and psychological factors, such as motivation; the learner's linguistic environment; and the level of exposure. Even with less advantageous nonbiological influences, many child learners attain a greater level of proficiency than adult learners with more advantageous nonbiological influences.{{sfn|Long|2007}}

=== Strategies ===
Considerable attention has been paid to the strategies learners use to learn a second language. Strategies have been found to be of critical importance, so much so that ''strategic competence'' has been suggested as a major component of [[communicative competence]].{{sfn|Canale|Swain|1980}} Strategies are commonly divided into ''[[learning strategies]]'' and ''[[communicative strategies]]'', although there are other ways of categorizing them. Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning, such as [[mnemonic]]s or using a [[dictionary]]. Communicative strategies are strategies a learner uses to convey meaning even when he or she doesn't have access to the correct form, such as using [[pro-form]]s like ''thing'', or using non-verbal means such as [[gesture]]s. If learning strategies and communicative strategies are used properly language acquisition is successful. Some points to keep in mind while learning an additional language are: providing information that is of interest to the student, offering opportunities for the student to share their knowledge and teaching appropriate techniques for the uses of the learning resources available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Good practice for pupils learning English as an additional language: Lessons from effective literacy teachers in inner-city primary schools|last = Flynn|first = Naomi|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Early Childhood Literacy Vol.7 Issue2 p.184|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy may include intentional ways to acquire or improve official their second language skills. Adult immigrants and/or second language learners seeking to acquire a second language can engage in different activities to receive and share knowledge as well improve their learning; some of these include:

*incidental or informal learning (''media resources, family/friend interactions, work interactions'')
*purposeful learning (''self-study, taking language classes'')
*pursuing formal education  &lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affective factors ===
The learner's attitude to the learning process has also been identified as being critically important to second-language acquisition. [[Anxiety]] in language-learning situations has been almost unanimously shown to be detrimental to successful learning. Anxiety interferes with the mental processing of language because the demands of anxiety-related thoughts create competition for mental resources. This results in less available storage and energy for tasks required for language processing.{{sfn|Ashcraft|Kirk|2001}} Not only this, but anxiety is also usually accompanied by self-deprecating thoughts and fear of failure, which can be detrimental to an individual's ability to learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} Learning a new language provides a unique situation that may even produce a specific type of anxiety, called language anxiety, that affects the quality of acquisition.{{sfn|MacIntyre|Gardner|1991}} Also, anxiety may be detrimental for SLA because it can influence a learner's ability to attend to, concentrate on, and encode language information.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} It may affect speed and accuracy of learning. Further, the apprehension created as a result of anxiety inhibits the learner's ability to retrieve and produce the correct information.

A related factor, personality, has also received attention. There has been discussion about the effects of [[Extraversion and introversion|extravert]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|introvert]] personalities. Extraverted qualities may help learners seek out opportunities and people to assist with L2 learning, whereas introverts may find it more difficult to seek out such opportunities for interaction.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} However, it has also been suggested that, while extraverts might experience greater fluency, introverts are likely to make fewer linguistic errors. Further, while extraversion might be beneficial through its encouragement of learning autonomously, it may also present challenges as learners may find reflective and time-management skills to be difficult.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} However, one study has found that there were no significant differences between extraverts and introverts on the way they achieve success in a second language.{{sfn|Erton|2010}}

Other personality factors, such as [[conscientiousness]], [[agreeableness]], and [[Openness to experience|openness]] influence self-regulation, which helps L2 learners engage, process meaning, and adapt their thoughts, feelings, and actions to benefit the acquisition process.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} SLA research has shown conscientiousness to be associated with time-management skills, metacognition, analytic learning, and persistence; agreeableness to effort; and openness to elaborative learning, intelligence, and metacognition. Both genetics and the learner's environment impact the personality of the learner, either facilitating or hindering an individual's ability to learn.

Social attitudes such as gender roles and community views toward language learning have also proven critical. Language learning can be severely hampered by cultural attitudes, with a frequently cited example being the difficulty of [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] children in learning English{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Also, the [[Motivation in second-language learning|motivation]] of the individual learner is of vital importance to the success of language learning. Motivation is influenced by goal [[salience (language)|salience]], [[wikt:valence|valence]], and [[self-efficacy]].{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} In this context, goal salience is the importance of the L2 learner's goal, as well as how often the goal is pursued; valence is the value the L2 learner places on SLA, determined by desire to learn and attitudes about learning the L2; and self-efficacy is the learner's own belief that he or she is capable of achieving the linguistic goal.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Studies have consistently shown that ''intrinsic motivation'', or a genuine interest in the language itself, is more effective over the long term than ''extrinsic motivation'', as in learning a language for a reward such as high grades or praise. However, motivation is dynamic and, as a L2 learner's fluency develops, their extrinsic motivation may evolve to become more intrinsic.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learner motivation can develop through contact with the L2 community and culture, as learners often desire to communicate and identify with individuals in the L2 community. Further, a supportive learning environment facilitates motivation through the increase in self-confidence and autonomy.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learners in a supportive environment are more often willing to take on challenging tasks, thus encouraging L2 development.

== Attrition ==
{{main article|Second-language attrition}}

Attrition is the loss of proficiency in a language caused by a lack of exposure to or use of a language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} It is a natural part of the language experience as it exists within a dynamic environment.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} As the environment changes, the language adapts. One way it does this is by using L1 as a tool to navigate the periods of change associated with acquisition and attrition. A learner's L2 is not suddenly lost with disuse, but its communicative functions are slowly replaced by those of the L1.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Similar to second-language acquisition, second-language attrition occurs in stages. However, according to the regression hypothesis, the stages of attrition occur in reverse order of acquisition. With acquisition, receptive skills develop first, and then productive skills, and with attrition, productive skills are lost first, and then receptive skills.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Age, proficiency level, and social factors play a role in the way attrition occurs.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Most often younger children are quicker than adults to lose their L2 when it is left unused. However, if a child has established a high level of proficiency, it may take him or her several years to lose the language. Proficiency level seems to play the largest role in the extent of attrition. For very proficient individuals, there is a period of time where very little, if any, attrition is observed. For some, residual learning might even occur, which is the apparent improvement within the L2.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Within the first five years of language disuse, the total percentage of language knowledge lost is less for a proficient individual than for someone less proficient. A cognitive psychological explanation for this suggests that a higher level of proficiency involves the use of [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s, or mental representations for linguistic structures. Schemas involve deeper mental processes for mental retrieval that are resistant to attrition. As a result, information that is tied to this system is less likely to experience less extreme attrition than information that is not.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Finally, social factors may play an indirect role in attrition. In particular, motivation and attitude influence the process. Higher levels of motivation, and a positive attitude toward the language and the corresponding community may lessen attrition. This is likely due to the higher level of competence achieved in L2 when the learner is motivated and has a positive attitude.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

== Classroom second-language acquisition ==
{{main article|Second-language acquisition classroom research}}

While considerable SLA research has been devoted to language learning in a natural setting, there have also been efforts made to investigate second-language acquisition in the classroom. This kind of research has a significant overlap with [[language education]], and it is mainly concerned with the effect that instruction has on the learner. It also explores what teachers do, the classroom context, the dynamics of classroom communication. It is both qualitative and quantitative research.

The research has been wide-ranging. There have been attempts made to systematically measure the effectiveness of language teaching practices for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. This research has indicated that many traditional language-teaching techniques are extremely inefficient.{{sfn|Lightbown|1990}} cited in {{Harvnb|Ellis|1994}} It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency.  Rather, to become proficient in the second language, the learner must be given opportunities to use it for communicative purposes.{{sfn|Doughty|Williams|1998}}{{sfn|Ellis|2002}}

Another area of research has been on the effects of corrective feedback in assisting learners. This has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction, and the overall focus of the classroom, whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|1990}}{{sfn|Lyster|Ranta|1997}}{{sfn|Lyster|Mori|2006}} There is also considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms.{{sfn|Allwright|Hanks|2009}} As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students, they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development.{{sfn|Tarone|Swierzbin|2009}}

The '''Society for the History of Technology''', or '''SHOT''', is the primary professional society for historians of technology. SHOT was founded in 1958 in the United States, and it has since become an international society with members "from some thirty-five countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org "Home," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; SHOT owes its existence largely to the efforts of Professor [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1917-1995). SHOT co-founders include John B. Rae, [[Carl W. Condit]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]], and [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]. SHOT's flagship publication is the journal ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Kranzberg served as editor of ''Technology and Culture'' until 1981, and was succeeded as editor by Robert C. Post until 1995, and John M. Staudenmaier from 1996 until 2010. The current editor of ''Technology and Culture'' is Suzanne Moon at the University of Oklahoma. SHOT is an affiliate of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[American Historical Association]] and publishes a joint booklet series with the AHA, "Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture," under the co-editorship of [[Pamela O. Long]], Robert C. Post, and [[Asif Azam Siddiqi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org/publications/booklets.html "Historical Perspectives," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela O. Long is the recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant"]] for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/arts/macarthur-awards-go-to-21-diverse-fellows.html Felicia R. Lee, "MacArthur Awards Go to 21 Diverse Fellows," ''New York Times'', September 17, 2014,]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of technology was traditionally linked to economic history and history of science, but its interactions are now equally strong with environmental history, gender history, business history, and labor history. SHOT annually awards two book prizes, the Edelstein Prize and the [https://www.historyoftechnology.org/about-us/awards-prizes-and-grants/the-sally-hacker-prize/ Sally Hacker Prize], as well as the Kranzberg Dissertation Fellowship and the Brooke Hindle Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Its highest award is the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]]. Recipients of the medal include Kranzberg, Ferguson, Post, Staudenmaier, Bart Hacker, and Brooke Hindle. In 1968 Kranzberg was also instrumental in the founding of a sister society, the International Committee for the History of Technology ([[ICOHTEC]]) in 1968. The two societies complement each other.

The Society for the History of Technology is dedicated to the historical study of technology and its relations with politics, economic, labor, business, the environment, public policy, science, and the arts. The society now numbers around 1500 members, and holds its meeting at a non-North-American venue every third year. SHOT also sponsors smaller conferences focused on specialized topics, often jointly with other scholarly societies and organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5764">'''Spiritual self-schema therapy''', sometimes referred to as '''3-S Therapy''', was developed at Yale University School of Medicine by S. Kelly Avants, Ph.D., and Arthur Margolin, Ph.D. It is a therapy for addicted individuals who have contracted [[HIV]] or are at risk for contracting [[HIV]], whose goals are to reduce illicit drug use as well as drug- and sex-related risk behaviors.  In general, it aims to promote living a spiritual life aiding in their recovery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) development program for the treatment of addiction and HIV risk behavior|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual self-schema therapy has a non-theistic foundation based on Buddhist practices, which are very similar to contemporary cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates the client's spiritual beliefs, which do not need to be specifically or conventionally religious. &lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=3-S Theoretical Foundation|url=http://www.3-s.us/about/foundation/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  3-S therapy does not "convert" clients to Buddhism or any other spiritual or religious belief system, but always works within the client's pre-existing set of beliefs. 

==Self-schema==
The term [[self-schema]] describes a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically an individual has an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy is shown in the automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think "Who am I? How would somebody like that respond to this situation?" If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.

==3-S at Yale==
[[Yale School of Medicine]] has started a program called 3-S Thearpy, signifying '''S'''piritual '''S'''elf-'''S'''chema. Self-schemas can be helpful, but they can also be problematic. Stereotypes are an example. Additionally, people who believe that they are "bad, worthless, or unlovable" do significant amounts of mental damage to themselves. Yale School of Medicine's 3-S program promotes [[spirituality]] as a strong resource for coping with life's troubles. The goal of its program is to create a path to enhance one's spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation" /&gt;  The therapy manuals for 3-S Therapy, in English, as well as translated into Spanish and Russian, are available at the Yale University website: https://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx

There is a growing trend in attempting to integrate spiritual and religious beliefs into [[HIV]] prevention and addiction treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">The '''Vertifolia effect''' is a well documented phenomenon in the fields of [[plant breeding]] and [[plant pathology]]. It is characterized by the erosion of a crop’s [[horizontal resistance]] to disease during a breeding cycle due to the presence of strong [[vertical resistance]], characterized by the presence of [[R genes]]. This phenomenon was first described by J.E. Van der Plank in his 1963 book Plant Disease: Epidemics and Control.&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Plank observed that under artificial selection the potato variety Vertifolia had stronger vertical resistance to the potato late blight bacterium, ''Phytophthora infestans'', as measured by the presence of specific [[R genes]]. However, when the pathogen overcame these [[R genes]] Vertifolia exhibited a greater loss of [[horizontal resistance]] than varieties with fewer [[R genes]] and lower [[vertical resistance]].&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect suggests that when a pathogen evolves an [[avirulence gene]] to counteract a variety’s R gene, that variety will be more susceptible to the pathogen than other varieties.

The Vertifolia effect has important implications for the breeding of disease resistant crops.  To avoid it plant breeders may opt to cross in R genes or insert transgenes at the end of the breeding cycle to maintain levels of horizontal resistance during  early rounds of selection. It is also suggests that breeders should focus on enhancing [[horizontal resistance]] to avoid potential catastrophic crop losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Vrije Universiteit Brussel''' {{Audio|Nl-Vrije Universiteit Brussel.ogg|listen}} is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking university located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="HigherEducationRegister"&gt;The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is one of the five universities officially recognised by the [[Flemish Community|Flemish government]]. A [http://www.highereducation.be list] of all official institutes of higher education in [[Flanders]] is maintained by the Flemish government.&lt;/ref&gt; It has four campuses: Brussels Humanities, Science and Engineering Campus (in [[Ixelles]]), Brussels Health Campus (in [[Jette]]), Brussels Technology Campus (in [[Anderlecht]]) and Brussels Photonics Campus (in [[Gooik]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Campuses |url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/campuses |journal=vub.ac.be |date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The university's name is sometimes abbreviated by "VUB" or translated to "[[Free University of Brussels]]". However, it is an official policy of the university not to use translations of its name, because of possible confusion with another university that has the same translated name: the [[French Community of Belgium|French]]-speaking [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Université libre de Bruxelles]].

In fact, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel was formed by the splitting in 1970 of the same Université libre de Bruxelles, which was founded in 1834 by the Flemish-Brussels lawyer [[Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen]]. He wanted to establish a university [[wiktionary:independent|independent]] from state and church, where [[academic freedom]] would be prevalent.&lt;ref name="Witte1996"&gt;{{Cite book

Accordingly, the university is [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] — it is open to all students on the basis of equality regardless of their ideological, political, cultural or social background – and it is managed using democratic structures, which means that all members – from students to faculty – participate in the decision-making processes.&lt;ref name="Statutes"&gt;According to the statutes of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel: {{Cite journal

The university is organised into 8 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] that accomplish the three central missions of the university: education, research, and [[Public services|service]] to the community. The faculties cover a broad range of fields of knowledge including the [[natural science]]s, [[classics]], life sciences, [[social sciences]], [[humanities]], and engineering. The university provides bachelor, master, and doctoral education to about 8,000 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students.&lt;ref name="Activiteitenverslag 2012"&gt;Figures from the ''2011-2012 Yearly Report'' of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel: {{Cite journal

== History ==
{{main article|Free University of Brussels}}

=== Establishment of a university in Brussels ===
The history of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is closely linked with that of [[Belgium]] itself. At the time of the declaration of independence of Belgium in 1830, three state universities existed in the cities of [[Ghent]], [[Liège]] and [[Leuven]]. In Brussels, the capital of the newly established country, a university was lacking. A group of leading [[intellectual]]s in the fields of arts, science, and education – amongst whom [[Auguste Baron]] and the astronomer and mathematician [[Adolphe Quetelet]] — pointed out the advantages of a university to the new capital and country.&lt;ref name="Witte1996"/&gt; Initially, they sought for the establishment of a state university, but the Belgian government showed little enthusiasm due to the onerous financial burden of yet another state university.

In 1834, the Belgian [[episcopate]] decided to establish a Catholic university in [[Mechelen]] with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the Belgian government had the intent to close the state university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution.&lt;ref name="Lamberts1990"&gt;{{Cite book

 | isbn = 90-6186-418-6
 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberals in Belgium strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the [[Freemasonry|freemasonic]] lodge "Les Amis Philantropes", as had a large number of other intellectuals with enlightened ideas. Baron was able to convince [[Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen]], the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.&lt;ref name="Witte1996"/&gt;

After sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the Université libre de Bruxelles was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic room of the city hall of Brussels. After its establishment, the Université libre de Bruxelles faced difficult times, since it did receive no [[Subsidy|subsidies]] or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarized in a speech to [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]]: the principle of ''free inquiry'' and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious [[authority]].&lt;ref name="Witte1996"/&gt;

=== Splitting of the university ===
In the nineteenth century, courses at the Université libre de Bruxelles were taught exclusively in French, the language of the upper class in Belgium at that time. However, with the Dutch-speaking population asking for more rights in Belgium, some courses were already taught in Dutch at the Faculty of Law as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in Dutch.&lt;ref name="HistoryVrijeUniversiteitBrussel"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1969, the university was finally split in two sister institutions: the French-speaking Université libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This splitting became official by the law of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian parliament, by which the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Université libre de Bruxelles became two separate [[Juristic person|legal entities]].&lt;ref name="Law28May1970"&gt;{{cite web

== Organisation ==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution. The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community – including [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students.&lt;ref name="Statutes"/&gt; This system guarantees the democratic process of decision-making and the independence from state and outside organisations. Nevertheless, the university receives significant funding from the Flemish government, although less than other [[List of Belgian universities|Flemish universities]]. Other important funding sources are grants for research projects (mostly from [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[European Union|European]] funding agencies), scholarships of academic members, revenues from cooperation with industry, and [[Tuition|tuition fees]] to a lesser extent.

The main organisational structure of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is its division into [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]:&lt;ref name="VUB Faculties"&gt;See the {{cite web
 |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/faculties.html
 |title = Faculties of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel
 |accessdate = 15 August 2013
 |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Faculty of Law and Criminology
*Faculty of Social Sciences &amp; Solvay Business School
*Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences
*Faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences
*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy
*Faculty of Arts and Philosophy
*Faculty of Engineering
*Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy
These faculties benefit a wide [[autonomy]] over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university's statutes and must be approved by the central administration.

The [[Central Administration|central administration]] is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder. It decides the university's long-term vision and must approve all decisions made by the faculties. The Governing Board is supported by three advising bodies: the Research Council, the Education Council, and the Senate. These bodies provide advice to the Governing Board on all issues regarding research, education, and the academic excellence of faculty staff, and may also propose changes to the university’s strategy. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and three Vice-Rectors. The current Rector of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is Prof. Dr. Caroline Pauwels[4] &lt;ref name="VUB Organogram"&gt;See the {{cite web

== Education ==
{{see also|List of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel}}
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel offers [[Course (education)|courses]] in a large variety of modern disciplines: law, economics, [[social sciences]], management, [[psychology]], [[physical sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[medical sciences]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]], [[humanities]], engineering, [[physical education]]. About 12,000 students follow one of its [[List of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel|128 educational programmes]].&lt;ref name="EducationalProgrammes"&gt;According to the {{cite web
 |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/en/programmes
 |title = official list of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel
 |accessdate = 15 August 2013
 |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All programmes are taught in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but 59 are also taught in English. In agreement with the [[Bologna process]], the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system. It therefore issues four types of [[Academic degree|degrees]]: bachelor's, master's, master after master's, and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.

[[University and college admissions|Admission]] to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice. However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor's degree is required to subscribe to a master’s programme, and a master's degree is required to subscribe to a master after master’s or doctoral programme. An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government. Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.

The [[Academic term|academic year]] is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June. Students take [[Test (student assessment)|exams]] in January and June. Apart from the Christmas and Easter holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the summer vacations from July to September.

The university has implemented several [[quality control]] schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes. Each semester, all students [[Evaluation|evaluate]] the courses they have followed. All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees. Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the [[NVAO|Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie]], an independent accreditation organisation charged with the [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of higher education programmes in both [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="NVAO"&gt;Accreditation details can be consulted at {{cite web

== Basic principles ==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel considers itself an open-minded and tolerant university.&lt;ref name="Smaakmaker"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | year = 2012
 | title = Welcoming the World
 | publication-place = Brussels
 | publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel
 | url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/downloads/VUB_CorporateBrochure.pdf
 | accessdate = 2013-08-15
 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central principles are the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in particular the principle of ''free inquiry'' for the progress of humanity. The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion.&lt;ref name="Statutes"/&gt; The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes. The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the French [[mathematician]] and philosopher [[Henri Poincaré]]:
[[File:VUB schild2.png|right|225px|Seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]
{{quote
 |text= 
Thinking must never submit itself,&lt;br /&gt;
neither to a dogma,&lt;br /&gt;
nor to a party,&lt;br /&gt;
nor to a passion,&lt;br /&gt;
nor to an interest,&lt;br /&gt;
nor to a preconceived idea,&lt;br /&gt;
nor to anything whatsoever,&lt;br /&gt;
except to the facts themselves,&lt;br /&gt;
because for it to submit to anything else would be the end of its existence.
|sign=}}
This principle is also reflected in the university's [[motto]] ''Scientia vincere tenebras'', or ''Conquering darkness by science'', and in its seal. The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar's wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]]) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in the [[emblem]], referring to the struggle of the Protestant [[Geuzen]] and the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] against the oppressive Spanish rule and the [[Inquisition]] in the sixteenth century.

Another basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel – also incorporated in the university's statutes – is that the institution must be managed according to the model of democracy.&lt;ref name="Statutes"/&gt; Practically, this means that all members of the academic community — [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students – are represented in all governing bodies. In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management. This principle must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.

== Campus and facilities ==
[[File:VUB campus Etterbeek.JPG|thumb|[[Etterbeek]] campus]]
''Brussels Humanities, Sciences &amp; Engineering Campus''&lt;br&gt;
Most of the faculties are located on the [[Etterbeek]] campus (which is actually located on the territory of the neighbouring borough of [[Elsene]]). It is the livelier of the two campuses and consists almost entirely of concrete structures, most built in the 1970s. Some are decaying rapidly but at least one, the Rectoraat designed by [[Renaat Braem]], is heritage-listed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vub.ac.be/downloads/GebouwM-NL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Activities take place in numerous auditoriums and labs. In addition, there is a modern sports centre, a football pitch encircled by a running track, and a swimming pool. For eating out, there is a restaurant with subsidies for students and staff, and the bars/cafes 't Complex, Opinio, and KultuurKaffee. The {{Interlanguage link multi|KultuurKaffee|nl}} was a full-fledged concert venue during the evening/night, offering the university a cultural scene and organising free concerts and events. It was demolished to make space for the new XY construction project in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Renaat Braem Rectoraat VUB.JPG|thumbnail|right|Rectoraat, VUB]]

''Brussels Health Campus''&lt;br&gt;
The campus in [[Jette]] is also a fully-fledged campus. The University Hospital ({{Interlanguage link multi|UZ Brussel|nl}}) is in the vicinity. All courses and research in the [[life sciences]] (medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, the biomedical and paramedical sciences) are located here.

''Brussels Technology Campus''&lt;br&gt;
The campus Kaai in [[Anderlecht]] was established in 2013 and shared with the [[Erasmushogeschool Brussel]]. It houses the Industrial Engineering section of the Faculty of Engineering. Among extensive industrial laboratory facilities, the Brussels fablab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fablab-brussels.be|title=Fablab Brussels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown to the centre of activity on the campus in recent years.

==Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology==
[[File:Vubep.jpg|thumbnail]]

The Heart Rhythm Management Centre started its activities at the University Hospital UZ Brussel during spring 2007. The clinical activities soon rocketed to the #1 position in Belgium, and has been paralleled by important scientific production. Emerging fields of activity are multidisciplinary (clinical) and translational (research) programs in collaboration with the departments of Genetics, Pediatrics, Neonatology, Geriatrics, Neurology, as well as a fundamental research program in Physiology. 
The large scope of clinical activities, fuelled by increasing patient demand in Belgium and elsewhere, together with the presence of a state-of-the-art infrastructure and a research-stimulating multidisciplinary academic environment unique in Europe, as well as the intrinsic qualities of Professor Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada and his team, are a unique opportunity for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to implement this academic training program.

This Postgraduate course in Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing - is offered within the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy - after a specialization in Cardiology, and is supported by the Institute for Postgraduate Training of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (iPAVUB). The core faculty for the Postgraduate program includes Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada, who directs the EP fellowship training and the Cardiovascular Department, Prof. Dr. Carlo de Asmundis, Director of the Heart rhythm Management Centre, Prof. Dr. Gian Battista Chierchia, Director of Atrial Fibrillation Program, Prof. Dr. Marc La Meir and Prof. Dr. Francis Wellens, Director of Cardiac Surgery Service. Additional faculty who participate in the program includes: Prof. Dr. Bonduelle Mary-Louise and Prof. Dr. Ramon Brugada, who trains fellows in cardiac genetics, Prof. Dr. Joel Smets, University of Nijmegen, Nederland, who trains fellows in electrocardiography and basic electrophysiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/study/cardiac-electrophysiology-and-pacing|title=Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing|publisher=vub.ac.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
[[File:Penne CM.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''klak'' or ''penne'']]

Every student that enrolls at the VUB, automatically becomes a member of the Brussels Studentengenootschap (BSG – ''Brussels Student Society''), unless they refuse to be. This means that every student has the right to vote and participate in the annual elections for the BSG committee. The BSG is the umbrella organisation for all other student organizations and acts as the defender of the moral interests of the students. Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]], they organise the annual [[St V]] memorial.

These are some of the student organizations at the VUB:
*Studiekring vrij onderzoek: a collective of students from various faculties, promoting free inquiry through the organisation of debates, lectures and more
*Letteren-en Wijsbegeertekring (LWK) and Perskring (Pers): for students studying at the Arts and Philosophy faculty
*Geneeskundige Kring (GK) and Farmaceutische Kring (FK): for students studying at the Medicine and Pharmacy faculty
*Polytechnische Kring (PK) for students studying at the Engineering faculty
*Psycho-Pedagogische Kring (PPK): for students studying at the Psychology and Educational Sciences faculty
*Kring der Politieke Economische en Sociale Wetenschappen (KEPS) and Solvay ($); for students studying at the Economics, Political and Social Sciences faculty
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Wetenschappelijke Kring (WK)|nl}}: for students studying at the faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences
*Mens Sana in Corpore Sano (Mesacosa or MC): for students studying at the Physical Education and Physiotherapy faculty
*Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (VRG): for students studying at the Law and Criminology faculty

Members of these organizations wear a ''[[Student cap|klak]]'' (Dutch) or ''penne'' (French).

Furthermore, the VUB has student organizations for students with a specific regional background. They are: Antverpia ([[Antwerp]]), Westland ([[West Flanders]]), WUK ([[West Flanders]]), KBS ([[Brussels]] and [[Flemish Brabant]]), Campina ([[Campine]]), Kinneke Baba ([[East Flanders]]), Limburgia ([[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]), VSKM ([[Mechelen]]) and Hesbania ([[Haspengouw]]). There are also several organizations for specific majors within a faculty, such as Infogroep (computer science), Biotecho (bio-engineering), bru:tecture (previously Pantheon) (architecture) and Promeco (economics). Last but not least there are organizations centered around a common interest, such as the Society of Weird And Mad People (SWAMP, for all kinds of games) and BierKultuur (based on the rich beer culture in Belgium).
