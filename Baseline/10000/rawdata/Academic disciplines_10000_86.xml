[[File:Vesalius-copy.jpg|thumb|One of the large, detailed illustrations in [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' 16th century, marking the rebirth of anatomy|245x245px]]
'''Anatomy''' (Greek anatomē, "dissection") is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booktionary.com.ng/index_files/Page1935.htm|title=Anatomy|last=Rotimi|first=Booktionary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is inherently tied to [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[phylogeny]],&lt;ref name="intro HGray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, "Anatomy of the Human Body". Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Anatomy and [[physiology]], which study (respectively) the structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of [[multidisciplinary approach|related disciplines]], and they are often studied together. [[Human body|Human anatomy]] is one of the essential [[basic sciences]] that are [[Applied science|applied]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Arráez-Aybar et al. (2010). Relevance of human anatomy in daily clinical practice. Annals of Anatomy-Anatomischer Anzeiger, 192(6), 341–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy is divided into [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic anatomy]]. Macroscopic anatomy, or [[gross anatomy]], is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided [[eyesight]]. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of [[superficial anatomy]]. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of various structures, known as [[histology]], and also in the study of [[cell biology|cells]].

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and [[cadaver]]s (corpses) to 20th century [[medical imaging]] techniques including [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]].

Derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατομή}} ''anatomē'' "dissection" (from {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω}} ''anatémnō'' "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά ''aná'' "up", and τέμνω ''témnō'' "I cut"),&lt;ref&gt;O.D.E. 2nd edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt; anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of [[organism]]s including their systems, organs and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]], the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |editor-last=Bozman |editor-first=E. F.|year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes [[superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of an organism in its immature condition).&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt;

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt; Methods used include [[dissection]], in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] using [[X-ray]]s or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] are methods to visualize blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Use of Angiography to Outline the Cardiovascular Anatomy of the Sand Crab Portunus pelagicus Linnaeus |vauthors=Gribble N, Reynolds K | journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology | year=1993 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=627–637 | doi=10.1163/193724093x00192 | jstor=1549093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Characterization of the Renal Portal System of the Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) by Digital Subtraction Imaging |vauthors=Benson KG, Forrest L | journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine | year=1999 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=235–241|pmid=10484138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/magnetic_resonance_angiography_mra_135,14/ |title=Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angiography/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Angiography | publisher=National Health Service | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term ''zootomy'' is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].&lt;ref name=Everyman/&gt;

== Animal tissues ==
[[File:Anima cell notext.svg|right|thumb|Stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell (with flagella)]]
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains [[multicellular organism]]s that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are also known as [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings; the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the [[sponge]]s, which have undifferentiated cells.&lt;ref name=Dorit549&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=547–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[plant cell]]s, [[animal cells]] have neither a cell wall nor [[chloroplast]]s. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s and [[skin]]. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic [[germ layer]]s. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called [[diploblasty|diploblastic]] and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called [[triploblasty|triploblastic]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert60&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=59–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue]].
[[File:Cartilage polarised.jpg|thumb|Hyaline cartilage at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]

===Connective tissue===
[[Connective tissue]]s are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, [[adipose tissue]], fibrous connective tissue, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]]. The extracellular matrix contains [[protein]]s, the chief and most abundant of which is [[collagen]]. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a [[skeleton]] to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by [[mineralisation (biology)|mineralization]], as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in [[insect]]s. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt;

===Epithelium===
[[File:Normal gastric mucosa low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Gastric mucosa at low magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Epithelial tissue]] is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], the upper layer of the [[basement membrane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the [[respiratory tract]] there is a type of [[pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium|ciliated]] epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are [[Microvillus|microvilli]] on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are [[Intestinal villus|intestinal villi]]. [[Skin]] consists of an outer layer of [[keratin]]ized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. [[Keratinocyte]]s make up to 95% of the cells in the [[epidermis (skin)|skin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). Rook's Textbook of Dermatology (7th ed.). Blackwell Publishing. pp. 3.1–3.6. {{ISBN|978-0-632-06429-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a [[cuticle]]. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt; In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle tissue===
[[File:Skeletal muscle - cross section, nerve bundle.jpg|right|thumb|Cross section through [[skeletal muscle]] and a small [[nerve]] at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. [[Muscle tissue]] functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three main types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]. Smooth muscle has no [[Striated muscle tissue|striations]] when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as [[sea anemone]] tentacles and the body wall of [[sea cucumber]]s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.&lt;ref name=Ruppert103&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the [[uterus]], [[bladder]], [[intestines]], [[stomach]], o[[esophagus]], [[respiratory airways]], and [[blood vessel]]s. [[Cardiac muscle]] is found only in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

===Nervous tissue===
[[Nervous tissue]] is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In some slow-moving [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a [[nerve net]], but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along [[biological neural network|neural networks]] to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in [[Ganglion|ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert104&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and a [[peripheral nervous system]]. The latter consists of [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] that transmit information from sense organs and [[Motor neuron|motor nerves]] that influence target organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grey's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied |year=1944 |edition=28 |page=1038 |publisher=Langmans |editor1-last=Johnston | editor1-first= T.B |editor2-last=Whillis | editor2-first=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruppert107&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system is divided into the [[somatic nervous system]] which conveys sensation and controls [[voluntary muscle]], and the [[autonomic nervous system]] which involuntarily controls [[smooth muscle]], certain glands and internal organs, including the [[stomach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.inkling.com/read/essential-clinical-anatomy-keith-moore-4th/introduction-to-clinical-anatomy/nervous-system | title=Essesntial Clinical Anatomy | publisher=Inkling | work=Nervous System | date=2010 |edition=4th | accessdate=30 April 2014 |author1=Moore, K. |author2=Agur, A. |author3=Dalley, A. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
{{see also|Comparative anatomy}}
[[File:VolRenderShearWarp.gif|thumb|upright|[[Mouse]] skull]]
All [[vertebrate]]s have a similar basic [[body plan]] and at some point in their lives, mostly in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic]] stage, share the major [[chordate]] characteristics; a stiffening rod, the [[notochord]]; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the [[neural tube]]; [[pharyngeal arch]]es; and a tail posterior to the anus. The [[spinal cord]] is protected by the [[vertebral column]] and is above the notochord and the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] is below it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston |isbn=978-0-03-058446-6 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the [[vertebral column]], formed in the development of the segmented series of [[vertebra]]e. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the [[nucleus pulposus]] of the [[intervertebral disc]]s. However, a few vertebrates, such as the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]] retain the notochord into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|author2=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by [[Charles Darwin]] to support his theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/evolution/science/what-is-homology |title=What is Homology? |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:Internal anatomy of a fish (cutaway diagram).jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish]]
The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in [[cartilaginous fish]], or bone in [[bony fish]]. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.&lt;ref name=Dorit818/&gt; The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428001536/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.&lt;ref name=Dorit818&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=816–818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[Fish scale#Placoid scales|placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.&lt;ref name=Kotpal&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R. L. |year=2010 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |isbn=978-81-7133-891-7 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC&amp;pg=PA199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.&lt;ref name=Kotpal/&gt;

[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|upright|Plastic model of a frog]]
[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and [[metabolic waste#nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste products]] are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of [[buccal pumping]], a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

=== Reptile anatomy ===
{{main|Reptile anatomy}}
[[File:Crotalus atrox -Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA-29Aug2012.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of a [[diamondback rattlesnake]]]]
'''[[Reptile]]s''' are a class of animals comprising [[turtle]]s, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and [[crocodile]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[lizard]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their [[lung]]s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name=Dorit865&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=861–865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turtles''' are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.&lt;ref name=Dorit868&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=865–868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuataras''' superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Lizards''' have skulls with only one [[Skull#Fenestrae|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Snakes''' are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name=Dorit870&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crocodilians''' are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:Duerer wing of a blue roller.jpg|thumb|Part of a wing. [[Albrecht Dürer]], c.&amp;nbsp;1500–1512]]
Birds are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.&lt;ref name=Dorit895&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=881–895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.&lt;ref name=Dorit895/&gt;

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[Mammal]]s are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.&lt;ref name=Dorit914&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=909–914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.&lt;ref name=Dorit914/&gt;

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a [[human head|head]], [[neck]], [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] (which includes the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]), two [[arm]]s and [[hand]]s, and two [[human leg|legs]] and [[foot|feet]].

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.&lt;ref name=AAA/&gt;

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
[[File:Chirocephalus diaphanus male head.png|thumb|Head of a male ''[[Daphnia]]'', a [[planktonic]] crustacean]]
[[Invertebrate]]s constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' to such complex multicellular animals as the [[octopus]], [[lobster]] and [[dragonfly]]. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

[[Marcello Malpighi]], the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.&lt;ref name="ArberAgnes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arber, Agnes|title= Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694): an essay in comparison|journal= Isis |volume =34|issue=1| pages =7–16|jstor=225992|doi=10.1086/347742|year= 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthropod]]s comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insect]]s possess [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the [[exoskeleton]], made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.

[[Spider]]s a class of [[arachnid]]s have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a [[cephalothorax]] and an [[abdomen]]. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called [[chelicerae]] which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called [[pedipalp]]s attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the [[palpal bulb|copulatory organ]].

In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptian]] [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world.  Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The [[Hellenistic Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]] was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the [[Ptolemy]] rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.&lt;ref name=Longrigg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longrigg|first1=James|title=Anatomy in Alexandria in the Third Century B.C|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=December 1988|volume=21|issue=4|pages=455–488|jstor=4026964|doi=10.1017/s000708740002536x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid".&lt;ref name=Boas&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 |origyear=first published by Collins, 1962 | pages=120–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120–121}} Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists [[Mondino de Luzzi]], [[Alessandro Achillini]] and [[Antonio Benivieni]] at [[Bologna]] carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.&lt;ref name="ZimmermanVeith1993"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Zimmerman | first1=Leo M. | last2=Veith | first2=Ilza | title=Great Ideas in the History of Surgery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABbCI7z4UwMC | date=1 August 1993 | publisher=Norman | isbn=978-0-930405-53-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crombie1959"&gt;{{cite book | last=Crombie | first=Alistair Cameron | title=The History of Science From Augustine to Galileo | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA4 | year=1959 | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | isbn=978-0-486-28850-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorndike1958"&gt;{{cite book | last=Thorndike | first=Lynn | title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science: Fourteenth and fifteenth centuries| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbvlQFj4YfUC&amp;pg=PA586 | year=1958 | publisher=Columbia University Press | isbn=978-0-231-08797-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondino's ''Anatomy'' of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt; He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.&lt;ref name=Boas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Stephen F. | title=A History of the Sciences | publisher=Collier | year=1962 | location = New York | page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the [[University of Padua]], is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_material_from/ | title=Warwick honorary professor explores new material from founder of modern human anatomy | work=Press release | publisher= University of Warwick | accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Vesalius published the influential book ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Vesalius, Andreas. ''De humani corporis fabrica libri septem''. Basileae [Basel]: ''Ex officina'' Joannis Oporini, 1543.&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in [[allegory|allegorical]] poses against Italianate landscapes, are thought to have been made by the artist [[Jan van Calcar]], a pupil of [[Titian]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, C.D. ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514–1564''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were given by the [[Barber surgeon|Company of Barbers and Surgeons]] in the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the [[Royal College of Physicians]].&lt;ref name=Boas229&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 |origyear=first published by Collins, 1962 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.&lt;ref name=trafficdead&gt;{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-05925-X |url=https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.&lt;ref name="Rosner, Lisa. 2010"&gt;Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

Forbes]] of [[Jefferson Medical College]] was found guilty in 1882 of "complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefferson.edu/about/eakins/forbes.html |title=Reproduction of Portrait of Professor William S.

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].&lt;ref name=pmid1717373426&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Laing MR, Hutchison JD | title = Nineteenth century medical education for tomorrow's doctors | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–49 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17373426 | doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15712576"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Hutchison JD | title = Sir John Struthers MD FRCS Edin LLD Glasg: Anatomist, zoologist and pioneer in medical education | journal = The Surgeon : Journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 347–351 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15712576 | doi=10.1016/s1479-666x(04)80035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.&lt;ref name="McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53"&gt;McLachlan, J. &amp; Patten, D. 2006.

He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534198/Ignaz-Philipp-Semmelweis |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis |work=Encyclopædia Britannica  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemens-electron-microscope.jpg|upright|right|thumb|An electron microscope from 1973]]
Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were [[dissection]] of the dead and [[inspection]], [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] of the living. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of [[histology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] began in the late 19th century&lt;ref name=BritMicro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of [[biopsy]] specimens. The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].&lt;ref name=BritMicro/&gt;
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - III medicina, 1691 – BEIC 13350590.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1691]]
Equally important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and [[anaerobic digestion]], rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter.

Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of [[biomass]]  (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.

Biofuels are in theory [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because the carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants is equal to the carbon dioxide that is released when the fuel is burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/print.php?page=biomass_environment Biomass and the Environment – Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, whether or not a biofuel is carbon-neutral also depends greatly on whether the land which is used to grow the biofuel (with 1st and 2nd generation biofuel) [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|needed to be cleared of carbon-holding vegetation]] or not.

[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009,&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport. Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for about 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905003859/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-05 |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |access-date=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/biofuels_roadmap.pdf |year= 2011 |title=Technology Roadmap, Biofuels for Transport }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of biofuels also led into a flourishing automotive industry, where by 2010, 79% of all cars produced in Brazil were made with a hybrid fuel system of bioethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Jeremy | last2 = Matos | first2 = Stelvia | last3 = Silvestre | first3 = Bruno | last4 = Martin | first4 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Managing Technological and Social Uncertainties of Innovation: The Evolution of Brazilian Energy and Agriculture | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 78 | issue = 7| pages = 1147–1157 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various social, economic, environmental and technical [[issues relating to biofuels]] production and use, which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals.

==Generations==
===First-generation biofuels===
"First-generation" or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation, food crops are thus [[Food vs fuel|explicitly grown for fuel production]], and not anything else. The sugar, starch, or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using [[transesterification]], or yeast fermentation.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521143237/http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/05/18/3g-4g-a-taxonomy-for-far-out-%E2%80%94-but-not-far-away-%E2%80%94-biofuels/ First, second, third and fourth generation biofuels explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Second-generation biofuels}}
Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of [[biomass]].  Biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the [[carbon cycle]]. Biomass is derived from plant materials, but can also include animal materials.

Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in arable crops, second generation biofuels are made from [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste plant material (from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose).&lt;ref&gt;An example here is [[rapeseed]], of which the oil is used as waste fuel, and of which the actual produce (for which the crop is grown) is [[fodder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coconut oil]] is another example, if it is extracted in such a way that the meat and milk can still be used for human and/or animal consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/12/24/barley-grain-can-be-used-to-produce-ethanol-says-scientists-with-usda/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.315.5818.1488 |pmid=17363642 |title=CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: Biofuel Researchers Prepare to Reap a New Harvest |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5818 |pages=1488–1491 |year=2007 |last1=Service |first1=R. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jksus.2017.07.005 |title=Bioconversion of corn straw to ethanol by cellulolytic yeasts immobilized in Mucuna urens matrix |journal=Journal of King Saud University - Science |year=2017 |last1=Adelabu |first1=Blessing Adebola |last2=Kareem |first2=Sarafadeen Olateju |last3=Oluwafemi |first3=Flora |last4=Abideen Adeogun |first4=Idowu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on [[arable land]]s, but are just byproducts of the actual harvest (main crop) or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops&lt;ref&gt;i.e. arid lands in case of jatropha, or hilly terrain not accessible by tractor, ... in case of grasses, woody crops ...&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non-human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses, jatropha and other seed crops, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biofuel.org.uk/second-generation-biofuels.html|title=Biofuels - Second Generation Biofuels|website=biofuel.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that, unlike with regular food crops, no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops, it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance, a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/en8076765 |title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels |journal=Energies |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=6765–6794 |year=2015 |last1=Ramirez |first1=Jerome |last2=Brown |first2=Richard |last3=Rainey |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The potential and challenges of drop-in fuels (members only) {{!}} IEA Bioenergy Task 39 – Commercializing Liquid Biofuels|url = http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/?p=932|website = task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-generation biofuels===
{{Main|Algaculture|Algae fuel}}
From 1978 to 1996, the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|US NREL]] experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the "[[Aquatic Species Program]]".&lt;ref name = "NREL biofuels algae"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheehan|first=John|title=A Look Back at the U. S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biofuels from Algae|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=July 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the [[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] Biofuels Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all [[motor vehicle|vehicular]] fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants.&lt;ref name="Briggs2004"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html| title = Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae| first = Michael |last=Briggs|date=August 2004| accessdate = 2007-01-02

The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture&amp;nbsp;– unlike [[agriculture|crop-based]] biofuels&amp;nbsp;– does not entail a decrease in [[food production]], since it requires neither [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] nor [[fresh water]]. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |title=Valcent Products Inc. Develops "Clean Green" Vertical Bio-Reactor |accessdate=2008-07-09 |publisher=[[Valcent Products]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618163304/http://www.valcent.net/t/news_detailf62c.html?id=36 |archivedate=18 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfuelonline.com/technology.htm |title=Technology: High Yield Carbon Recycling |accessdate=2008-07-09 |publisher=[[GreenFuel Technologies Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821112329/http://www.greenfuelonline.com/technology.htm |archivedate=21 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. [[Rodrigo E. Teixeira]] from the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in [[ionic liquids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Energy-efficient extraction of fuel and chemical feedstocks from algae |journal = [[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 419–427 | author = R. E. Teixeira | doi = 10.1039/C2GC16225C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth-generation biofuels===
Similarly to third-generation biofuels, fourth-generation biofuels are made using non-arable land. However, unlike third-generation biofuels, they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes [[electrofuel]]s&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and [[Solar fuel|photobiological solar fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4678123 | pmid=26667057 | doi=10.1007/s13280-015-0730-0 | volume=45 Suppl 1 | title=From first generation biofuels to advanced solar biofuels | journal=Ambio | pages=S24–31 | last1 = Aro | first1 = EM| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fuels are [[Carbon-neutral fuel#Production|carbon-neutral]].

==Types==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogas===

[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.&lt;ref&gt;"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&amp;nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[File:Bushlulacana09032007.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] looks at sugar cane, a source of biofuel, with Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] during a tour on biofuel technology at [[Petrobras]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, 9 March 2007.]]
[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi - E.ON&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires&lt;ref&gt;Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,&lt;ref&gt;see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"&lt;/ref&gt; the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1 million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

With current subsidies, ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns of [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] that the economic viability is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], compared to today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned "straight" in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butanol.com/ |title=ButylFuel, LLC Main Page |publisher=Butanol.com |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. [[DuPont]] and [[BP]] are working together to help develop butanol. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their [[protein metabolism|amino acid metabolism]].&lt;ref name="butanol"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biofpr.com/details/feature/102347/Biofuels_aim_higher.html|title=Biofuels aim higher|last=Evans|first=Jon|date=14 January 2008 |work=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining (BioFPR)|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2018.08.004 |pmid=30107263 |title=Directed strain evolution restructures metabolism for 1-butanol production in minimal media |journal=Metabolic Engineering |volume=49 |pages=153–163 |year=2018 |last1=Pontrelli |first1=Sammy |last2=Fricke |first2=Riley C.B. |last3=Sakurai |first3=Sana Subhan Memon |last4=Putri |first4=Sastia Prama |last5=Fitz-Gibbon |first5=Sorel |last6=Chung |first6=Matthew |last7=Wu |first7=Hsin-Yi |last8=Chen |first8=Yu-Ju |last9=Pellegrini |first9=Matteo |last10=Fukusaki |first10=Eiichiro |last11=Liao |first11=James C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiesel ===

{{Main|Biodiesel}}
{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}
[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100&lt;!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) --&gt;. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the [[combustion]] of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2012/T46.pdf Nylund.N-O &amp; Koponen.K. 2013. Fuel and Technology Alternatives for Buses. Overall Energy Efficiency and Emission Performance. IEA Bioenergy Task 46]. Possibly the new emission standards Euro VI/EPA 10 will lead to reduced NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-levels also when using B100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and [[biodegradable]], and has a high [[flash point]] of about 300&amp;nbsp;°F (148&amp;nbsp;°C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125&amp;nbsp;°F (52&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, more than 80% of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005. "By the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold [from 2004] to more than" {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070606084122/http://www.wfs.org/futcontja07.htm THE FUTURIST], [http://www.prleap.com/pr/80099/ Will Thurmond]. July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.&lt;ref name=RA29&gt;{{Harvsp|Avril Group : Activity Report|2014|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avril Group]] produces under the brand [[Diester]], a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="EurObserv’ER"&gt;{{Harvsp|EurObserv’ER|2014|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the leading European producer of biodiesel.&lt;ref name=RA29/&gt;

===Straight vegetable oil===

[[File:Used vegetable cooking oil.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Filtered waste vegetable oil]]
[[File:Walmart’s Grease Fuel Truck (2).jpg|thumb|right|This truck is one of 15 based at Walmart's [[Buckeye, Arizona]] distribution center that was converted to run on a biofuel made from reclaimed cooking grease produced during food preparation at Walmart stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wal-Mart To Test Hybrid Trucks | publisher = Sustainable Business | date = February 3, 2009 | url = https://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/17599}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, G.

===Bioethers===

Bioethers (also referred to as fuel [[ethers]] or [[oxygenated fuel]]s) are cost-effective [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that act as [[octane rating]] enhancers."Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rock|first=Kerry|title=Bioethers Impact on the Gasoline Pool|url=http://www.digitalrefining.com/article/1000210,Bioethers_impact_on_the_gasoline_pool.html|publisher=Digital Refining|accessdate=15 February 2014|author2=Maurice Korpelshoek|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethers are created by wheat or sugar beet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuel.org.uk/bioethers.html Biofuels - Types of Biofuels - Bioethers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  They also enhance [[engine]] performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and [[toxic]] [[exhaust gas|exhaust emissions]].

When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), [[diethyl ether]] (DEE), methyl teritiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl ''ter''-butyl ether (ETBE), t''er''-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ''ter''-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sukla |first=Mirtunjay Kumar |title=Bio-Ethers as Transportation Fuel: A Review |url=http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/DMEoverview.pdf |publisher=Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun |accessdate=15 February 2014 |author2=Thallada Bhaskar |author3=A.K.

===Solid biomass fuels ===

Examples include [[wood]], [[sawdust]], [[grass]] trimmings, [[domestic waste|domestic refuse]], [[charcoal]], [[agricultural waste]], nonfood [[energy crop]]s, and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried manure]].

When solid biomass is already in a suitable form (such as [[firewood]]), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from {{convert|1|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}}, which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce [[wood pellet]]s, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with a broad range of input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.

Sawdust, bark and chips are already used for decades for fuel in industrial processes; examples include the pulp and paper industry and the sugar cane industry. Boilers in the range of 500,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hr of steam, and larger, are in routine operation, using grate, spreader stoker, suspension burning and fluid bed combustion. Utilities generate power, typically in the range of 5 to 50 MW, using locally available fuel. Other industries have also installed wood waste fueled boilers and dryers in areas with low-cost fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. McGowan, Michael L. Brown, William S. Bulpitt, James L. Walsh, Jr. (Editors) 2009. Biomass and Alternate Fuel Systems: An Engineering and Economic Guide. {{ISBN|978-0-470-41028-8}} Wiley, 280 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the advantages of solid biomass fuel is that it is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal husbandry and forestry.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

A problem with the combustion of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of [[pollutant]]s, such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. Even modern pellet boilers generate much more pollutants than oil or natural gas boilers. Pellets made from agricultural residues are usually worse than wood pellets, producing much larger emissions of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[chlorophenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briens | first1 = Cedric | last2 = Piskorz | first2 = Jan | last3 = Berruti | first3 = Franco | year = 2008 | title = Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering | volume = 6 | issue = | page = R2 | doi=10.2202/1542-6580.1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derived fuel is [[biochar]], which is produced by biomass [[pyrolysis]]. Biochar made from agricultural waste can substitute for wood charcoal. As wood stock becomes scarce, this alternative is gaining ground. In eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for example, [[biomass briquettes]] are being marketed as an alternative to charcoal to protect [[Virunga National Park]] from [[deforestation]] associated with [[charcoal]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |title=Threat to Great Apes Highlighted at Virunga Meeting |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828133830/http://www.america.gov/st/env-english/2008/July/20080711150646mlenuhret0.9135401.html |archivedate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution==
{{main|Biomass#Environmental damage|Ethanol_fuel#Air_pollution}}

Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to [[air pollution]]. Burning produces [[carbon dioxide]], airborne carbon [[particulate]]s, [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas [[chromatograph]] studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240399720_Atmospheric_alcohols_and_aldehydes_concentrations_measured_in_Osaka_Japan_and_in_Sao_Paulo_Brazil Atmospheric alcohols and aldehydes concentrations measured in Osaka, Japan and in São Paulo, Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio-ethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio-ethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil, which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming, as it is also an ozone destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haerens|first1=Margaret|title=Biofuels|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7377-5553-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates regarding the production and use of biofuel==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}
There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[food prices]], [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[energy ratio]], [[energy requirements]],  [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], loss of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fletcher Jr.|first=Robert J.|author2=Bruce A Robertson |author3=Jason Evans |author4=Patrick J Doran |author5=Janaki RR Alavalapati |author6=Douglas W Schemske |title=Biodiversity conservation in the era of biofuels: risks and opportunities|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|pages=161–168|url=http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24366|accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1890/090091|hdl=10919/24366}}&lt;/ref&gt; impact on [[water resources]], the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cotton |first=Charles A.

It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle.

Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by congress for 2010 was pushed back to at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol (not blended with a fossil fuel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bracmort|first=Kelsi|title=Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Mandate for Cellulosic Biofuels:Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41106.pdf|publisher=Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of first-generation biofuels===
In the EU, the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first-generation biofuels by 2030. Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/04/palm-oil-biofuels-meps-eu-transport-deforestation-zsl-greenpeace-golden-agri-resources-oxfam MEPs vote to ban the use of palm oil in biofuels ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-heading-for-zero-palm-oil-in-transport-by-2021/ EU heading for ‘zero palm oil’ in transport by 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-climatechange-palmoil/eu-to-phase-out-palm-oil-from-transport-fuel-by-2030-idUSKBN1JA21F EU to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable biofuels===
{{main|Sustainable biofuels}}
Many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 (using the first-generation biofuel production procedure) have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning chemist [[Paul J. Crutzen]] published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2008, the challenge was to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represented an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008).

Now, biofuels in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials are entering the market, driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions, and also by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]].

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1238 |title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change |last = Searchinger |first = Timothy |author2=Ralph Heimlich |author3=R.A.

However, no-till practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title =Biofuels, Land Use Change, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Some Unexplored Variables|last = Kim |first = Hyungtae|author2=Seungdo Kim|author3=Bruce E.

A study conducted in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 53-105 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while losing 48-90 Mg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be sequestered from forest depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alves Finco | first1 = Marcus V. | last2 = Doppler | first2 = Werner | year = 2010 | title = Bioenergy and Sustainable Development: The Dilemma of Food Security and Climate Change in the Brazilian Savannah | url = | journal = Energy for Sustainable Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 194–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.esd.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Runge | first1 = Ford | last2 = Senauer | first2 = Benjamin | year = 2007 | title = How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 41–53 | jstor=20032348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt.&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1235.short |title =Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt|last = fargione| first = Joseph|author2=Jason Hill |author3=David Tilman |author4=Stephen Polasky |author5=Peter Hawthorne |doi = 10.1126/science.1152747 |pmid =18258862|year=2008|accessdate = 12 November 2011 |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Use===
In addition to crop growth requiring water, biofuel facilities require significant process water.&lt;ref name="WaterI"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 18 June 2015 |journal=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and Carbon Sequestration===
Scientific research (20th century) shows that carbon dioxide emissions from all forms of surface transport are converted in a few weeks by forests, farms and oceans into biomass. This implies that a greater emphasis on sustainable forestry is very relevant for climate protection and sustainable, energy-efficient transport.

==Current research==
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet current US heating and transportation needs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in [[crop rotation]] with cereals, and have the added benefit that the meal left over after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf |title=Mustard Hybrids for Low-Cost Biofuels and Organic Pesticides |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174434/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the primary source of biofuels in North America, many organizations are conducting research in the area of [[ethanol]] production. The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) is a research division of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] dedicated solely to ethanol-based biofuel research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ethanol Research |url=http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |title=National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) |publisher=Ethanol Research |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320192458/http://www.ethanolresearch.com/ethanolresearch/about.shtml |archivedate=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel. Companies, such as [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], are building refineries that can process [[biomass]] and turn it into [[bioethanol]]. Companies, such as [[Diversa]], [[Novozymes]], and [[Dyadic International|Dyadic]], are producing enzymes that could enable a [[cellulosic ethanol]] future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.&lt;ref&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the first commercial-scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale, and their relative performance, will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |year=2013 |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail, [[sweet sorghum]] is being investigated as a potential source of food, feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions, as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In [[India]], and other places, sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |title=Sweet Sorghum : A New "Smart Biofuel Crop" |date=30 June 2008 |publisher=Agriculture Business Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new-smart-biofuel-crop/ |archivedate=27 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SG Biofuels]], a San Diego-based jatropha developer, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first-generation varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Digest |url=http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/05/16/jatropha-blooms-again-sg-biofuels-secures-250k-acres-for-hybrids|title=Jatropha blooms again: SG Biofuels secures 250K acres for hybrids |publisher=Biofuels Digest |date=2011-05-16 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; SG Biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and increased cold-weather tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SG Biofuels|url=http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226073111/http://www.sgfuel.com/pages/hybrid-seeds-and-services/jMax-hybrid-seeds.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2011|title=Jmax Hybrid Seeds|publisher=SG Biofuels|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2012-03-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant Research International, a department of the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plant Research International |url=http://www.pri.wur.nl/UK/research/plant-based_raw_materials/jatropha/JATROPT |title=JATROPT (Jatropha curcas): Applied and technical research into plant properties |publisher=Plant Research International |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300% in the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biofuels Magazine |url=http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727140520/http://www.biofuelsmagazine.com/articles/7743/energy-farming-methods-mature-improve|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-27|title=Energy Farming Methods Mature, Improve |publisher=Biofuels Magazine |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
A group at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]], in a 2008 paper, stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species, ''[[Cunninghamella]]'' ''[[Cunninghamella japonica|japonica]]'', and others, is likely to appear in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Sergeeva | first1 = Y. E.| last2 = Galanina | first2 = L. A.| last3 = Andrianova | first3 = D. A.| last4 = Feofilova | first4 = E.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus ''[[Gliocladium roseum]]'' (later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides) points toward the production of so-called [[myco-diesel]] from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern [[Patagonia]], and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strobel | first1 = G.| last2 = Knighton | first2 = B.| last3 = Kluck | first3 = K.| last4 = Ren | first4 = Y.| last5 = Livinghouse | first5 = T.| last6 = Griffin | first6 = M.| last7 = Spakowicz | first7 = D.| last8 = Sears | first8 = J.| title = The production of myco-diesel hydrocarbons and their derivatives by the endophytic fungus Gliocladium roseum (NRRL 50072)| journal = Microbiology| volume = 154| issue = Pt 11| pages = 3319–3328| year = 2008| pmid = 18957585| doi = 10.1099/mic.0.2008/022186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms, suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio-production of fuels in the future (reviewed in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 99| issue = 12| pages = 4943–4951| last1 = Spakowicz| first1 = Daniel J.| last2 = Strobel| first2 = Scott A.| title = Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds by fungi: bioengineering potential| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| date = 2015| doi=10.1007/s00253-015-6641-y| pmid = 25957494| pmc = 4677055}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Animal gut bacteria===
Microbial [[Gut flora|gastrointestinal flora]] in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria found in Zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_082511.cfm |title=Cars Could Run on Recycled Newspaper, Tulane Scientists Say |author=Kathryn Hobgood Ray |date=August 25, 2011 |work=Tulane University news webpage |publisher=Tulane University |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating [[biofuels]] from bamboo and other plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130910-panda-poop-might-help-turn-plants-into-fuel |title=Panda Poop Might Help Turn Plants Into Fuel |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood-feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Jian-Zhong|last2=Scharf|first2=Michael E.|title=Exploring and integrating cellulolytic systems of insects to advance biofuel technology|journal=Insect Science|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3|pages=163–165|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cornell Lab of Ornithology''' is a member-supported&lt;ref name="JoinLab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/join|title=Become a member, renew membership|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; unit of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] which studies birds and other wildlife. It is housed in the Imogene Powers Johnson Center for Birds and Biodiversity in Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary. Approximately 250 scientists, professors, staff, and students work in a variety of programs devoted to the Lab's mission: interpreting and conserving the Earth's biological diversity through research, education, and citizen science focused on birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/About/ |title=About Us, Annual Report, Staff Directory, Visit, Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work at the Lab is supported primarily by its 75,000 members. The Cornell Lab publishes books under the Cornell Lab Publishing Group, issues a quarterly publication, ''[[Living Bird]]'' magazine, and a distributes monthly electronic newsletter. It manages numerous [[citizen-science]] projects and websites, including the [[Webby Award]]-winning ''All About Birds''.&lt;ref name="allaboutbirds.org"&gt;http://www.allaboutbirds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cornell Lab of Ornithology was founded by Arthur A. "Doc" Allen who lobbied for creation of the country's first graduate program in ornithology, established at Cornell University in 1915. Initially, the Lab of Ornithology was housed in the university's entomology and limnology department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sapsuckerwoods.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=WBUASW&amp;Product_Code=2896&amp;Category_Code=4140 ''For the Birds''], by Randolph Scott Little, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Birder/businessman Lyman Stuart, donors, and landowners purchased or donated farmland in 1954 which was set aside for the sanctuary. Stuart helped finance the construction of the first Lab building in 1957. Lab founder Arthur Allen, with colleagues [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]], James Gutsell, and [[Francis Harper (biologist)|Francis Harper]], had dubbed the area Sapsucker Woods after discovering the first breeding [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]] ever reported in the [[Cayuga Lake]] Basin. This woodpecker is now common in the area and is part of the Cornell Lab's logo.

Today the Cornell Lab of Ornithology is housed in the Imogene Powers Johnson Center for Birds and Biodiversity which opened in summer 2003.

==Building and grounds==
[[File:Cornell Lab of Ornithology interior.JPG|thumb|The Visitors' Center entrance hall with the observatory on the left]]
The {{convert|226|acre|km2|adj=on}} Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary contains more than four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of trails taking visitors around Sapsucker Pond, on boardwalks, through [[wetlands]] and forest. More than 200 species of birds have been recorded in the sanctuary. Approximately 55,000 people visit the sanctuary and public areas of the Cornell Lab each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/education/visit |title=Visit the Lab, Hours, Directions, Sapsucker Woods, Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Visitor Center is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

The Visitors' Center observatory features a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wall of windows, seating, a fireplace, and spotting scopes. The Bartels Theater shows high-definition movies about birds and nature. A sound studio and kiosks educate visitors about bird and animal sounds. Two huge murals can also be found on observatory walls. One, by artists James Prosek, features numbered silhouettes of birds in their native habitats which visitors may try to identify. The other mural, by artist Jane Kim of Ink Dwell studio, follows the evolution of birds over millions of years from dinosaurs to the existing bird families of the world today. Some extinct species are also represented. Also in the observatory, visitors will find the "Sound Ring" by Maya Lin which plays soundscapes from a variety habitats around the world. The Wild Birds Unlimited at Sapsucker Woods gift shop is also located in the observatory. Other attractions include a multimedia program, wildlife artwork, a reconstructed study with murals by renowned painter [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]], a smaller second-floor observatory, and the Adelson Library which contains historical and contemporary ornithological materials, including an extensive collection of monographs and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/adelson |title=Adelson Library – Adelson Library |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Lab is an administrative unit within Cornell University.  It has a separate 30-member Administrative Board that is appointed by the Cornell Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=p16/&gt; As of fiscal year 2010, the Lab has an annual budget of $20.5&amp;nbsp;million and income of $21.9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/netcommunity/bbimages/clo/pdf/CornellLab_AnnualReport2010_Printable.pdf|title=2010 Annual Report|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-15|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 18 senior staff, which includes eight holding Cornell faculty appointments.&lt;ref name=p16&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/netcommunity/bbimages/clo/pdf/CornellLab_AnnualReport2010_Printable.pdf|title=2010 Annual Report|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-15|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Citizen science]]==
Collecting the observations of everyday birders for scientific use is a hallmark of the Lab. Bird watchers of all ages and skill levels help gather the data needed to capture the big picture about the distribution and abundance of birds. Approximately 200,000 people participate in the Lab's projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1664|title=What We Do Citizen Science|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[eBird]] database allows birders to track any of the earth’s 10,585 bird species to a single scientific database.  So far, observations on 10,415 species from 200 countries have been recorded.&lt;ref name=p4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/netcommunity/bbimages/clo/pdf/CornellLab_AnnualReport2010_Printable.pdf|title=2010 Annual Report|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-15|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observations of citizen scientists have helped document the declines of some species, the range expansions of others, and the spread of avian diseases. The observations of birders help the Cornell Lab study birds in cities, suburbs, and forests and help answer questions about how proximity to humans, pollution, climate change, and loss of habitat affect different species.

The Cornell Lab's citizen-science projects take place in all seasons and include Project FeederWatch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feederwatch.org |title=Project FeederWatch |publisher=Feederwatch.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NestWatch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nestwatch.org |title=NestWatch |publisher=NestWatch |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrate Urban Birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateurbanbirds.org |title=Celebrate – Celebrate Urban Birds |publisher=Celebrateurbanbirds.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds in Forested Landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/bfl/ |title=Birds In Forested Landscapes |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CamClickr,&lt;ref name="cornell1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watch.birds.cornell.edu/nestcams/clicker/clicker/index |title=CamClickr Website – CamClickr Information Page |publisher=Watch.birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two projects in partnership with the [[National Audubon Society]]: [[eBird]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebird.org |title=eBird News and Features – eBird |publisher=Ebird.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Backyard Bird Count|Great (Global) Backyard Bird Count]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdcount.org |title=Welcome to GBBC – Great Backyard Bird Count |publisher=Birdcount.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebird.org/content/ebird/news/great-global-backyard-bird-count-this-weekend/ |title=Great (Global) Backyard Bird Count this weekend!|publisher=ebird.org |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornell Lab operates many NestCams&lt;ref name="cornell1"/&gt; which capture live video of nesting birds in the spring.

==Educational resources==
The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has multiple ways for people to learn more about birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/education/ |title=Education Program – What We Do, Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More structured avenues include the self-paced, college-level course called [https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/courses/ornithology-comprehensive-bird-biology/ "Ornithology: Comprehensive Bird Biology]", which can be found on the Lab's education website, [https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/ Bird Academy]. The textbook for the course is the third edition of the [https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/textbook/ Handbook of Bird Biology] released in September 2016. The [http://www.birdsleuth.org/ BirdSleuth] curriculum is designed to help elementary and middle-school students discover science through bird projects. A five-week online course "[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/courses/courtship/ Investigating Behavior: Courtship and Rivalry in Birds]" is now available through [[eCornell]].

Informal resources include the free [http://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/ Merlin Bird ID]{{anchor|Merlin Bird ID}} app to help birders put a name to the birds they see, and covers 3,000 species of North, Central and South America, and Europe. Users answer simple questions to get a list of most likely species, along with images and sound. In 2017, Merlin Bird ID was updated to include AI-powered automatic photo recognition, which allows quick identification help with photographs. Other resources include:
* [https://www.allaboutbirds.org/ All About Birds] - an online bird guide that includes photos, sounds, and video for hundreds of North American bird species and up-to-date articles about bird research&lt;ref name="allaboutbirds.org"/&gt;

==Research==
Cornell Lab scientists, students, and visiting scholars are carrying on much original research in behavioral ecology, conservation, education, evolutionary biology, information systems, and population genetics. Cornell Lab engineers also develop hardware and software tools used in researching bird and animal communication and patterns of movement.

In the [[Evolutionary Biology]] laboratory researchers are extracting DNA from living birds or specimens to uncover the relationships among species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/evb/ |title=Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to countless studies and published papers, the Cornell Lab's [[Conservation biology|Conservation Science]] Department has produced land managers' guides aimed at conserving dwindling populations of scarlet tanagers, wood thrushes, and other forest birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/page.aspx?pid=1662#researchThemeHighlights=1 | title = Mission: Research — What we do | accessdate = 1 August 2014 | publisher = Cornell Lab of Ornithology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lab worked with Partners in Flight to identify rapidly declining species and produce the first North American Landbird Conservation Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/pif/cont_plan/default.htm |title=Partners in Flight – U.S.- North American Landbird Conservation Plan |publisher=Pwrc.usgs.gov |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lab staff also worked with multiple partners to create the first-ever State of the Birds report in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateofthebirds.org/ |title=2011 Report – Public Lands and Waters |publisher=Stateofthebirds.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lab's Neotropical Bird Conservation Program is gathering baseline data about bird populations in Mexico, where many North American birds spend their winters, and helping colleagues in other countries with conservation training and resources.

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology led the scientific arm of the search for the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]], overseen by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory |title=Welcome – Ivory-billed Woodpecker |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lab scientists are currently involved with partners from industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations in setting research priorities to better understand the impact of [[wind power]] facilities on birds and bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/pr/wind_wildlife_pr.html |title=Birds – Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioacoustics research==
The Lab's Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP) creates remote recording devices used by researchers in projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/ |title=Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Bioacoustics Research Program |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=August 9, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These autonomous recording units (ARUs) consist of a hard drive, housing, and microphone array&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/hardware/autonomous-recording-units |title=Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Bioacoustics Research Program |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be mounted in a forest or anchored to the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/hardware/pop-ups |title=Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Bioacoustics Research Program |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARUs have been used in the Elephant Listening Project in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/index.html |title=The Elephant Listening Project |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies of whales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listenforwhales.org/ |title=Right Whale Listening Network, Cornell, Bioacousti |publisher=Listenforwhales.org |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/multimedia/sounds/ |title=Ivory-bill Acoustics – Ivory-billed Woodpecker |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRP has also developed sound-analysis software programs called Raven and Raven Lite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/raven/RavenOverview.html |title=Raven: Interactive Sound Analysis Software |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers are working on programmable radio tags to track birds and other animals for longer periods of time and to follow bird migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/hardware/tagging-and-monitoring |title=Cornell Lab of Ornithology: Bioacoustics Research Program |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |date=April 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound archives==
From its earliest days, the Cornell Lab has had a special interest in bird and animal sounds. Founder Arthur Allen and his students were pioneers in the field, recording the first bird songs on a film sound track.

The world's largest collection of natural sounds is held in the climate-controlled archives of the Lab's Macaulay Library. There are more than 165,000 recordings of birds, bats, whales, insects, frogs, elephants, and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://macaulaylibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt; Macaulay Library recordists continue to mount expeditions to collect wildlife sounds and images from around the world to expand the archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaulaylibrary.org/inside/build/expeditions/index.do |title=ML : Build the Archive |publisher=Macaulaylibrary.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sounds are used by researchers around the world. They have also been used in everything from museum exhibits and Hollywood movies to singing alarm clocks and handheld PDAs that help users identify birds in the field. These sounds are used in the Cornell Lab's extensive list of audio guides. The Macaulay Library also contains a growing collection of high-definition video. Anyone can listen to recordings and watch videos in the archive.

Each year the experts from Macaulay Library hold the week-long [https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/contribute/workshops/ Sound Recording Workshop]. Participants learn how to effectively handle a portable field recording system to make scientifically accurate recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaulaylibrary.org/inside/record/index.do |title=ML : Learn to Record |publisher=Macaulaylibrary.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information science==
The [[Information Science]] unit creates the underlying structure that makes the Cornell Lab's citizen-science projects work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/is/ |title=Information Science – Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Birds.cornell.edu |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also converts massive amounts of data into charts, maps, and tables. Computer programmers at the Lab built the infrastructure for the Birds of North America Online and are now coordinating the Avian Knowledge Network, an unprecedented effort to link bird data records kept at institutions all over the Western Hemisphere. As of October 2009, the AKN contained more than 66.5&amp;nbsp;million records, accessible to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avianknowledge.net/content/ |title=Current News and Numbers – Avian Knowledge Network |publisher=Avianknowledge.net |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates==
The [[Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates]] is also housed in the Johnson Center and holds 1,230,000 specimens of fish, 44,300 amphibians &amp; reptiles, 45,000 birds, 3,200 eggs, and 15,000 mammals some now extinct. Students and scientists use the collections in their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumv.cornell.edu |title=Welcome to the CUMV – Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates |publisher=Cumv.cornell.edu |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corpus manager''' ('''corpus browser''' or '''corpus query system''') is a tool for multilingual [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] analysis, which allows effective searching in corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/pojmy:korpusovy_manazer |title=Korpusový manažer
 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=8 April 2015 |website=Wiki Český národní korpus
 |publisher=Český národní korpus |access-date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corpus manager usually represents a complex tool that allows one to perform searches for language forms or sequences. It may provide information about the context or allow the user to search by positional attributes, such as [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tag]], etc. These are called [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]]. Other features include the ability to search for [[Collocation]]s, frequency statistics as well as metadata information about the processed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kouklakis|first1=George|last2=Mikros|first2=George|last3=Markopoulos|first3=George|last4=Koutsis|first4=Ilias|title=Corpus Manager A Tool for Multilingual Corpus Analysis|journal=Proceedings from Corpus Linguistics Conference|date=2007|pages=1–12|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2007/244Paper.pdf|publisher=University of Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The narrower meaning of corpus manager refers only to the server side or the corpus query engine, whereas the client side is simply called the user interface.

A corpus manager can be software installed on a personal computer or it might be provided as a web service.

==Studies==
===Graduate===
From 1968-1971,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"&gt;K. M. Hiwale (Compiled), ''Directory of the United Theological College 1910-1997'', Bangalore, 1997. Past students of the college diploma course, p.39; Past students of the postgraduate course, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans studied a graduate degree for undergoing ministerial formation leading to [[Bachelor of Divinity]] ''([[B. D.]])'' at the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] under the Principalship of [[Joshua Russell Chandran]].  During his student days, the companions&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; of Hans at the College included [[S. J. Theodore]], [[Timotheas Hembrom]], [[H. S. Wilson]], [[P. J. Lawrence]], [[Basil Rebera]], [[J. W. Gladstone]] and others who were undergoing ministerial formation during successive years'.  In the ensuing convocation of the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]], Hans was awarded a graduate degree by the University during the Registrarship of [[C. Devasahayam]].

===Research studies===
For postgraduate studies, Hans again studied at the Protestant Regional Seminary in Bangalore from 1977 to 1979,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; specializing in Religions under G. D. Melanchthon, [[William Powlas Peery|William Peery]] and [[Eric J. Lott]], the three of whom hailed from the Missions in [[Andhra Pradesh]] with the latter two having taught at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad]].  During the period of his studies at the Seminary, the other postgraduate companions&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; of Hans included [[D. Dhanaraj]], [[R. Joseph]] and others studying during successive years'.  Hans entitled his dissertation as ''Critical Evaluation of the Contribution of the [[Hindu Code Bill]] to the status of women in the Hindu Society'' done under the supervision of Hunter P. Mabry&lt;ref&gt;D. I. Hans, ''Critical Evaluation of the Contribution of the [[Hindu Code Bill]] to the status of women in the Hindu Society'', M. Th. Thesis, 1979, available at the Archives in the library of [[Karnataka Theological College]], [[Mangalore]].&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded a postgraduate degree by the University in the successive convocation of the University during the Registrarship of [[D. S. Satyaranjan]].

==Ecclesiastical ministry==
As a Teacher of [[Religions]], Hans began to teach at a Seminary notable for its Religions Scholar, [[S. J. Samartha]].

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}'''Feminist anthropology''' is a four-field approach to [[anthropology]] ([[Archaeology|archeological]], [[Biological anthropology|biological]], [[Cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brodkin |first1=Karen |first2=Sandra |last2=Morgen |first3=Janis |last3=Hutchinson |title=Anthropology as White Public Space |journal=American Anthropologist |year=2011 |volume=113 |issue=4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Hortense Powdermaker]]), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the [[American Anthropological Association]] –&amp;nbsp;the [http://afa.americananthro.org/ Association for Feminist Anthropology]&amp;nbsp;– and its own publication, ''Voices''.

== History ==
Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.&lt;ref name="LewinIntro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Ellen | title = Feminist anthropology: a reader | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden | isbn = 1405101962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parezo | first = Nancy | title = Hidden scholars: women anthropologists and the Native American Southwest | year = 1993 | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque| isbn = 0826314287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erminnie A. Smith|Erminnie Platt Smith]], [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]], [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], [[Frances Densmore]]—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WomenAnthros&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gacs | first1 = Ute D. | last2 = Kahn | first2 = Aisha| last3 = McIntyre | first3 = Jerrie | last4 = Weinberg | first4 = Ruth | title = Women anthropologists: selected biographies | year = 1989 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Champagne|isbn=0252060849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography "The House of Lim" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.&lt;ref name=WolfInterview&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rofel | first = Lisa | title = The outsider within: Margery Wolf and feminist anthropology | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 596–604 | publisher = [[American Anthropological Association]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | date = September 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anthropologists like [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]] are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. [[Hortense Powdermaker]], for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, [[Zora Neale Hurston]], a student of [[Franz Boas]], the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely [[Katherine Dunham]] and [[Pearl Primus]], both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist [[Mary Leakey]].

The anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's "Women in the Field" and [[Michelle Rosaldo]] and [[Louise Lamphere]]'s edited volume ''[[Woman, Culture, and Society]]'', attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women.&lt;ref name=Golde&gt;{{cite book|last=Golde|first=Peggy|title=Women in the field: anthropological experiences|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0520054229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal.{{Dubious|date=February 2017}} A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with  [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]], arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism.&lt;ref name=Leacock&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | title = Interpreting the origins of gender inequality: Conceptual and historical problems | journal = [[Dialectical Anthropology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00249543 | date = February 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00249543 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schuller | first = Mark | title = Participation, more than add women and stir?

In the wake of [[Gayle Rubin]] and her critique of "the sex/gender system," the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident.&lt;ref name=Lugones&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lugones | first1 = María C. | last2 = Spelman | first2 = Elizabeth V. | title = Have we got a theory for you! Feminist theory, cultural imperialism and the demand for ‘the woman's voice’ | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages =573–581 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | date = 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists [[Henrietta Moore]] and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to "[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline".&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Henrietta L. | title = Feminism and anthropology | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = Hoboken | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780745667997 | oclc = 18259349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the "study of man" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.

Today, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces.&lt;ref name=FemEthnog&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Visweswaran | first = Kamala | title = Histories of feminist ethnography | journal = [[Annual Review of Anthropology]] | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 591–621 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | date = October 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.

==Feminist Archaeology==

[[Feminist archaeology]] initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as [[Archaeological theory#Post-processual archaeology|symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies]]. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)&lt;ref&gt;^ Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 571:89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.&lt;ref&gt;^ Gero, 1985:342. Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology. American Antiquity 50:342-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during "field work" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2013/04/13/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that s not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|first=Kate|last=Clancy|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/04/26/a-can-of-worms-worth-opening/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist Cultural Anthropology ==
Feminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of [[feminism]] through the lens of [[cultural anthropology]].  When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way.  New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions.  This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Feminist Anthropology: Past, Present, and Future|url=|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=44|issue=6|pages=99–101|doi=10.5860/CHOICE.44-3361|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender at the Crossroads of Knowledge : Feminist Anthropology in the Postmodern Era|last=Di Leonardo|first=Micaela|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. 

When feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing Culture|last=Behar|first=Ruth|last2=Gordon|first2=Deborah A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Relationship with Feminism==
The relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the [[Sexism|oppression of women]] is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of "woman" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist [[Michelle Rosaldo]] wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rosaldo, M.Z. |date=1980 |title=The Use and Abuse of Anthropology: Reflections on Feminism and Cross-Cultural Understanding |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=389–417 |issn=0097-9740 |doi=10.1086/493727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary feminist anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]] argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt;

Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been [[marginalized]] and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the [[Feminism in Latin America|grassroots feminism of Latin America]]), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"/&gt; Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking ''about'' and not ''for'' women, could overcome this bias.

Marilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.".&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt; Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricism]] of feminism.

==The 'double difference'==
Feminist anthropology, [[Rayna Rapp]] argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]]ism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.

Moore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.

'''[[Forensics|Forensic]] audio enhancement''' is the scientific analysis and improvement of audio clarity, typically to improve intelligibility.

Although the term is "enhancement", the process is almost entirely composed of [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] away unwanted sounds in order to leave a more understandable version.


==Admissibility as evidence==
* The processes applied must adhere to the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|standards of evidence]] and so it is admissible in a [[court of law]]. The audio expert must be able to document the steps they took, these steps must be replicable, no data can be created, and no judgment based edits or deletions can occur. Changes in pitch or speed can also render a recording inadmissible.
* The courts may require proper [[chain of custody]] documentation with this evidence. This includes appropriate precautions to ensure that the evidence is properly protected and stored.
* If the enhancement is performed using commercially available software, proof of vendor specified training and proficiency may be required.

The '''U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI)''', currently located in [[Walnut Creek, California]], was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in [[genome]] mapping, [[DNA sequencing]], technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (Berkeley Lab), [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL). Today, as a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Berkeley Lab, the JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the [http://hudsonalpha.org/ HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology]. The  JGI also collaborates with other national user facilities, such as the [https://www.emsl.pnl.gov/ Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory] at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL), t[http://www.nersc.gov/ he National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, or NERSC], is a high performance computing (supercomputer) user facility operated by  Berkeley Lab, and the [https://genomicscience.energy.gov/centers/ DOE Bioenergy Research Centers].

In 2019 the JGI will move to the new [https://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/location/ Integrative Genomics Building], joining forces with the [https://kbase.us/ DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)] on the Berkeley Lab main campus above the University of California, Berkeley. 

==History==
In 1999, the [[University of California]], which manages the three national labs for the DOE, leased laboratory and office space in a light industrial park in [[Walnut Creek, California]] to consolidate genome research activities. Led by biotechnology industry veteran [https://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/organization/strategic-management/nigel-mouncey/ Nigel Mouncey], who assumed the position of Director in March 2017, the DOE JGI receives its funding from the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in DOE's Office of Science.

Originally established to work on the [[Human Genome Project]]—the JGI generated the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19—the JGI has since shifted its focus to the non-human components of the biosphere, particularly those relevant to the DOE's science mission. Since 2004, the JGI has been a user facility that advances genomics research in a broad range of disciplines where DNA sequence information is likely to drive scientific discoveries.

In February 2004, the JGI launched the Community Sequencing Program (CSP), now known as the [http://jgi.doe.gov/collaborate-with-jgi/community-science-program/ Community Science Program], which provides the scientific community at large with access to high-throughput, high-quality sequencing, DNA synthesis, metabolomics and analysis capabilities. The projects involve many important multicellular organisms, microbes and communities of microbes called [[metagenome]]s (or microbiomes) related to the DOE mission areas of [[bioenergy]], understanding global cycles such as the [[carbon cycle]], and [[biogeochemistry]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and are chosen primarily based on scientific merit as determined by outside review.

In 2017, the JGI had 1,598 active primary users worldwide and over active 8,000 data users.

==Genome sequencing milestones==

[https://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/plant-genomics/plant-flagship-genomes/ Plant genomes] and fungal genomes that can inform the development of sustainable biofuels and bioproducts, and microorganisms such as those that thrive under extreme conditions such as high acidity, radiation and metal contamination are of particular interest to the DOE. Investigations by the JGI and its users are shedding light on plant biomass breakdown mechanisms and the cellular machinery of microbes and how they can be harnessed to clean up contaminated soil or water, capture carbon from the atmosphere and produce potentially important sources of energy such as hydrogen and methane.

In 2006, the JGI published the genome of the [http://jgi.doe.gov/news_9_14_06/ first tree sequenced]—the cottonwood ([[Populus|Populus trichocarpa]]). In partnership with other federal institutions and universities, the JGI has also published the genome sequences of sorghum; the microbial community in the termite hindgut, which could provide enzymes useful to biofuel production; microbes such as the bacteria ''Desulfovibrio'' that clean up sites contaminated with radioactive or toxic compounds; and algae involved in the global carbon cycle.

In 2009, the  JGI reached a sequencing capacity milestone, generated more than a trillion bases generated annually. In 2011, the JGI generated nearly 30 Terabases of sequence and in 2018, the JGI [http://jgi.doe.gov/our-projects/statistics/ will generate more than 200 Tb of sequence]. The JGI makes the high-quality data from genome sequencing, DNA synthesis, and metabolomics freely available to the greater scientific community on its website and on other public databases.

==Data management systems==

The JGI also supports programs dedicated to functional and evolutionary genomics related to the organisms and environments being sequenced and the development of computational and bioinformatic tools for data management and mining. These genome and metagenome/microbiome analysis systems include [http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ Genome Portal], [http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ Phytozome], [http://img.jgi.doe.gov/ IMG] and the Genomes OnLine Database.

The [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System]] (IMG), which provides a framework for comparative analysis of primarily microbial genomes, though the system also supports eukaryotic genomes and environmental samples. Its goal is to facilitate the visualization and exploration of genomes from a functional and evolutionary perspective.

The '''Jungian interpretation of religion''', pioneered by [[Carl Jung]] and advanced by his followers, is an attempt to interpret [[religion]] in the light of [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]]. Unlike [[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers, Jungians tend to treat religious beliefs and behaviors in a positive light, while offering psychological referents to traditional religious terms such as "[[soul]]", "[[evil]]", "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]", "the [[sacred]]", and "[[God]]". Because beliefs do not have to be true in order for people to hold them, the Jungian interpretation of religion has been, and continues to be, of interest to psychologists and theists.

==Jungian psychology==
{{main|Analytical psychology}}
Jung established a school of [[psychology]] which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] components of the psyche) through a process called [[Individuation#Carl Jung|individuation]]. Through studying [[folklore]], world [[mythology|mythologies]], and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as expressions of instinctual patterns (or [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]). The role of the [[psychoanalyst]] in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being cut off from the meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that the psyche is the source of healing and the drive toward individuation.

== Western religious tradition ==

Jung's assessment of [[Western religion]] arose both from his own experiences as well as from the psychotherapeutic work with his European clients. As a young man he had visions and dreams that were powerful and rich with meaning, yet he clung to Christianity. While he believed that God could "do stupendous things to me, things of fire and unearthly light", he was profoundly disappointed by his [[first communion]]—in his words, "nothing happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jaffe|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the same symptoms in his clients, namely, a fascination with the power of the unconscious, coupled with the inadequacy of Western religious symbols and rituals to represent this power. Summing up his analysis of the modern European situation he said: "Our age wants to experience the psyche for itself ... ''knowledge'', instead of ''faith''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jungian training analyst Murray Stein, Jung related theological and psychological constructs using three tenets:&lt;ref name="Stein_1990"&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Theological elements (such as God) can be interpreted to refer to psychological concepts.
# Psychologists can evaluate the adequacy of theological constructs against the dynamics of the psyche.
# Words about the psyche are also words about God, due to the correspondence between [[subjectivity]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].

Thus, proceeding by tenet #1 in ''[[Answer to Job]]'', Jung interpreted [[Yahweh]] as an archaic form of the self, [[Book of Job|Job]] as the ego, and [[Satan]] as the principle of individuation. Jung interprets the evolution of the god-image portrayed in the [[Old Testamen|Old]] and [[New Testament]] as a process of psychological development: In the Book of Job, the archaic self is prompted to develop toward consciousness by the more conscious ego, a process attended by dreams and prophesies (e.g. the Old Testament prophets). The self enters ego-consciousness (the incarnation of God in [[Jesus]] of Nazareth), followed by the emergence of the transcendent function (when the Holy Ghost comes to the disciples at Pentecost).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "A Psychological Approach to the Doctrine of the Trinity", again by tenet #1 Jung interprets the Father as the self, the source of energy within the psyche; the Son as an emergent structure of consciousness that replaces the self-alienated ego; and the Holy Spirit as a mediating structure between the ego and the self.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"&gt;{{harvp|Jung|1970b}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jung believed that the psyche moves toward completion in fours (made up of pairs of opposites), and that therefore (using tenet #3 above) the Christian formulation of the Trinity would give way to a quaternity by including missing aspects (e.g. the feminine and evil). (This analysis prompted Jung to send a congratulatory note to [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950 upon the adoption of the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], to wit completing the quaternity.)

== Eastern religious tradition ==

Jung wrote a number of books and articles about Eastern religions, including commentaries on the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', [[yoga]], and Eastern [[meditation]]. He also contributed forewords to books on [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Sadhu|Holy Men of India]], and the ''[[I Ching]]''.&lt;ref name="PaRWaE"/&gt;

==Gnosticism==
{{main|Gnosticism in modern times}}

Carl Jung and his associate [[G. R. S. Mead]] worked on trying to understand and explain the gnostic faith from a psychological standpoint. Jung's analytical psychology in many ways schematically mirrors ancient gnostic mythology, particularly those of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] and the 'classic' gnostic doctrine described in most detail in the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' (see [[Gnosticism#Major gnostic schools and their texts|gnostic schools]]).

Jung understands the emergence of the [[Demiurge]] out of the original, unified monadic source of the spiritual universe by gradual stages to be analogous to (and a symbolic depiction of) the emergence of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] from the unconscious. However, it is uncertain as to whether the similarities between Jung's psychological teachings and those of the Gnostics are due to their sharing a "[[perennial philosophy]]", or whether Jung was unwittingly influenced by the Gnostics in the formation of his theories. Jung's own 'gnostic hymn', the ''[[Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]'' (The Seven Sermons to the Dead), would tend to imply the latter, but after circulating the manuscript, Jung declined to publish it during his lifetime. Since it is not clear whether Jung was ultimately displeased with the book or whether he merely suppressed it as too controversial, the issue remains contested. Uncertain too are Jung's belief that the gnostics were aware of and intended psychological meaning or significance within their myths.

On the other hand, it is clear from a comparison of Jung's writings and that of ancient Gnostics, that Jung disagreed with them on the ultimate goal of the individual. Gnostics in ancient times clearly sought a return to a supreme, other-worldly [[Deity|Godhead]]. In a study of Jung, [[Robert Segal]] claimed that the eminent psychologist would have found the psychological interpretation of the goal of ancient Gnosticism (that is, re-unification with the [[Pleroma]], or the unknown God) to be psychically 'dangerous', as being a total identification with the unconscious. To contend that there is at least some disagreement between Jung and Gnosticism is at least supportable: the Jungian process of individuation involves the addition of unconscious psychic tropes to consciousness in order to achieve a trans-conscious centre to the personality. Jung did not intend this addition to take the form of a ''complete'' identification of the Self with the Unconscious.

== Extensions and criticisms ==
Edward F. Edinger systematized and extended Jung’s interpretation of the [[Judeo-Christian]] God, particularly in his book ''Ego and Archetype''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Edinger|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Wallace Clift]], an Episcopal priest, explored similarities between Jung’s vision of humanity as “a story of developing consciousness” with Christianity’s doctrine of “the Holy Spirit understood as present in each person. ... It is not a matter of making out each person a ‘God’, but on the contrary, realizing that within each person lies the potentiality of responding to God by bringing that encounter into consciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|1982|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further proposed the existence of a new post-Jungian archetype of ''pilgrimage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clift|Clift|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episcopal priest and Jungian analyst [[John A. Sanford]], interprets Jesus’ teachings from a Jungian perspective in his 1970 book ''The Kingdom Within'' in which he associates being a Pharisee with identifying with our mask or [[persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sanford|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interprets the Devil or temptation to sin as “the inner adversary”, the saying “love your enemies” as the dictate to discover and remove our projections from others, and advocates Jesus as the exemplar of human wholeness, uniting body, soul, spirit, sexuality, [[eros]], and meaning through love. Jungian analyst and professor of psychology and religion [[Robert L. Moore]] cites Christ as expressing four archetypes found in the male psyche: the Warrior (in wrestling with his inner demons in the desert and at Gethsemane);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992a|pp=113, 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lover (in radicalizing the commandment to love our neighbors);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993a|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Magician (in changing water to wine, feeding the thousands, and healing the sick);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1993b|pp=87, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the King (in generating the Kingdom of God, and in identifying himself with the way to the Father).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Gillette|1992b|pp=101–105, 186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hillman]], founder of [[archetypal psychology]], has done much to expose the unacknowledged or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself, ''e.g.'' one barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects and to the world.&lt;ref name="Hillman_94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hillman|Venura|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of roundness (e.g. the [[rose window]] of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.&lt;ref name="Hillman_79"/&gt;

Fr. Victor White, an English Dominican theologian and priest, and Jung carried on a 15&amp;nbsp;year correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lammers|Cunningham|Stein|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their dialog, White attempted to integrate analytical psychology into Catholic theology while Jung attempted to re-interpret Christian symbols. It was clear to White that “Jung was a psychiatrist and not a professional philosopher and/or theologian &amp;ndash; and that there were important theological issues which Jung seemed, for whatever reason, not to understand or to value”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Moore|Meckel|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unresolved point was White’s perspective that evil is the absence of good, whereas Jung believed that an adequate god image must include evil to balance the good. In addition, White floundered on Jung’s assumption that the Judeo-Christian god image changes over time, and that it would be replaced by something different in the distant future. In his 1994 book, [[Richard Noll]]  makes the case that Jung promoted his psychological theories as a pagan religion, and asserts that one cannot be both a Catholic and a Jungian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Noll|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent Jewish theologian and philosopher, [[Martin Buber]], had a lifelong interest in psychoanalysis, and may have attended the same ''Eranos'' conference with Jung in 1934. In 1952 Buber and Jung exchanged letters regarding a paper Buber had published entitled “Religion and Modern Thinking”. In his rejoinder, Buber claimed that Jung had strayed outside his realm of expertise into theology by asserting that God does not exist independent of the psyches of human beings. He concluded that Jung was “mystically deifying the instincts instead of hallowing them in faith”, which he called a “modern manifestation of Gnosis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buber Agassi|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi R. Goldenberg, after reviewing Jung’s idea of archetypes as disembodied Platonic forms and on the damage done to women by the [[mind-body dichotomy]], suggests that “feminist theory radically depart from the Jungian archetype [and] from all systems of thought that posit transcendent, superhuman deities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1989|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rejecting this part of Jungian theory, she recommends that women can use Jung’s practice of [[active imagination]], or “dreaming the dream onward”, to form a satisfying psychospiritual community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goldenberg|1992|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]’ book analyzing the dreams of the dying concludes that “the unconscious ... prepares [us] not for a definite end but for a profound transformation and for a kind of continuation of the life process”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joins with Edinger in suggesting that some dreams cannot be adequately interpreted as symbolic representations of subjective inner processes, but are “metaphysical”, hinting at a reality that is deeply mysterious.

Practices in [[language education]] vary significantly by region. Firstly, the languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]. Also, [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] tend to differ by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]].

==Europe==

===Foreign language education===
1995 [[European Commission]]’s White Paper "Teaching and learning – Towards the learning society", stated that "upon completing initial training, everyone should be proficient in two Community foreign languages". The Lisbon Summit of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.

In fact, even in 1974, at least one foreign language was compulsory in all but two European member states: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (apart from [[Scotland]]). By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} exception being the Republic of Ireland, where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]], but neither is considered a foreign language although a third European language is also taught. Pupils in upper secondary education learn at least ''two'' foreign languages in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slovakia]].

On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, pupils have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In Luxembourg, [[Norway]], [[Italy]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language starts at age six, in [[Sweden]] at age seven and in Belgium at age 10. About half of the EU's primary school pupils learn a foreign language.

English is the language taught most often at lower secondary level in the EU. There, 93% of children learn English. At upper secondary level, English is even more widely taught. [[French language|French]] is taught at lower secondary level in all EU countries except [[Slovenia]]. A total of 33% of European Union pupils learn French at this level. At upper secondary level the figure drops slightly to 28%. [[German language|German]] is taught in nearly all EU countries. A total of 13% of pupils in the European Union learn German in lower secondary education, and 20% learn it at an upper secondary level.

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey{{which|date=November 2010}} showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language. Less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language, for example. 80% said they could work abroad anyway, because "everyone speaks English." In 2001, a European Commission survey{{which|date=November 2010}} found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardize the learning of languages across Europe (one of the first results being [[UNIcert]]).

===Bilingual education===
{{Main|Bilingual education}}

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] community use partial immersion to teach both the minority and the state language.

In the 1960s and 1970s, some central and eastern European countries created a system of bilingual schools for well-performing pupils. Subjects other than languages were taught in a foreign language. In the 1990s this system was opened to all pupils in general education, although some countries still make candidates sit an entrance exam. At the same time, Belgium's French community, [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]] and [[Finland]] also started bilingual schooling schemes. [[Germany]] meanwhile had established some bilingual schools in the late 1960s.

==United States==
{{main|Language education in the United States}}
In most school systems, foreign language is taken in [[high school]], with many schools requiring one to three years of foreign language in order to graduate. In some school systems, foreign language is also taught during middle school, and recently, many elementary schools have begun teaching foreign languages as well. However, foreign language immersion programs are growing in popularity, making it possible for elementary school children to begin serious development of a second language.

In 2008 the Center for Applied Linguistics conducted an extensive survey documenting foreign language study in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/content/download/2241/29054/version/2/file/ForeignLanguageExecutiveSummary.pdf|title=Foreign Language Teaching in U.S. Schools: Results of a National Survey|last1=Rhodes|first1=Nancy C.|last2=Pufahl|first2=Ingrid|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|date=November 2009|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], due to the large number of recent Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States (see [[Spanish in the United States]]). According to this survey, in 2008 88% of language programs in elementary schools taught Spanish, compared to 93% in secondary schools. Other languages taught in U.S. high schools in 2008, in descending order of frequency, were [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. During the [[Cold War]], the United States government pushed for [[Russian language|Russian]] education, and some schools still maintain their Russian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0405/p11s02-legn.html|title=You learned Russian - in high school?|last=Méndez|first=Theresa|date=5 April 2005|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages recently gaining popularity include [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The Center for Applied Linguistics also conducted a study that concluded that while the number of schools from the elementary to secondary level offering foreign language instruction are on the rise, a pitfall of the curriculum is that students are not becoming proficient in the target languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pufahl|first=Ingrid|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also note that American students of foreign languages significantly underperform in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts.  It has been suggested that a system where foreign language instruction is required from PK-12 should be implemented in order to fix this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognitive Benefits of Learning Language|url=http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4724|publisher=Online Newsletter for Parents of Gifted Youth|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Prior to European colonisation, there were hundreds of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]], taught in a traditional way. The arrival of a substantial number of [[Irish language|Irish]] in the first English convict ships meant that European Australia was not ever truly monolingual. When the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] of the 1850s trebled the white population, it brought many more [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers, who had their own language newspapers through to the 1870s, but the absence of language education meant that these Celtic languages never flourished.

Waves of [[Post-war immigration to Australia|European migration after World War II]] brought "community languages," sometimes with schools. However, from 1788 until modern times it was generally expected that immigrants would learn English and abandon their first language.&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;{{broken citation|date=March 2011}} The wave of [[Multiculturalism in Australia|multicultural policies]] since the 1970s has softened aspects of these attitudes.

In 1982 a bipartisan committee of Australian parliamentarians was appointed and identified a number of guiding principles that would support a National Policy on Languages (NPL). Its trend was towards bilingualism in all Australians, for reasons of fairness, diversity and economics.

In the 1990s the Australian Languages and Literacy Policy (ALLP) was introduced, building on the [https://books.google.com/books/about/National_Policy_on_Languages.html?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ NPL], with extra attention being given to the economic motivations of second language learning. A distinction became drawn between priority languages and community languages. The ten priority languages identified were [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]].

However, Australia's federal system meant that the NPL and ALLP direction was really an overall policy from above without much engagement from the states and territories. The NALSAS strategy united Australian Government policy with that of the states and territories. It focused on four targeted languages: Mandarin, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean. This would be integrated into studies of Society and Environment, English and Arts.

By 2000, the top ten languages enrolled in the final high school year were, in descending order: Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Indonesian, Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Spanish and Arabic. In 2002, only about 10% of Year 12 included at least one [[Languages other than English|language other than English]] (LOTE) among their course choices.
In 2009, Lo Bianco and Slaughter, recommended a new approach, stating that “What is needed is a universal apprenticeship in learning how to learn languages”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Second Languages and Australian Schooling | author=Lo Bianco, J | year=2009 | publisher=Australian Council for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apprenticeship language is a relatively easy language which is taught to overcome the limitations of monolingualism, in preparation for later mastery of a different language or languages. 

Reasons to use an apprenticeship language are:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

* To make a start when target language teachers are unavailable.
* To master a whole foreign language, for motivation and effective subsequent learning.
* To combat procrastination in the face of diverse priorities in Language education.
* To normalize bilingualism and promote flexibility.
* To model creative problem solving, ethical behaviour and global citizenship.

A resource and method has been devised to implement the ALL approach by equipping generalist primary (elementary) teachers to teach the simple designed language [[Esperanto]] as a [[Propaedeutic value of Esperanto|first, fluent, intercultural, foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Talking to the Whole Wide World: Integrated LOTE and Intercultural Studies for Australian Primary Schools | author=Vos, P | year=2010 | publisher=Mondeto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional body for teachers of foreign languages in Australia is the [[Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations]].

'''Learning disability''' is a classification that includes several areas of functioning in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors. Given the "difficulty learning in a typical manner", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a "learning difference", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the UK, the term "learning disability" generally refers to an [[intellectual disability]], while difficulties such as [[dyslexia]] and [[dyspraxia]] are usually referred to as "learning difficulties".

While ''learning disability'', ''learning disorder'' and ''learning difficulty'' are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (psychologist, pediatrician, etc.). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term "learning disorder" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.&lt;ref name=ChildhoodVoyagesinDevelopmentThirdEdition&gt;''Childhood Voyages in Development'', Third Edition, Thomson Wadsworth. (2008), p. 387. Retrieved 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), mathematics ([[dyscalculia]]) and writing ([[dysgraphia]]).&lt;ref name=ChildhoodVoyagesinDevelopmentThirdEdition/&gt;

The unknown factor is the disorder that affects the [[Human brain|brain]]'s ability to receive and process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.

Individuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions, and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. Current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports. Teachers, parents, and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners. School psychologists and other qualified professionals quite often help design the intervention and coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents.

==Definitions==
Representatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities|url=http://www.ldonline.org/about/partners/njcld|website=LD Online |date=2010 |publisher=WETA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NJCLD used the term 'learning disability' to indicate a discrepancy between a child’s apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;1981; 1985.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several difficulties existed, however, with the NJCLD standard of defining learning disability. One such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability. This conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning. On the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction. The NJCLD notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=LD Definition |journal=Learning Disability Quarterly |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=May 1987 |pages=136–138 |doi=10.2307/1510220 |subscription=yes |jstor=1510220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1980s, NJCLD, therefore, defined the term learning disability as: &lt;blockquote&gt;a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g. [[sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]], [[intellectual disability]], social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, [[wikt:psychogenic|psychogenic]] factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD). This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies. The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual. SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes. SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as intellectual disability, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits.&lt;ref name="BradleyDanielson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Renée |last1=Bradley|first2=Louis C. |last2=Danielson|first3=Daniel P. |last3=Hallahan|title=Identification of learning disabilities: research to practice|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Identification_of_Learning_Disabilities.html?id=QSv7yyicod0C|accessdate=2 May 2010|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-4448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=September 2013}}&lt;ref name="urlNational Research Center on Learning Disabilities (NRCLD)"&gt;{{cite report|first1=Daniel J. |last1=Reschly |first2=John L. |last2=Hosp |first3=Catherine M. |last3=Schmied |date=20 August 2003 |title=And Miles to Go…: State SLD Requirements and Authoritative Recommendations |at=Recommendations for Change in SLD Definition and Classification Criteria |institution=National Research Center on Learning Disabilities (NRCLD) |accessdate=2010-05-01 |url=http://nrcld.org/about/research/states/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925202022/http://nrcld.org/about/research/states/index.html |archive-date=25 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiff|first1=Henry B.|last2=Gerber|first2=Paul J.|last3=Ginsberg|first3=Rick|title=Definitions of Learning Disabilities from Adults with Learning Disabilities: The Insiders' Perspectives|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|volume=16|issue=2|date=Spring 1993|pages=114–125|doi=10.2307/1511133|jstor=1511133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "learning disability" does not exist in [[DSM-IV]], but it has been added to the [[DSM-5]]. The [[DSM-5]] does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics, or written expression. Instead, it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specific Learning Disorder |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Specific%20Learning%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |website=American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Development |date=15 May 2013 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the terms '''learning disability''' and '''learning disorder''' (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to [[speech|speak]], [[Listening|listen]], [[Reading (process)|read]], [[writing|write]], [[spelling|spell]], [[reason]], organize [[information]], and do [[math]]. People with learning disabilities generally have  intelligence that is average or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Learning Disabilities |url=https://ldaamerica.org/types-of-learning-disabilities/ |publisher=Learning Disabilities Association of America |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation in the United States====
The [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973]], effective May 1977, guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.{{citation needed |date=September 2016}}

The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], formerly known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]], is a [[United States federal law]] that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, [[special education]] and related services to children with disabilities. It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|20|1400}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Canada====
In Canada, the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents. Originally called the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada – LDAC was created to provide awareness and services for individuals with learning disabilities, their families, at work, and the community. Since education is largely the responsibility of each province and territory in Canada, provinces and territories have jurisdiction over the education of individuals with learning disabilities, which allows the development of policies and support programs that reflect the unique multicultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic conditions of its area.&lt;ref&gt;Stegemann, K. C. (2016). Learning disabilities in Canada. Learning Disabilities: A Contemporary Journal, (1), 53. Retrieved November 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], terms such as specific learning difficulty (SpLD), [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]] and [[dyscalculia]] are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as "learning disabilities". In the UK, the term "learning disability" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized [[intellectual disability|cognitive impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Ken|title=Learning Disabilities Factsheet|url=http://www.bild.org.uk/resources/factsheets/|website=bild.org.uk|publisher=British Institute of Learning Disabilities|accessdate=13 September 2017|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lancet'' defines 'learning disability' as a "significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood", and states that roughly one in 50 British adults have one.&lt;ref name="The Lancet, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=&lt;!--editorial staff--&gt;|title=Demography still dictates destiny for children with disabilities|journal=Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9993 |year=2015 |pages=503 |issn= |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61459-3 |pmid=26293424 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development, and has improved drastically in the last{{which|date=December 2014}} decade. The first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999, and in 2001, the Enrichment Project for the Support System for Students with Learning Disabilities was established. Since then, there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mika |last1=Kataoka |first2=Christina E. |last2=van Kraayenoord |first3=John |last3=Elkins |title=Principals' and Teachers' Perceptions of Learning Disabilities: A Study from NARA Prefecture, Japan |journal=Learning Disability Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=3 |date=August 2004 |pages=161–175 |doi=10.2307/1593666 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

The effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well. Neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers.&lt;ref&gt;Rourke, B. P. (1989). Nonverbal learning disabilities: The syndrome and the model. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label. It has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations. Emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shifrer | first1 = Dara | last2 = Callahan | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Muller | first3 = Chandra | year = 2013 | title = Equity or Marginalization? The High School Course-Taking of Students Labeled With a Learning Disability | url = | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 656–82 | doi=10.3102/0002831213479439| pmc = 4074008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential (as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shifrer | first1 = Dara | year = 2013 | title = Stigma of a Label: Educational Expectations for High School Students Labeled with a Learning Disability | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 462–480 | doi=10.1177/0022146513503346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Genizi, J. (2013) Primary headaches, attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities in children and adolescents. The Journal of Headache and Pain [online]. Available at: https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1129-2377-14-54 (accessed 23/10/17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem. These studies have shown that an individual‘s self-esteem is indeed affected by his or her awareness of their learning disability. Students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement. However, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem. Skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem. Also, a positive perception of one’s physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem. Another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity. This demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cisden | first1 = Merith | last2 = Elliot | first2 = Katherine | last3 = Noble | first3 = Sharon | last4 = Kelemen | first4 = Eve | year = 1999 | title = Self-Understanding and Self-Esteem in Children with Learning Disabilities | url = | journal = Learning Disability Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 279–290 | doi = 10.2307/1511262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. However, some causes of neurological impairments include:
; Heredity and genetics
: Learning disabilities often run in the family. Children with learning disabilities are likely to have parents or other relatives with similar difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-explained/basic-facts/what-are-learning-disabilities |title=What are Learning Disabilities? |publisher=The National Center for Learning Disabilities |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2012 |archive-date=17 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717081710/http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-explained/basic-facts/what-are-learning-disabilities |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children have spontaneous mutations (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause [[developmental disorder]]s including learning disabilities.  One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRae|first=Jeremy F.|last2=Clayton|first2=Stephen|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Tomas W.|last4=Kaplanis|first4=Joanna|last5=Prigmore|first5=Elena|last6=Rajan|first6=Diana|last7=Sifrim|first7=Alejandro|last8=Aitken|first8=Stuart|last9=Akawi|first9=Nadia|title=Prevalence and architecture of de novo mutations in developmental disorders|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature21062|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature21062|year=2017|volume=542|pages=433–438}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations, for example a fault in the [[CDK13 (gene)|CDK13]] gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38691622|title=Child gene study identifies new developmental disorders|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|date=2017-01-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Problems during pregnancy and birth

; Accidents after birth
:Learning disabilities can also be caused by [[Head injury|head injuries]], [[malnutrition]], or by toxic exposure (such as [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] or pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://apparentlifestyle.com/blog/2014/07/09/children-with-learning-difficulty/ |title=Helping Children with Learning Difficulty |website=Apparent Lifestyle |date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=No information about article author or site ownership.|date=September 2016}}

==Diagnosis==

===IQ-achievement discrepancy===
Learning disabilities can be identified by [[psychiatrist]]s, [[school psychologist]]s, [[clinical psychologist]]s, [[counseling psychologist]]s, [[neuropsychologist]]s and other learning disability specialists through a combination of [[intelligence test]]ing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term "disorder" rather than "disability").

Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers.&lt;ref name=Aaron1995&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aaron, P.G. | year = 1995 | title = Differential Diagnosis of Reading Disabilities | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–60 | issn = 0279-6015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Patti L. Harrison |author2=Flanagan, Dawn P. |title=Contemporary intellectual assessment: theories, tests, and issues |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-125-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD.&lt;ref name =Fletcher&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marcia A. Barnes |author2=Fletcher, Jack |author3=Fuchs, Lynn |title=Learning Disabilities: From Identification to Intervention |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-59385-370-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).

===Response to intervention===
Much current research has focused on a treatment-oriented [[diagnostic]] process known as [[response to intervention]] (RTI). Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria. Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress.&lt;ref name =Fletcher/&gt; Those who respond will not require further intervention. Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called "Tier 1 instruction") and a more intensive intervention (often called "Tier 2" intervention) are considered "non-responders." These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability. Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.

A primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Finn | first = C.E.,  Rotherham A.J. &amp; Hokanson C.R. | year = 2001 | title = Rethinking Special Education For A New Century | publisher = Progressive Policy Institute | url= http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=110&amp;subsecID=900030&amp;contentID=3344  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may, in turn, result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.

The process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction. By not taking into account specific cognitive processes, RTI fails to inform educators about a students' relative strengths and weaknesses&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher-Janzen, Reynolds. (2008). Neuropsychological Perspectives on Learning Disabilities in the Era of RTI: Recommendations for Diagnosis and Intervention&lt;/ref&gt; Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. Third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and is not driven by psychologists, reading specialists, or special educators.

===Latino English language learners===

Demographers in the United State report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the United States over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Child Trends, 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods. Various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is English. It is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in English language learners (ELL) differs. In the United States, there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services, specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=Melissa |last2=Kabler |first2=Brenda |last3=Sugarman |first3=Melissa |date=January 2011 |title=Understanding the plight of immigrant and refugee students |journal=Communiqué |volume=39 |issue=5 |publisher=National Association of School Psychologists |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/communique/issues/volume-39-issue-5/multicultural-affairs-understanding-the-plight-of-immigrant-and-refugee-students }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing English language learners (ELL) with specific learning disabilities (SLD). This is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are unable to clearly assess if a student’s delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability. With an unclear diagnosis, many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system. For example, in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with English language learners. Students were commonly pushed toward testing, based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education.&lt;ref name=Klinger2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klingner |first1=Janette K. |last2=Harry |first2=Beth |date=2006 |title=The special education referral and decision-making process for English language learners: Child study team meetings and placement conferences |journal=Teachers College Record |volume=108 |issue=11 |pages=2247–2281 |url=http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=12804 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00781.x |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ELLs' growth in language and academically.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez et al., 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ELLs are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities.&lt;ref name=Klinger2006/&gt; Additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the U.S dealing could be potentially dealing with. These factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2009; Martines, 2008; Rhodes.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ochoa2005&gt;Ochoa, &amp; Ortiz, 2005.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families. Many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisby |first=Craig L. |date=2013 |title=Meeting the psychoeducational needs of minority students: Evidence-based guidelines for school psychologists and other school personnel |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley and Sons |doi=10.1002/9781118092620 |isbn=978-1-118-09262-0 |oclc=822560271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

===Spanish-speaking ELL===

A well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool. Also, an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments.&lt;ref name=Ochoa2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geva, E., &amp; Wiener, J. (2015). Psychological assessment of culturally and linguistically diverse children and adolescents: A practitioner’s guide. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; A compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ELL student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors. It is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools. Also, many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ELL students.

===Assessment===
Many normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.

The most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV), Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT II), the Wide Range Achievement Test III (WRAT III), and the Stanford Achievement Test–10th edition. These tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty.&lt;ref name = Fletcher/&gt;

In the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests–2nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment. Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV&amp;nbsp;– Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency. A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), 2007.[http://www.sedl.org/reading/rad/chart.html Southwest Educational Development Laboratory] Accessed September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioral issues or language delays.&lt;ref name = Fletcher/&gt; These contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students' behaviors and compares them to standardized norms.

However, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with Down's syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N. "Dementia and memory: a guide for students and health professionals." Aldershot: Ashgate 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 2000 | title = The Central Executive System in people with Down's syndrome and dementia | url = | journal = Clinical Gerontologist | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 3–32 | doi=10.1300/j018v21n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 2000 | title = Investigation into Down's syndrome and dementia | url = | journal = Journal of the Association of Practitioners in Learning Disability | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 10–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 1999 | title = Examining dementia in Down's syndrome (DS): decline in social abilities in DS compared with other learning disabilities | url = | journal = Clinical Gerontologist | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 23–44 | doi=10.1300/j018v20n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 1999 | title = Assessing dementia in people with learning disabilities for cognitive rehabilitation | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 14–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Learning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.

===By stage of information processing===
Learning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading and Learning Disabilities |website=National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHY) |publisher=Academy for Educational Development (AED) |date=2004 |url=http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs17txt.htm |access-date=11 May 2007 |archive-date=23 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523213649/http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs17txt.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time, as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. Reid |last=Lyon |title=Learning Disabilities |journal=The Future of Children |date=1996 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=54–76 |jstor=1602494 |doi=10.2307/1602494 |pmid=8689262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Input
: This is the information perceived through the senses, such as visual and auditory perception. Difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape, position, or size of items seen. There can be problems with [[Sequence learning|sequencing]], which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception. Difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them, such as the sound of the teacher's voice in a classroom setting. Some children appear to be unable to process tactile input. For example, they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched.
; Integration
: This is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted, categorized, placed in a sequence, or related to previous learning. Students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence, unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week, able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning, or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the "big picture." A poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension.
; Storage
: Problems with memory can occur with short-term or working memory, or with long-term memory. Most memory difficulties occur with one's short-term memory, which can make it difficult to learn new material without more repetitions than usual. Difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell.
; Output
: Information comes out of the brain either through words, that is, language output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing. Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language. Such difficulties include answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak. It can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons. Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills. People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things. They may also have trouble running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle. People with fine motor difficulties may have trouble with handwriting, buttoning shirts, or tying shoelaces.

===By function impaired===
Deficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities.&lt;ref name="titleAmanda Kirby speaking to dysTalk on The Co-occurrence of learning difficulties"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/57-co-occurrence-of-learning-difficulties |title=Amanda Kirby speaking on the co-occurrence of learning difficulties |publisher=dysTalk |accessdate=2009-04-22 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the term ''[[dual diagnosis]]'' is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.

====Reading disorder (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes: F81.0/315.00)====
Reading disorder is the most common learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision.  |vauthors=Handler SM, etal | journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2011 | volume=127 | issue=3 | pages=e818–56 | doi=10.1542/peds.2010-3670 | pmid=21357342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70–80% have deficits in reading. The term "[[dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]]" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension. Before the term "dyslexia" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as "word blindness."

Common indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awareness—the ability to break up words into their component sounds, and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds (sound-symbol correspondence).

====Disorder of written expression (ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR codes 315.2)====

{{further|Disorder of written expression}}

The DSM-IV-TR criteria for a '''disorder of written expression''' is writing skills (as measured by a standardized test or functional assessment) that fall substantially below those expected based on the individual's chronological age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education, (Criterion A). This difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text (Criterion B), and if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit, (Criterion C).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship. A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis. If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals' motor coordination, a diagnosis of [[developmental coordination disorder]] should be considered.

By a number of organizations, the term "[[dysgraphia]]" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression.

====Math disability (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes F81.2-3/315.1)====

{{further|Dyscalculia}}

Sometimes called [[dyscalculia]], a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor "number sense".&lt;ref name="titleDyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/32-what-is-dyscalculia |title=Dyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non ICD-10/DSM====
* [[Nonverbal learning disability]]: Nonverbal learning disabilities often manifest in motor clumsiness, poor visual-spatial skills, problematic social relationships, difficulty with mathematics, and poor organizational skills. These individuals often have specific strengths in the verbal domains, including early speech, large vocabulary, early reading and spelling skills, excellent rote memory and auditory retention, and eloquent self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lerner, Janet W. |title=Learning disabilities: theories, diagnosis, and teaching strategies |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-395-96114-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disorders of speaking and listening: Difficulties that often co-occur with learning disabilities include difficulty with memory, social skills and [[executive functions]] (such as organizational skills and time management).

==Management==

Reading, MA: Perseus Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', Dec 1973; vol. 6: pp. 609 - 614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===School laws===

Schools in the United States have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country, including undocumented students. The landmark Supreme Court ruling [[Plyler v. Doe]] (1982) grants all children, no matter their legal status, the right to a free education.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Plyler v. Doe |vol=457 |reporter= |opinion=202 |pinpoint= |court=U.S. |date=1982 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling suggests that as a country we acknowledge that we have a population of students with specific needs that differ from those of native speakers. Additionally specifically in regards to ELL's the supreme court ruling [[Lau v. Nichols]] (1974) stated that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lau v. Nichols |volume=414 |court=U.S. |opinion=563 |date=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless.This ruling is also supported by English language development services provided in schools, but unfortunately, these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider.

===Critique of the medical model===
Learning disability theory is founded in the [[medical model of disability]], in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallego|first1=Margaret A.|last2=Durán|first2=Grace Zamora|last3=Reyes|first3=Elba I.|title=It Depends: A Sociohistorical Account of the Definition and Methods of Identification of Learning Disabilities|journal=Teachers College Record|date=November 2006|volume=108|issue=11|pages=2195–2219|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00779.x|url=http://www.nccrest.org/ELL_PPT/Gallego_Duran_Reyes.ppt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = D.

===Culture===
There are three patterns that are well known in regards to mainstream students and minority labels in the United States:
* "A higher percentage of minority children than of white children are assigned to special education";
* "within special education, white children are assigned to less restrictive programs than are their minority counterparts";

In the present day, it has been reported that white districts have more children from minority backgrounds enrolled in special education than they do majority students. “It was also suggested that districts with a higher percentage of minority faculty had fewer minority students placed in special education suggesting that 'minority students are treated differently in predominantly white districts than in predominantly minority districts'".&lt;ref name = Fletcher2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = T.V. | last2 = Navarrete | first2 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Learning disabilities or difference: A critical look at issues associated with misidentification and placement of Hispanic students in special education programs | url = | journal = Classics RESQ Article | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 30–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social roots of learning disabilities in the U.S.===
One of the clearest indications of the social roots of learning disabilities is the disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding,&lt;ref name="Patton1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patton|first1=J. M.|title=The Disproportionate Representation of African Americans in Special Education: Looking Behind the Curtain for Understanding and Solutions|journal=The Journal of Special Education|volume=32 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=25–31|issn=0022-4669|doi=10.1177/002246699803200104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid, Knight, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=D.

While many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Haveman, Robert |author2=Sandefur, Gary |author3=Wolfe,  Barbara |author4=Voyer, Andrea |chapter=Trends in children's attainments and their determinants as family income inequality has increased |editors=Neckerman, Kathryn M. |title=Social inequality |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |location=New York |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-87154-620-5 |oclc=53903734 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability.&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Muller, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shifrer |first1=Dara |title=Disability as a Fluid State |last2=Muller|first2=Chandra |last3=Callahan |first3=Rebecca |volume=5 |year=2010 |pages=279–308|issn=1479-3547|doi=10.1108/S1479-3547(2010)0000005014 |url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-17|chapter=Disproportionality: A sociological perspective of the identification by schools of students with learning disabilities |series=Research in Social Science and Disability |isbn=978-0-85724-377-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Callahan, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shifrer |first1=D.|last2=Muller |first2=C.|last3=Callahan |first3=R.|title=Disproportionality and Learning Disabilities: Parsing Apart Race, Socioeconomic Status, and Language|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=44|issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=246–257 |issn=0022-2194 |doi=10.1177/0022219410374236 |url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality&amp;Disability.pdf|pmc=4133990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES Whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES Whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES. Summarily, because the risk of identification for White students who have low SES is similar to that of Black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Muller, 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Callahan, 2010"/&gt; It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.

==Contrast with other conditions==
People with an [[IQ]] lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an [[intellectual disability]] and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence.

[[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities. An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD. A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD. The conditions can co-occur.

People diagnosed with ADHD sometimes have impaired learning. Some of the struggles people with ADHD have might include lack of motivation, high levels of [[anxiety]], and the inability to process information.&lt;ref name="Reaser, A. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reaser | first1 = A. | last2 = Prevatt | first2 = F. | last3 = Petscher | first3 = Y. | last4 = Proctor | first4 = B. | year = 2007 | title = The learning and study strategies of college students with ADHD | url = | journal = Psychology in the Schools | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 627–638 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are studies that suggest people with ADHD generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities. Also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with ADHD be academically successful.&lt;ref name="Reaser, A. 2007"/&gt;

Some research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs since it is being shown to have a strong effect on "executive functions" required for learning. This has not as yet affected any official definitions. Though, historically, ADHD was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning.{{citation needed |date=September 2016}} Scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with ADHD.

In [[toxicology]], the '''Lowest published toxic dose''' ('''Toxic Dose Low''', '''TD&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the lowest [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] per unit of bodyweight (typically stated in [[milligram]]s per [[kilogram]]) of a [[Chemical substance|substance]] known to have produced signs of [[toxicity]] in a particular [[animal]] [[species]].  When quoting a TD&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt;, the particular species and method of administration (''e.g.'' ingested, inhaled, [[intravenous]]) are typically stated.

{{Redirect|Masonic Hall}}
{{Freemasonry}}
A '''Masonic Temple''' or '''Masonic Hall''' is, within [[Freemasonry]], the room or edifice where a [[Masonic Lodge]] meets. Masonic Temple may also refer to an abstract spiritual goal and the conceptual ritualistic space of a meeting.

==Development and history==
[[File:Goose and Gridiron.jpg|thumb|220px|Goose and Gridiron tavern, where the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] was founded in 1717]]
In the early years of Freemasonry, from the 17th through the 18th centuries, it was most common for Masonic Lodges to form their Masonic Temples either in private homes or in the private rooms of public taverns or halls which could be regularly rented out for Masonic purposes. This was less than ideal, however; meeting in public spaces required the transportation, set-up and dismantling of increasingly elaborate paraphernalia every time the lodge met.  Lodges began to look for permanent facilities, dedicated purely to Masonic use.

== First Temples ==
The first Masonic Hall was built in 1765 in [[Marseille]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G: ''Use and Abuse of Freemasonry'', page 165., 1783.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later in May, 1775, the cornerstone of what would come to be known as [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]], London, was laid in solemn ceremonial form spurring a trend that would continue to present day.&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"&gt;Mackey, A: ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: And Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts, Sciences and Literature As Connected With the Institution'', page 314. Moss &amp; Co., 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most lodges, however, could not afford to build their own facilities and instead rented rooms above commercial establishments (hotels, banks and opera houses were the most common landlords).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Masonic Temples'', pp.121–123&lt;/ref&gt;  With permanent facilities, the term "Masonic Temple" began to be applied not just to the symbolic formation of the Temple, but also to the physical place in which this took place.  It began to be applied to the lodge rooms themselves. (A similar transfer took place with the term ''Masonic Lodge'', which in ritual terms refers to the people assembled and not to the place of assemblage.  In common usage, however, it began to be applied to the place as well as the people.)

[[File:Belleville Masonic Temple.JPG|thumb|The Belleville Masonic Temple, [[Belleville, Michigan]]. An example of a smaller Masonic Temple]]
In the latter half of the nineteenth century, as the popularity of Freemasonry grew, more and more lodges began to have the financial wherewithal to own their own premises.  In many locations this was spurred by changing tax laws that allowed fraternal and benevolent societies to own property and lease space without being taxed as commercial landlords.  In larger towns and cities, where there were many lodges, it became economical for groups of lodges to band together and either purchase or build their own buildings with both commercial space and lodge rooms in the same building.  The rents from the commercial space going to the upkeep of the lodge rooms.  This was especially true in cities where the Grand Lodge met.&lt;ref&gt;Moore; ''Masonic Temples''; pp 124–129&lt;/ref&gt; These buildings, too, began to be referred to as "Masonic Temples", "Masonic Halls", or "Masonic Lodges".&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"/&gt;

In smaller towns the trend was different.  Here, instead of building large impressive buildings in the hopes of attracting multiple commercial tenants, the local lodges tended to build more modest structures, with space for a single tenant, a small meeting hall for public rental, or no rental space at all.  In addition, especially in the United States, lodges founded in established communities would purchase buildings that had historic value as lodge members wanted their new lodge to be associated with the history of their local community like their older counterparts.  Thus they looked to purchase old churches, schools and the homes of community founders, which they would convert into lodge meeting space.  These too began to be known as "Masonic Temples".&lt;ref&gt;Moore; Masonic Temples; pp.129 – 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heyday and decline==
[[File:Detroit Masonic Temple - Detroit Michigan.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Detroit Masonic Temple]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The world's largest Masonic Temple.]]
[[File:Santacruzmasontemple03.jpg|thumb|[[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] ([[Spain]]).]]
The 1920s marked a [[Golden age of fraternalism|heyday]] for Freemasonry, especially in the United States.  By 1930, over 12% of the adult male population of the United States were members of the fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbert, Mark A.; ''American Freemasons, Three Centuries of Building Communities''; New York University Press, New York, 2005. p.168&lt;/ref&gt;  The dues generated by such numbers allowed state Grand Lodges to build on truly monumental scales.  Typical of the era are the [[Dayton Masonic Center]] and [[Detroit Masonic Temple]] (the largest Masonic Temple in the world).

The [[Great Depression]] hit Freemasonry as hard as it hit the rest of the world, and both local Lodges and Grand Lodges turned away from erecting buildings and towards helping those in need. [[World War II]] saw resources focused on supporting the War effort. While there was something of a resurgence in the 1950s, the anti-establishment attitudes of the 1960s and 1970s affected membership numbers even further. Lodges began to close and merge, with those that could no longer afford to maintain their buildings selling these to developers. Many Masonic Temples and Halls were converted to non-masonic uses including completely commercial spaces, hotels, night clubs, and even condominiums.  Many lodges have returned to renting rooms, and there is even a small movement calling for Freemasonry to return to its roots and open their Masonic Temples in taverns.

==Naming conventions==
When Freemasons first began building dedicated structures the more frequently used term for a Masonic Temple was Masonic Hall. This began to change in the mid 19th Century when the larger Masonic Halls most often found in major cities began to be named with the term Masonic Temple. As time went on more and more American buildings began using the name Masonic Temple regardless of their size or location.&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"/&gt; In US Freemasonry today the term Masonic Hall is experiencing a revival motivated in part by the public misconception that Masons conduct a form of religious worship in their Temples.&lt;ref name="Hodapp, Christopher 2005. p.95"&gt;Hodapp, Christopher. Freemasons for Dummies. Indianapolis: Wiley, 2005. p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Though Masonic Temples in their most basic definition serve as a home to a Masonic Lodge they can also serve many other purposes as well. Smaller Masonic Temples will often consist of nothing more than a meeting room with a kitchen/dining area attached.  Larger Masonic Temples can contain multiple meeting rooms, concert halls, libraries, and museums as well as non-masonic commercial and office space.&lt;ref&gt;Lundberg, Alex and Greg Kowalski (2006). Detroit's Masonic Temple. Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7385-4034-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:WashDCMasonic2007.jpg|thumb|The Masonic [[House of the Temple]] of the Scottish Rite, Washington, DC, [[John Russell Pope]], architect, 1911–15, another scholarly version.]]
Since their inception the proper design of a Masonic Temple has been a serious subject debate among Masonic scholars. And because of that ongoing debate a number of different standards have been proposed throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, A: ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: And Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts, Sciences and Literature As Connected With the Institution'', page 315. Moss &amp; Co., 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts at standardization, Masonic Temples often vary widely in design.  Even the layout of the lodge room will differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für ethnologische Forschung'')  is located in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in 1999, and moved into new buildings 2001. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]].

==Organization==
The institute currently consists of three departments. Likewise, the MPISA co-manages the Center for Anthropological Studies on Central Asia with the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology of the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2949654/research|title=Research|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Anthropology===
Headed by Prof. Dr. Marie-Claire Foblets, the Department of Law and Anthropology was established in 2012 to focus on the effects of societies and cultures towards law and politics and vice versa. This department also carefully looks how scholars of this specific discipline can and should take responsibility for implications surrounding the interplay of these societal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2951631/department_foblets|title=Department 'Law &amp; Anthropology'|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resilience and Transformation in Eurasia===
Headed by Prof. Dr. [[Chris Hann]], the Department of Resilience and Transformation in Eurasia is concerned with the interaction of economics, politics and anthropology within [[Eurasia]]. Research sub-groups are focusing and have done studies on [[kinship]], [[historical anthropology]], [[economic anthropology]], urban anthropology, culture and socialism, and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2952223/department_hann|title=Department 'Resilience and Transformation in Eurasia'|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration and Conflict===
Headed by Prof. Dr. Günther Schlee, the Department of Integration and Conflict focuses on social systems particularly based on identification and differentiation among groups. The department looks into the holistic elements that build [[ethnic identity]] through kinship, friendship, language, history, religion, and how ethnicity plays a role across social systems at individual and supra-individual levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2952301/department_schlee|title=Department 'Integration and Conflict'|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology is mainly represented by the following people:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2946959/structure|title=Structure|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2017, the Department of Law and Anthropology has invited the controversial American activist and political scientist [[Norman Finkelstein]] as a visiting scholar. The Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology has thus been criticized for providing a platform for a controversial speaker. In a statement the Max Planck Institute said that the purpose of Finkelstein's invitation to the Institute was to engage in a dialogue with him to discuss his work within an academic context. The research institute is dedicated to basic research where controversy cannot be ruled out; controversy is a “trait of academic work”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/4315846/news_2017_01_18_01|title=Statement on the invitation of Norman Finkelstein as visiting scholar January 16, 2017, January 18, 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MegaTransect''' was the name for a project conducted in Africa in 1999 by [[J. Michael Fay]] to spend 455 days on the expedition hike of 2000 miles across the [[Congo Basin]] of [[Africa]] to survey the ecological and environmental status of the region.

A transect is a term in ecology that denotes a survey of the natural vegetation through a particular area. The concept of a megatransect was conceived as a vegetation transect on a large scale that could be used to take an ecological census of the natural vegetation and ecosystems.

Shortly after the hike, Fay successfully lobbied alongside the President of [[Gabon]] to create 13 new [[national park]]s.  In 2002, US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and other Bush Administration members gave 53 million dollars to help preserve the Congo Basin.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Mike Fay later went on to carry out the [[MegaFlyover]] in 2004.

==[[Madagascar]] megatransect==

Also in 2004, an international team conducted a "Megatransect" of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Dubbed "Hike Madagascar", the journey covered the entire island.  Members met with rural farmers to help them improve their agricultural techniques and discuss their impact on the environment.

==History of USA megatransects==
One of the first megatransects in the [[United States]], was conducted by Dr. Robert R. Humphrey when he rephotographed 535 miles of the natural vegetation along the United States and Mexico border at the 1890s permanent border monument locations, spaced about five miles apart, and published the work in "90 Years and 535 miles: Vegetation Changes along the Mexican Border" (1987, pub. Univ. of NM Press, 448 pages).

Craig C. Dremann, in 1997, conducted a megatransect surveying over 3,000 miles and at each mile-marker, noting the roadside vegetation, the perennial native [[grass]], and [[Invasive species|exotic grass]] status, through the [[Great Basin]] ecosystem.  The route was from [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada eastward to [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], South Dakota, and from South Dakota, through Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and returning westward to [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], California, and then north to Reno.

In 2005, Dremann conducted another vegetation megatransect, this time of the California portion of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave desert]], mapping over 1,000 miles on a mile-by-mile basis, for a fast-spreading exotic [[Mustard plant|mustard]] species, [[Brassica]] [[Brassica tournefortii|tournefortii]], noting the locations and density of the [[Mojave desert Mustard infestation in California]].

Dremann suggests that a method of remotely conducting a large-scale vegetation megatransect, is with photographs. Photographs that have been taken at ground-level at intervals from known locations, can be stitched together, to create large-scale to Continent-scale megatransect pictures of the ecosystems.

In 2006, Dr. Michael C. McGrann, and his wife Amy M. McGrann, hiked the length of the California section of Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) in the western United States from Mexico to the Oregon border (2,736&amp;nbsp;km) while systematically collecting avian-habitat data on 3,578 survey plots separated by 10-minute hiking intervals. This work was completed in a single field season from 2 April to 8 September. From this data, Dr. McGrann and his collaborators described the elevation and latitudinal distributions of birds along the PCT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistically modeled avian species richness relationships with elevation, climate, and environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Tingley|first2=Morgan|last3=Elliott-Fisk|first3=Deborah|last4=Thorne|first4=James|last5=McGrann|first5=Amy|title=Heterogeneity in avian richness-environment relationships along the Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Avian Conservation and Ecology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=2|page=8|url=http://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss2/art8/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from this work show that birds can exhibit heterogeneous relationships to temperature, precipitation, and productivity, depending on the distinct environmental and climate conditions of each of the ecological regions traversed by the PCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCT Mega-transect is an ongoing research project for Dr. McGrann in collaboration with several other researchers. He has continued his biodiversity surveys along sections of the PCT in 2007, 2010, and 2015, and he is working to expand taxa surveyed along the PCT and to involve his undergraduate students at William Jessup University in the [http://www.jessup.edu/academics/environmental-science/#tab_research PCT Mega-Transect].

In 2007-2008 J. Michael Fay and Lindsey Holm completed a 1300 mile [http://www.redwoodtransect.org Redwood Transect] of 333 days.  This was a transect that spanned from the southernmost to the northernmost redwood tree in California and Oregon.  They walked extensively on private timberland and public land recording data on historical exploitation, current forest stand characteristics, silviculture and many other aspects of the redwood ecosystem.  The results will be published in National Geographic in 2009.

The [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] and the [[National Park Service]] are adapting the idea of a megatransect for the [[Appalachian Trail]] (A.T.) Like other megatransects, the [http://www.appalachiantrail.org/megatransect A.T. MEGA-Transect] aims to monitor the natural resources along the trail, understand the status and trends of these resources, and inform and engage the public and stakeholders. The 2,178 mile long trail crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine, and is visited by one to two million people, and completed by about 400 people each year. Volunteer citizen scientists are beginning to implement monitoring protocols to track natural resources such as wildlife presence, water quality, forest health, invasive plants, endangered species, mountain birds, phenology, and air quality. Professional scientists are also using the transect for independent research. Because the A.T. is oriented along the predicted migratory direction of species responding to climate change, it is a particularly important megatransect to establish and maintain.

==MegaTransect future==
For a rapidly changing planet, megatransects establish baseline [[data]] from which to draw future trends, and they can focus attention on particular ecosystems which are disappearing faster than others.

Establishing standard megatransects on specific [[region]]s or through various ecosystems of each continent, and periodic re&amp;ndash;measurement of the ecological conditions along routes, every five to ten years, would provide very valuable measured data on environmental trends.

'''Michael C. Mitchell''' (born January 4, 1946 in [[Portland, Oregon]]) is an American planner, designer, lecturer and environmentalist. His work focuses primarily on the planning and design of destinations, attractions, leisure and [[rural development]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaub &amp; Williams, Published in SW Law, Wednesday, 14 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==MCM Group International==

MCM Group is an international planning and design firm headquartered in [[Los Angeles]]. Founded in 1984 by Michael C. Mitchell after the close of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympic Games]], where he served as the head of planning and operations, the firm has sought to expand those planning techniques as a model to address prominent social problems.&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015. Installation view at Palazzo Mora, 2016. The collection of Time Space Existence – Biennale Architectura 2016&lt;/ref&gt; MCM Group provides feasibility consulting, planning, architecture, landscape design and sustainable engineering services. Mitchell has developed offices in [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], Middle East offices in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], an African base in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] and currently four offices in China, with its headquarters in [[Beijing]].

==Earlier career==

At [[Portland State University]], Mitchell became one of the organizers of the First [[Earth Day]] in 1970, coordinating universities throughout America's northwest states.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} After his work on the First [[Earth Day]], he was one of ten university students selected from across the nation by President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration to form a national Youth Advisory Board on environmental matters, S.C.O.P.E (Student Council on Pollution and the Environment)&lt;ref&gt;Flippen, J. Brooks, "Nixon and the Environment," University of New Mexico Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned to the [[U.S. Department of Interior]] where Mitchell was a reviewer on the creation of the first [[Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS).

Mitchell continued his work with what became the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]](EPA), writing an environmental education program for students{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games==

In the early 1980s Mitchell was recruited by the [[Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee]], where he served as the Group Vice-President of Planning and Control (Finance). Among his duties included overseeing the planning of the Olympic venues and supervising the architectural department's venue planning. During the Olympics he was responsible for the Games Operations Center and oversaw the closeout of the Games after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;Shaub &amp; Williams, Published in SW Law, Wednesday, 14 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015.

He has since served as a senior planning consultant to six other Olympic Games and four World Fairs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==LA84 Foundation==

As head of the close-out operations after the completion of the Los Angeles [[1984 Summer Olympics]], Mitchell oversaw the creation of the [[LA84 Foundation]] which was formed out of the $225 million surplus from the operations of the Games. The Foundation is now a national leader in supporting youth programs, providing recreation and learning opportunities to disadvantaged youth, training youth coaches and convening national conferences on youth sports issues.&lt;ref&gt;LA84 Foundation and the Legacy of the 1984 Olympics, "L.A. Summer Games were a risk that is still paying off," Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Live Aid==

In the Spring of 1985, Mitchell was contacted by [[Bob Geldof]], an English rock musician, that had been working on issues of drought and famine in [[Africa]]. Geldof asked Mitchell to produce a worldwide televised music show to raise funds to help alleviate the catastrophic consequences of the worst African famine in a century.

Mitchell became the Executive Producer of the worldwide [[Live Aid]] broadcast (under a newly formed venture Worldwide Sports and Entertainment)&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Live Aid Foundation in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Medium (website)]], medium.com/@liveaid1985/live-aid-responding-to-the-critics -"The Day The Music Changed The World: Live Aid was a multi-venue rock music concert held on July 13, 1985," Published Nov 18, 2014, retrieved November 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 13, 1985 broadcast was the world's first large globally interactive show seen by 1.5 billion viewers in 150 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michael, Rolling Stones, 8/15/ 1985, "Live Aid 1985: The Day the World Rocked, an expression of musicians' concern for the starving of Ethiopia, this was the biggest concert ever"&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] utilized three satellites to beam from one location around the world, [[Live Aid]] utilized thirteen satellites sending and receiving concerts from seven locations from around the world and producing one international feed back to the 150 nations. Despite 1985 being at the height of the [[Cold War]], Mitchell established a global broadcast with a live concert from the [[Soviet Union]] featuring [[Autograph]], and a delayed Live Aid showing in China.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Medium (website)]], medium.com/@liveaid1985/live-aid-responding-to-the-critics - "The Day The Music Changed The World: Live Aid was a multi-venue rock music concert held on July 13, 1985," Published Nov 18, 2014, retrieved November 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michael, Rolling Stones, 8/15/ 1985, "Live Aid 1985: The Day the World Rocked, an expression of musicians' concern for the starving of Ethiopia, this was the biggest concert ever"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Esther B., New York Times, July 14, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Live Aid 1985, "A Day of Magic," CNN, May 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medium, "The Day The Music Changed The World," November 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teltsch, Kathleen, "Live Aid Turns to Plans for Future", N.Y.

President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Administration supported the Live Aid Foundation by providing wheat from America's reserves and awarded Mitchell a Presidential Citation for the Live Aid Foundation's contributions to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/document-Live-Aid-Foundation.jpg, retrieved 11/26/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFIE==

Mitchell continued his contributions to social and education programs by accepting an appointment to the Board of the National Education Association's Foundation for the Improvement of Education (NFIE), serving on the board from 1987 – 1997. Since its beginning in 1969, the Foundation has served as a laboratory of learning, offering funding and other resources to public school educators, their schools, and districts to solve complex teaching and learning challenges&lt;ref&gt;Marple, Jorea M., An Insider's Guide to making School Systems Work, The Scarecrow Press Inc., Lanham, Maryland and Oxford, 2002, pp149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NFIE_0001.pdf, retrieved 11/26/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund for Democracy and Development==

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union starting in 1990, Russia and Ukraine experienced a severe shortage of medical and food supplies. Working throughout both countries witnessing first-hand the growing crisis, Mitchell and his close friend, Yankel Ginzburg, an American artist and humanitarian, who had family in Tver, Russia, responded to requests by Russia's leadership for assistance, co-founding the "Fund for Democracy and Development" to provide aid to alleviate the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, Herman, "The Art and Life of Yankel Ginzburg," 1994 pp 16, 61, 62, Library of Congress catalogue C872-1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell served as the founding board chairman in 1991 and L. Ronald Scheman (co-founder of the [[Pan American Development Foundation]], where his work included providing financial assistance to low-income rural communities), served as the first President. Past President [[Richard M. Nixon]] served as the honorary chairman of the Fund.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, May 29, 1992, "Nixon to Lead Relief Group Visiting Russia and Ukraine"&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1994 the Fund is credited with channeling 240 million dollars worth of staples and food supplies to the former Soviet Union. As gratitude for the contributions of the Fund, the Russian government commissioned a monument park to reflect American goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, Herman, "The Art and Life of Yankel Ginzburg," 1994 pp 16, 61, 62, Library of Congress catalogue C872-1918&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amur Tiger Sanctuary==

With offices established in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Mitchell contributed to several rural development and environmental projects across the former Soviet Union. Mitchell's planning of development projects in rural Russia included work in Siberia on sustainable resource and forest management practices.

While undertaking those projects in conjunction with local wildlife scientists Mitchell convinced the Prime Minister of Russia, [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], to establish the [[Amur Tiger]] Sanctuary in 1993, which was initially funded through the Global Survival Network (GSN), an environmental organization he co-founded with Steve Galster now of [[Freeland Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeland.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanctuary included introducing armed ranger patrols to stop the threat that poachers played in the region. The initial work that Mitchell and the Executive Director of GSN, Steve Galster, did to establish the sanctuary was soon funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), now known as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], and is currently carried out with the support of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Russia)]]. As a result of this work, the wild Siberian Tiger population has rebounded from their critical endangered level.&lt;ref&gt;WWF Russia, Protection of Siberian Tiger and its Habitat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposing animal and human trafficking==

In order to strengthen the Sanctuary efforts to stop poaching, Mitchell worked with Steve Galster conducting undercover video interviews with the poachers. Through these undercover meetings, he and Galster discovered a link between animal poachers and human traffickers. What began as an effort to preserve habitat became an international exposé on trafficking. From 1995-1997 they undertook a two-year undercover investigation personally holding meetings with traffickers and trafficked women to expose the international relationship between animal and human trafficking.

Information and undercover video derived from their investigation were used to create a GSN written report, "Crime &amp; Servitude"&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Gillian, Author, "Crime &amp; Servitude: An Exposé of the Traffic in Women for Prostitution from the Newly Independent States," Publisher, Global Survival Network (1997), ASIN: B0006QTIII&lt;/ref&gt; and a video documentary, "Bought &amp; Sold."&lt;ref&gt;GSN (Global Survival Network) footage for "Bought &amp; Sold: An Investigative Documentary about the International Trade in Women, " 1995-1998, Texas Archival Resources Online&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in 1997 and received widespread media coverage in the US and abroad, including specials on ABC Primetime Live, CNN, and BBC.

The documentary also helped to catalyze legislative reform on trafficking as well as new financial resources to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas Libraries, The Riche Media Collection, 3209 B01550, latest revision as of 14:55, 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Galster took what was learned during that undercover period and continues this work, founding the [[Freeland Foundation]], which is the lead implementing partner of Asia's Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeland.org/arrest/&lt;/ref&gt; a program sponsored by the U.S. government in partnership with [[ASEAN]] and over fifty governmental and non-governmental organizations.

The material that was collected during those two years is housed at the Human Rights Documentation Initiative (HRDI), The University of Texas at Austin

==United Nations Day of Tolerance==

Beginning in 1985, Mitchell began an association with Irving Sarnoff, the Executive Director of Friends of the United Nations (FOTUN), and his co-Founder, Dr. Noel Brown, Director of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), North America. The Friends of the United Nations is an NGO dedicated to advocating support for programs of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;"International Instruments of the United Nations," adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, 1945-1995, compiled and Edited by Irving Sarnoff, Founder: Friends of the United Nations, United nations Publications, {{ISBN|92-1-100612-0}}, Copyright United nations, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their work on international social issues Mitchell was asked to create a celebration for the United Nations [[International Day for Tolerance]] in 1999. The International Day for Tolerance is an annual observation declared by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 to generate public awareness of the dangers of intolerance.

Mitchell organized the 1999 event honoring [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], former leader of the Soviet Union and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], actor, politician and Chairman of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute of State and Global Policy. Keynote speakers included [[John Kerry]], U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Secretary General Statements and Messages, SG/SM/7213, OBV/123, "Struggle for Tolerance is Struggle for Humanity Itself" 15 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural development==

One of the first projects integrating agricultural development, sustainability, community and social values, and economic growth was in a region of [[Qingdao, China]] where his company, MCM Group, brought international blueberry agricultural experts to develop what is considered now one of the world's largest blueberry farms (The Qingdao Cangma Mountain Development).&lt;ref&gt;GAA Foundation: "MCM Group International, Cangma Mountain Development, 2015" Installation view at Palazzo Mora, 2016. The collection of Time Space Existence – Biennale Architectura 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The project  included hi-technology organic agriculture, agritourism, educational programs, local culture and residential development to provide the local rural community with a successful economic transition.

'''''Monmouthshire Houses: A Study of Building Techniques and Smaller House-Plans in the Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries''''' is a study of buildings within the county of [[Monmouthshire]] written by [[Cyril Fox|Sir Cyril Fox]] and [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] and published by [[Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]]. The study was published in three volumes; ''Part I Medieval Houses'', ''Part II Sub-Medieval Houses, c. 1550–1610'' and ''Part III Renaissance Houses, c. 1590–1714'', between 1951 and 1954. The series was republished by Merton Priory Press in 1994. A later historian of Welsh architecture has described the work as equal in importance, in its own field, to [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. 

==History==
Sir Cyril Fox (1882–1967), was Director of the National Museum of Wales from 1926 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-FOX0-FRE-1882.html |title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography |publisher=Yba.llgc.org.uk |date=1967-01-16 |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Fitzroy Somerset, Lord Raglan]], the great-grandson of [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|the 1st Lord Raglan]], British Commander during the [[Crimean War]], was a soldier, author and resident of [[Cefntilla Court]] in Monmouthshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/15/archives/lord-raglan-79-dies-in-wales-a-soldier-author-and-historian.html|title=Lord Raglan, 79, Dies in Wales; A Soldier, Author and Historian; Ex‐Grenadier Guards Officer Eladed Slave Traders — Attacked literary Myths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raglan was also a Commissioner for [[Scheduled monument|Ancient Monuments]] in Wales and both he and Fox were pioneers of the study of [[vernacular architecture]], being founder members of the Vernacular Architecture Group. From the early 1940s until 1949, Fox and Raglan undertook the most extensive survey of lesser Monmouthshire buildings ever undertaken.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} Raglan described their methodology in the introduction to the first volume, ''Medieval Houses'', published in 1951. He would identify houses of interest and obtain the necessary permissions from owners, before calling in Fox to undertake a detailed survey.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} In the Introduction to the 1994 reprint, Peter Smith, author of ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', recorded Raglan's approach; "as we travelled from farmhouse to farmhouse, I realised that his was a name that carried weight and in Monmouthshire opened every door...status and personal charm carried the day and we followed in his wake".{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iii}} The architectural historian, [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]], author of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Pevsner]] for Monmouthshire, considered Fox and Raglan's joint work as "ground-breaking, the single most important publication on any aspect of the county's buildings",{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}} and Smith described ''Monmouthshire Houses'' as "this landmark in the history of scholarship, a landmark, in its own field, as significant as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[Origin of Species]]''".{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}}

In the Introduction to ''Sub-Medieval Houses'', the second volume of their history, Fox and Raglan record the genesis of the project. Wartime defensive precautions in 1941 led to a decision by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] to demolish an important farmhouse, Upper Wern-hir, near [[Llanbadoc]]. Fox and Raglan obtained permission to survey the building before its destruction and their investigations, together with the threats to Wern-hir and other, similar, buildings, convinced them of the need for a comprehensive survey of such structures throughout Monmouthshire.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994b|pp=15–16}}

==Description==
The three-volume work comprises detailed studies of over 400 houses and farmhouses built in Monmouthshire between the [[medieval]] period and 1714.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994a|loc=preface}} The volumes are:

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

'''''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England''''' is a study of several [[Wicca]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that assembled in southern England during the 1980s. It was written by the American anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] (1959–) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], and first published in 1989.

The work would be criticized by later academics working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] and [[western esotericism]], who charged it with dealing with those it was studying in a derogatory manner.

== Influence==
Writing in her paper within [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]' edited ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft'' anthology, Siân Reid described Luhrmann's work as "a solid ethnography". Nevertheless, she felt that the study "occasionally rings hollow" because Luhrmann failed to take into account the "subjective motivations for magical practice".{{sfn|Reid|1996|pp=146&amp;ndash;147}}
In her anthropological study of the U.S. Pagan community, ''[[Witching Culture]]'' (2004), the American academic [[Sabina Magliocco]] noted that her work both built upon and departed from Luhrmann's.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political law comprises [[election law]], [[suffrage|voting rights]] law, [[campaign finance]] law, laws governing [[lobbying]] and lobbyists, [[open government]] laws, legislative and executive branch [[ethical code|ethics codes]], [[parliamentary procedure|legislative procedure]], [[administrative law|administrative procedure]], [[constitutional law]], and legislative and regulatory drafting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021001140/http://politicallawgroup.com/OurServices Political Law Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |title=Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law |publisher=Econcordia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312155927/http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political laws are applied primarily to government officials, candidates, [[advocacy group]]s, [[lobbying|lobbyists]], [[business]]es, [[nonprofit organization]]s, and [[trade union]]s.

At the federal level, the [[Federal Election Commission]] enforces campaign finance law with respect to races for the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate]], and the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns for federal office are subject to contribution limits and certain contributions are prohibited.  The [http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pin/ Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section (PIN)] has jurisdiction involving alleged criminal violations of many political laws.

At the state level, most states have administrative agencies to enforce state law with respect to campaign finance and ethics rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=15331/ |title=National Conference of State Legislatures list of state ethics commissions |publisher=Ncsl.org |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general of the state may also play a role in enforcement. Some local governments also maintain ethics agencies. At the state and local level these agencies might simply provide for disclosure of campaign finance registration and reporting forms (or lobbyist registration and reporting), or they may provide an enforcement scheme.

"Pay-to-play" restrictions are an example of political law.  For instance, in the context of municipal securities dealers, rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board effectively prohibit certain individuals from contributing to the political funds of officials of issuers.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37.

The '''Michigan Population Studies Center''' is a '''[[demography]]''' center in the United States, with an extensive record in both domestic and international population research and training.

== History &amp; Research Focus ==

The [[University of Michigan]]'s Population Studies Center (PSC) was established in 1961, originally as a unit within the Department of Sociology. The Center has had close connections to the Department of Economics since 1966. The Center has become increasingly interdisciplinary over time, drawing faculty from [[Anthropology]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]], [[Natural Resources]], [[Political Science]], [[Psychology]], [[Public Health]], Public Policy, [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], and [[Statistics]]. The energy and intellectual curiosity of the Center's researchers, fostered by the strong support environment and leavened by their interaction with visitors and students at all levels, is a major source of Center momentum.

The PSC comprises independent population researchers who pursue their own agendas with the support of the PSC staff. A large portfolio of both domestic and international research is supported by the Center. The Center focuses on several [http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/research/ key areas of demographic research], which can be grouped into several major areas: 
1) Families, Fertility &amp; Children; 2) Health, Disability &amp; Mortality; 3) Human Capital, Labor &amp; Wealth; 4) [[Aging]]; 5) [[Population dynamics]]; 6) Inequality &amp; Group Disparities; 7) Methodology.

== Organization and Administration ==

The Center made a major institutional move in July 1998, from the College of Literature, Science, and Arts into the Institute for Social Research (ISR). The merger into ISR facilitates close integration between the PSC's demographic research and the long tradition in survey methodology and major data collection projects at ISR. PSC becomes the fourth center in ISR, joining the Survey Research Center, the Center for Political Studies, and the Research Center for Group Dynamics.

The Center provides administrative and support services to researchers through three core units: Administrative Services, Computing Services, and Information Services., The Administrative Core provides management and administrative support for Research Associates and their funded research projects. The Computing Core provides a state-of-the-art social science computing environment to support the Center's research and training missions. The Information Services Core provides resources and services in three broad areas. Data Services maintains a collection of demographic data files that are routinely used by Center researchers and assists in the acquisition, organization, and management of data for PSC research projects. Library Services maintains a collection of local holdings and assists researchers in collecting information from University libraries and in doing demographic library research using traditional and electronic resources. The Communications Office provides editorial services and disseminates research results through the production of working papers and web sites.

== Graduate and Postdoctoral Training ==

The Population Studies Center provides apprenticeship training and fellowship support to graduate students in Sociology, Economics, Public Health, and Anthropology who choose demography as a field of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/training/ Training program in demography]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the graduate training program is to produce social scientists, fully trained in their discipline, with broad knowledge in population studies and specialized skills in statistical and demographic techniques, who can undertake independent research on a wide range of population topics. In the apprenticeship program student trainees gain practical research experience under the supervision of a professional staff member. The Center does not award graduate degrees. All graduate students associated with the Center are admitted into department Ph.D. programs and earn their degrees in those programs. The Center also provides postdoctoral training to demographic researchers in a variety of fields.

== PSC Financial Support ==

The PSC was established with funding from the Ford Foundation, and received continued support from the Ford Foundation for over 20 years. Since 1976 the Center has been supported by a population center grant (R24 HD041028) from the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health. This center grant provides core infrastructure support for the Center's research activities. NICHD center grant support continues to be the major source of funding for the Center's cores. The Center also collaborates with the Survey Research Center of ISR in operating the [http://micda.psc.isr.umich.edu/ Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA)], funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), also part of the National Institutes of Health. Additional support for PSC's international research and training activities is provided by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">'''Roughness length''' (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[parameter]] of some vertical wind profile equations that model the horizontal mean wind speed near the ground; in the [[log wind profile]], it is equivalent to the height at which the wind speed theoretically becomes zero. In reality the wind at this height no longer follows a mathematical logarithm. It is so named because it is typically related to the height of terrain roughness elements. Whilst it is not a physical length, it can be considered as a length-scale representation of the roughness of the surface.

==Application==
As an approximation, the roughness length is approximately one-tenth of the height of the surface roughness elements. For example, short grass of height 0.01m has a roughness length of approximately 0.001m. Surfaces are rougher if they have more protrusions. Forests have much larger roughness lengths than tundra, for example. Roughness length is an important concept in [[urban meteorology]] as the building of tall structures, such as skyscrapers, has an effect on roughness length and wind patterns.

In contemporary [[mereology]], a '''simple''' is any thing that has no proper parts. Sometimes the term "atom" is used, although in recent years{{when?|date=January 2010}} the term "simple" has become the standard. 

Simples are to be contrasted with [[Gunk (mereology)|atomless gunk]] (where something is "gunky" if it is such that every proper part has a further proper part). Necessarily, given the definitions, everything is either composed of simples, gunk or a mixture of the two. Classical mereology is consistent with both the existence of gunk and either finite or infinite simples (see Hodges and Lewis 1968).

Given a mereology containing the [[null individual]], no object other than the null individual would be simple.

==The Simple Question==
Mirroring the [[special composition question]] is the Simple Question.&lt;ref&gt;Markosian 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It asks what the jointly necessary and sufficient conditions are for ''x'' to be a mereological simple. In the literature this question explicitly concerns what it is for a material object to lack proper parts, although there is no reason why similar questions cannot be asked of things from other [[ontological]] categories.

There have been many suggested answers to the Simple Question. Answers include that ''x'' is a simple if and only it is a point-sized object; that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is indivisible; or that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is maximally continuous. Kris McDaniel has argued that what it is for an object to be a simple is a matter of brute fact, and that there is no non-trivial answer to the Simple Question (2007b).

==Extended simples==
Of those philosophers who believe the material world contains simples, there has recently been debate over whether there can be extended simples (see Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006, Markosian 1998, 2004, McDaniel 2007a, 2007b, McKinnon 2003, Parsons 2000, Sider 2006, Simons 2004 ''inter alia''). An extended simple is (i) a material object; (ii) simple, and (iii) it occupies an extended region of space.

Various reasons have been offered in favor of the claim that extended simples are possible, including: (a) that they are conceivable (Markosian 1998), (b) that purportedly plausible modal principles claiming, roughly, that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences [[logical consequence|entail]] their possibility (McDaniel 2007a, Saucedo 2009, Sider 2006), and (c) that contemporary physical theories entail that there are extended simples (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006). One might also argue in favor of the possibility of extended simples by noting that their existence is consistent with the answer to the Simple Question one endorses. In the literature, however, the reasoning is often reversed: Those who think that extended simples are possible often use their purported possibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail their impossibility and those who think that they are impossible uses their purported impossibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail (or strongly suggest) their possibility.

There have been arguments against extended simples. Arguments include variants on Lewis' argument from temporary intrinsics, as well as arguments that intuitively an extended object must have, for instance, a right half and a left half, and thus have parts (cf Zimmerman 1996: 10) Similarly, one who endorses the [[Doctrine of Arbitrarily Undetatched Parts]], which states that necessarily, if an object occupies region ''R'' then every occupiable proper sub-region of ''R'' is exactly occupied by a proper part of that object (see van Inwagen 1981), might use that principle in an argument against the possibility of extended simples.

If there are no extended simples, the only remaining options would material objects being made of unextended simples (objects that have a space-time extension of 0) or atomless gunk.

Some philosophers seem to have held that the whole universe is one enormous extended simple. According to some interpretations of Descartes and Spinoza, for instance, they held this view. More recently, this view has been defended in Schaffer 2007.

==Non-material simples==
The use of 'simple' is not restricted to material objects. Anything, no matter what ontological category it is from, is a simple if and only if it has no proper parts. Thus Lewis has argued that singletons are simples (Lewis 1991) and spacetime points are often thought to be simples (although in some non-standard spacetimes, points have proper parts). Similarly, there is a question of whether things from other categories--for instance, fictional characters and properties, if there are such things--are simples. Furthermore, just as every material object may be made of atomless gunk rather than simples, so too for objects from other ontological categories. For instance, some have held that spacetime is gunky, claiming that every region of spacetime has a proper sub-region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">'''Spent caustic''' is a waste industrial [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] solution that has become exhausted and is no longer useful (or spent). Spent caustics are made of [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], [[water]], and contaminants.  The contaminants have consumed the majority of the sodium (or potassium) hydroxide and thus the caustic liquor is spent, for example, in one common application [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (''gas'')]] is [[scrubber|scrubbed]] by the [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH (''aqueous'')]] to form NaHS (''aq'') and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''l''), thus consuming the caustic.

==Types==
* '''Ethylene spent caustic''' comes from the caustic scrubbing of cracked gas from an [[ethylene]] [[cracking (chemistry)|cracker]].  This liquor is produced by a caustic scrubbing tower.  Ethylene product gas is contaminated with {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) and {{CO2}}(g), and those contaminants are removed by absorption in the caustic scrubbing tower to produce {{chem|NaHS}}(aq) and {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}(aq). The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewater (ethylene spent caustic) is contaminated with the sulfides and carbonates and a small fraction of organic compounds.
*'''Refinery spent caustic''' comes from multiple sources: the [[Merox]] processing of [[gasoline]]; the Merox processing of [[kerosene]]/[[jet fuel]]; and the caustic scrubbing/Merox processing of [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. In these streams sulfides and organic acids are removed from the product streams into the caustic phase. The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewaters (cresylic for gasoline; naphthenic for kerosene/jet fuel; sulfidic for LPG -spent caustics) are often mixed and called '''refinery spent caustic'''. This spent caustic is contaminated with sulfides, carbonates, and in many cases a high fraction of heavy [[organic acids]].

==Treatment technologies==
Spent caustics are malodorous [[wastewater]]s that are difficult to treat in conventional [[wastewater]] processes. Typically the material is disposed of by high [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] with [[biotreatment]], deep well injection, [[incineration]], [[wet air oxidation]], [[Humid Peroxide Oxidation]] or other speciality processes. Most ethylene spent caustics are disposed of through wet air oxidation.

[[File:Egyptian appliqué at Textile Research Centre, Leiden.jpg|thumb|Egyptian appliqué]]

The '''Textile Research Centre (TRC),''' [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], is an independent research institute working in the field of [[Textile|textiles]] and [[Clothing|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trc-leiden.nl|title=Textile Research Centre, Leiden|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed at Hogewoerd 164 in Leiden and includes exhibition space, storage rooms, a lecture room and other working areas. The current director of the TRC (per November 2010) is Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood, a textile and dress historian.

==Aims==
The TRC has the stated aim of encouraging research into [[wiktionary:anthropological|anthropological]] and [[wiktionary:archaeological|archaeological]] textiles and clothing in the widest sense of the word. In particular, the TRC specialises in dress - what people wear in order to express their identity - and pre-industrial textile technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General information |url=https://www.trc-leiden.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=103&amp;Itemid=118&amp;lang=en |website=www.trc-leiden.nl |accessdate=8 September 2018 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The TRC was founded in 1991 as a ''[[Stichting]]'' (foundation; [[wiktionary:non-profit|non-profit]] organisation). Since then it has been involved in many aspects of the academic study of [[wiktionary:textiles|textiles]] and dress, especially those from the [[Near East]].

In 1997 the TRC started building up a textile and dress collection. By late 2010 the collection had grown to over 6,500 textiles, garments and accessories from all over the world. Most of the garments come from the Near East and [[Islamic]] lands: notably, [[Afghanistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Oman]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. It also has a large collection of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] regional dress. Many of the garments were obtained during fieldwork by TRC staff and students, whilst others were purchased or given as donations.

Until August 2009 the TRC was housed in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]], Leiden, but since then it has moved to new premises in the centre of Leiden. It now organises a series of exhibitions, lectures, workshops and training courses for students and others who are interested. Recent exhibitions included: ''Embroidery from the Arab World'' (2009–2010)&lt;ref name=embroidery /&gt; and ''Well-Dressed Afghanistan'' (2010–2011).&lt;ref name=afghanistan /&gt;

Middle Eastern dress remains a focal point of the TRC. The veils in the TRC collection, for instance, were used for a major exhibition at the National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden (1996), and for various publications, including ''Covering the Moon: An Introduction to Middle Eastern Face Veils''.&lt;ref name=vogelsang2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vogelsang-Eastwood |first1=Gillian |last2=Vogelsang |first2=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6163">'''The Oceanography Society''' ('''TOS''') is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] society founded in 1988, based in [[Rockville, Maryland]], U.S. and incorporated in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="oceanography1.1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=D. James|title=How the Oceanography Society Came to Be: Its Past and its Future|journal=[[Oceanography (journal)|Oceanography]]|year=1988|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/1_1/1.1_baker.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2010|publisher=Oceanography Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[oceanography|oceanographical]] organization that aims to promote communication among oceanographers, spread knowledge through research and education, and to provide a constituency for building consensus amongst the sub-disciplines of the field. The society publishes the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Oceanography (journal)|Oceanography]]'', which publishes articles on all oceanic disciplines.&lt;ref name="ocea-main"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tos.org/|title=Oceanography Society|publisher=Oceanography Society|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The idea for forming an oceanographic society was hatched by a group of scientists, who approached both the [[American Geophysical Union]] and the [[American Meteorological Society]] with the idea. The two groups both responded positively, leading to several oceanographical events at the time. However, the need developed for the creation of an independent community, resulting in the formation of the Oceanography Society in March 1988. These early developments by the society were paralleled by developments in the [[Challenger Society for Marine Science]].&lt;ref name="oceanography1.1" /&gt;

== Awards ==

The Oceanography Society gives out three awards—the Jerlov Award, the Walter Munk Award, and the Oceanography Society Fellows Program.&lt;ref name="ocea-awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tos.org/awardshonors|title= Awards and Honors|publisher=Oceanography Society|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jerlov Award ===

The Jerlov Award is awarded by the society biennially "in recognition of the contribution made to the advancement of our knowledge of the nature and consequences of light in the ocean" and to "recognize outstanding achievements in ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing research".&lt;ref name="ocea-jerlov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tos.org/jerlov-award|title=The Jerlov Award|publisher=Oceanography Society|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is named after [[Nils Jerlov|Nils Gunnar Jerlov]], an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. Jerlov's work on ocean optical and other similar processes helped to create modern ocean optical research. His book ''[[Marine Optics]]'', published in 1976, is still widely referenced by other sources and is read by students of ocean optics and ocean color sensing.&lt;ref name="ocea-jerlov"/&gt;

=== Oceanography Society Fellows Program ===

The Fellows Program "recognizes individuals who have attained eminence in oceanography through their outstanding contributions to the field of oceanography or its applications during a substantial period of years".&lt;ref name="ocea-fellow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tos.org/awards_honors/fellows_program.html|title=The Oceanography Society Fellows Program|publisher=Oceanography Society|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals in the Society can be elected as a TOS Fellow with outstanding contributions to the field of oceanography as well as devotion to the field. An individual is usually considered for nomination after he or she has been a member of the society for at least three years.&lt;ref name="ocea-fellow" /&gt;

== Journal ==

{{Main|Oceanography (journal)}}

''Oceanography'' is published quarterly—every March, June, September, and December.&lt;ref name="ocea-main" /&gt; It contains [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles on many aspects of ocean science. The journal was first published in 1988; all of its issues are available both in print and online as PDF files.&lt;ref name="ocea-journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/|title=''Oceanography'': Home|publisher=Oceanography Society|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Saga of Recluce''''' is a series of [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s written by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]]. The initial novel in the series, ''The Magic of Recluce'' (from which the series derives its name), was published in 1991. The series is still in publication with the latest, ''Outcasts of Order'', published in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modesitt|first1=L.E.|title=Bibliography|url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/the-books/saga-recluce/outcasts-of-order/|website=lemodesittjr.com|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Modesitt stated that the then 20 novels in the ''Recluce'' series had sold nearly three million copies.&lt;ref name="3mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/2015/04/21/perspective-on-the-hugos/ |title=Perspective on the Hugos |last=Modesitt, Jr. |first=L. E. |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-21 |publisher=lemodesittjr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20 books of the series describe the changing, often confrontational, relationship between the descendants of two technologically advanced cultures, representatives of whom have been marooned on a sparsely inhabited world and regressed to the level of the existing inhabitants' primitive technology. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ageism, racism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of its protagonists.

The series is published outside of internal chronological order. The first book published in the series occurs near the end of the overall story, with subsequent books jumping further into the past to expand on elements of history. The author recommends reading the books in publication order. As of the eighteenth novel, ''Heritage of Cyador'', the saga covers eight different time periods and eleven major story lines. The stories demonstrate the progression of real-life events into myth and legend over the progression of centuries, as the characters in one book will be known as heroes or mythical figures in other, chronologically later books. Additionally, certain characters appear in multiple books, the protagonists in one novel, appearing as a supporting characters in others.

Within the Recluce universe, all matter has inherent properties called "order" and "chaos".  Magic manifests as a person's ability to manipulate these properties through thought.  The feats which are feasible depend on the user's (genetically limited) potential, on developing those abilities, and on the laws that govern the interaction and balance between the two forces in nature.  Generally, those who manipulate order are called (black) mages.  Those who manipulate chaos are called (white) wizards.  Rare individuals (grays) can manipulate both.  There are personal costs to using magic, both immediate and long term.

*''Recluce Tales'' (January 3, 2017)

==Plot==
===Setting===
All of the novels take place in the same [[fantasy]] universe, spanning a time period of almost two thousand years.

Within this universe, all matter is made up of two competing forces: order and chaos.  In their natural state, these forces are equally matched, in a condition called Balance.  These two forces can be seen as fantasy representations of the natural entropy (chaos) that occurs in matter, balanced by the various molecular forces (order) that bind matter into structured forms.  These forces are understood, at a basic level, by all inhabitants of the world.  The colour white is identified with chaos; black with order.  The first published novel explains it this way: white is the chaotic combination of all wavelengths of visible light, while black is the absence of this light.

Rare individuals within the universe possess the inborn ability to manipulate these forces.  White wizards can draw chaos from a surrounding area and focus it into bolts of flame.  Black mages can concentrate order into matter, making it unnaturally strong.  Both forces can be used to kill or to shield.  Both types of wielders can, to a degree, discern the presence of both forces.  People who are being deceptive emanate chaos.

Gray mages are extremely rare.  They manipulate both order and chaos.  They are among the most powerful characters in the series.  They can prolong their lives and perform awesome magical feats.  "Grays" can choose the lifestyle of a Druid.  Druids live in seclusion and are far less known.  They exercise magic differently.

Part of the plot in each novel involves protagonists discovering novel ways to wield chaos and order.  Individuals vary significantly in innate magical strength and in skill at wielding it.  They improve through practice, personal experimentation, and by studying written lore (which is scant and cryptic).

The manipulation of chaos comes at a price: over time, it imbues a wizard, accelerating the deterioration of everything around him or her (example: wine turning to vinegar almost before the wizard can drink it).  Those wizards who channel chaos through their bodies (nearly all of them) have short lifespans, inversely proportional to the amount of chaos they raise.  Some have found ways to reduce this effect.  Additionally, any living being that is exposed to much chaos (such as the inhabitants of Fairhaven) experiences a burning sensation upon touching an ordered object, akin to touching an extremely cold object.  The effect's severity is proportional to the accumulated chaos.  For White Wizards, the result is often death.

The manipulation of order has costs too.  Wielding it carelessly can drain a mage of the order needed to sustain life (example: absent-mindedly stroking one's wooden staff).  Exceptional mages in the series discover ways to use order to funnel chaos, working around their inabilitity to manipulate chaos directly.  This is effective in combat but large actions backlash on the wielder because death itself releases chaos.  The unleashed chaos harms the mage.  It can cause disorientation, even sensory deprivation, for timespans proportional to the amount of destruction.

Most wielders of magic were marooned onto the world of Recluce from another universe. The new arrivals were not magical before arriving.  The influx of magic from the other universe occurred twice.  The ancestors of the people who wield white chaos were stranded first.  The ancestors of those who wield black order were marooned 600 years later.  Offspring can usually inherit magical abilities.

The native people have medieval technology.  Both groups of newcomers were space-farers but, in time, descend to the level of the locals.

Most of the novels take place long after these arrivals.  The reader discovers these matters through quotes and legends peppered throughout the series.  ''[[Fall of Angels]]'' provides a brief glimpse into that other universe.  Wizards descend from Rationalists ("Rats", "Demons").  Mages descend from Angels.  The Rationalists and Angels were separate cultures of a space-faring people in another universe.  The cultures were engaged in a war that spanned generations.  The technology, weaponry, and ideology of each culture is reflected in the magical abilities, hair colour, and world views of their descendants in the Recluce universe.

The arrival of the Angels is described in ''[[Fall of Angels]]'': a space warship, the ''Winterlance'', is part of an Angel fleet attacking a Rationalist blockade.  The Angels are losing.  During the battle, an exceptional event occurs: energy weapons of opposite types align and focus on the Winterlance.  The result is surprising: instead of being destroyed, the ship materializes elsewhere.  From various evidence, the crew concludes that they are in an alternate universe, ruled by different physical laws.  The ship no longer functions but it is close to a habitable planet, and the crew crash lands there.  Soon, individuals discover strange talents and physical changes (such as hair colour) that will ultimately become linked to order magic.  Upon contacting the planet's locals, they discover that Rationalists are also present on the planet.

===Chronology===
Chronologically, the series spans 1,855&amp;nbsp;years.{{efn|[http://www.travelinlibrarian.info/recluce/recluce/chronology.html Chronology] on the author's "Official Fan Site"}} The story actually begins well before even the earliest novel, with the arrival of the "demons of light" from another universe. Using their manifest chaos powers as well as their advanced technology, these people create an empire called Cyador, on the continent of Candar. While the series is named after Recluce, that island is uninhabited for the first millennium of the story.

The first two books, chronologically, are ''Magi'i of Cyador'' and ''Scion of Cyador'', which describe the operation of the Cyador army and its battles against the natives of Candar. These novels primarily serve to flesh out a formerly unknown part of the history of the universe. The story does establish one key element in the history of Cyador: the ultimate decline of the advanced technology of the Rationalists. Initially, upon landing on a mostly-uninhabited part of one of the world's continents, the Rationalists (later known as Demons) managed to create a number of advanced mechanical devices, powered by chaos. They also erected a number of collection towers that were used to focus chaos into these devices. By the time of the first novel, these towers are failing, and the empire is losing the ability to maintain its advanced technology. The opening of ''Magi'i of Cyador'' is usually considered "Year 1" in the history of Recluce.

''The Fall of Angels'', 400&amp;nbsp;years later, details the arrival of the Angels and the founding of the female-dominated city of Westwind. Unlike the Demons, the Angels manipulate order.  Of note are two specific angels, Nylan and Ryba, who would become legendary figures in coming novels. Ryba develops a talent for prophecy.  Her extensive writings are quoted by future generations as ''The Book of Ryba'', while Nylan develops the foundations of order magic. Nylan also fathers the child Weryl. In ''The Chaos Balance'', Nylan leaves Westwind for a more direct confrontation with Cyador. By this time, the fire-wagons and fire-lances that were once central to the empire have vanished, and the empire is fully dependent on its chaos wizards. The ultimate result of this confrontation is the founding of the Druids, which take up residence in a magically active forest called The Accursed Forest by the natives, but The Great Forest of Naclos in later generations.

Set ten years after the events in ''The Chaos Balance'', ''Arms-Commander'' follows the story of Saryn, the head of the guards of Westwind.  She tries to protect Westwind, as political and military problems build in the surrounding countries of Gallos, Lornth, and Suthya.  In this novel, characters indicate that almost 10 generations have passed since the reign of Lorn in Cyador.

Decades after the fall of Cyador, ''Cyador's Heirs'' finds its survivors have reestablished themselves in Cigoerne, a fertile country coveted by hostile neighbors in less hospitable lands. Young Lerial, the second son of Duke Kiedron, lives in the shadow of his older brother Lephi, the heir to their father's realm. Lerial's future seems preordained: He will one day command his brother's forces in defense of Cigoerne, serving at his older sibling's pleasure and no more. But when Lerial is sent abroad to be fostered by Major Altyrn to learn the skills and wisdom he will need to fulfill his future duties, he begins a journey into a much larger world that brings out his true potential. Lerial has talents that few, as yet, suspect: he is one of those rare beings who can harness both Order and Chaos, the competing natural forces that shape the world and define the magic that exists within it. And as war finally engulfs the fringes of Cigoerne, Lerial's growing mastery of Order and Chaos is tested to its limits
and his own.

Generations after the Angels reshaped the political climate in central Candar, the Prefect of Gallos seeks for an excuse to start another war with Westwind in the opening of ''The Mongrel Mage''. The Prefect sends three white mages with an escort to investigate 'raids' in the bordering plains between the two powers. Those mages are Beltur, his prominent white mage uncle, and his uncle's apprentice. After their findings displease the Prefect and his high mages, Beltur's uncle sacrifices himself so the young man can flee. With the aid of Jesslya, a young healer, Beltur travels to Elparta in Spidlar alongside a black mage named Athaal. Beltur, always considered weak as a white mage, is revealed to be a black, or possibly gray, mage. In Elparta he increases his skills in order magic, finds works serving in the city patrol and helping a coppersmith forge cupridium, and strives to recover from the turmoil of Gallos. Soon, however, he discovers he cannot escape his past, as the Prefect and his white mages decide to conquer Elparta with their powerful army. Recruited into Elparta's defense, Beltur excels as an arms-mage, bolstered by his desire to defend his new home and its people which now includes Jesslya, her mother, and many other recent friends. The victory of Elparta is marred by the loss of Athaal who Beltur was unable to save in battle. In ''Outcasts of Order'' Beltur attempts to return to his daily routine immediately after the war with Gallos but intrigue among the Trader's Council and the local group of black mages removes any chance he has to make Elparta his permanent home. He begins to train the young daughter of a black mage who is destined to be a powerful chaos wielder. Forced to flee after defending himself and his coppersmith partner from two murderous black mages, Beltur travels to Axalt as the request of the smith and with Jesslya as his new consort. Adjusting to a new life in Axalt grows increasingly complicated as once again the powerful are threatened by his presence. When his white mage apprentice and her family are exiled from Elparta they seek refuge with Beltur in Axalt. Despite assistance from the coppersmith's family Beltur, Jesslya and their guests are barely able to secure permission to stay. When he is unable to prevent a murder, Beltur tries to enact some justice for it, but ultimately is forced out of another city. Remembering an invitation from a mysterious trader in Montgren, Beltur and Jesslya travel with the young white mage and her family to the small duchy to seek a better life. Surviving bandit raids and surveying local power structures along the way, Beltur's followers arrive in Montgren to find themselves not only welcome, but expected. The Duchess offers them an enticing prospect - they can become the new council for a practically abandoned town, making it a home shaped in their own image. Beltur accepts and pledges to manage the town, Haven, as a place where mages of both chaos and order will be welcome. 

500&amp;nbsp;years after the arrival of the Angels, in ''The Towers of Sunset'', Cyador is long gone. But, half-way across the continent of Candar, towards the East, is Fairhaven: a city-state ruled by an oligarchy of white wizards.  Their prejudices and their written history imply that Fairhaven was founded by descendants of Cyador.  Westwind is the bulwark of the matriarchal societies of Western Candar which hold to the Legend of Ryba. Westwind is under threat from the white wizards of the city of Fairhaven, which exerts a great deal of influence over the male-dominated lands of Eastern Candar. A very strong order mage, Creslin, who is suggested to be the son of Weryl and grandson of the first "black mage" Nylan, flees female-dominated Westwind prior to an arranged marriage, only to be pursued by the white wizards who fear his strength. He ultimately escapes Candar, having married a chaos wizard in the process, and sails to the uninhabited island of Recluce. Here, Creslin begins a society based entirely on order magic. We also begin to learn the dangers of widespread order or chaos magic, as Creslin's unskilled efforts to make Recluce habitable cause severe weather elsewhere in the world, including massive storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts.

Several hundred years later, the chaos wizards in Candar have managed to conquer almost the entire continent. Beginning in the year 1190, ''The White Order'' and ''Colors of Chaos'' depict the progress of a young chaos wizard named Cerryl as he rises in the ranks of the white wizards. He is constantly fending off attempts on his life from the extremely powerful wizard Jeslek, who has begun to literally raise mountains from the ground to protect the paved highways the chaos wizards have been creating across Candar. At the same time, in the year 1200, ''The Magic Engineer'' details the journey of Dorrin, an order mage from Recluce. This is the point, both chronologically and to the reader, where the importance of balance between chaos and order starts to become apparent. (There are some hints in this regard in the first novel, but here the underlying causes are explained more fully.) Creslin's attempts to focus order around Recluce have led to an abundance of "free chaos" elsewhere in the world. This has led to increasingly stronger chaos wizards, ultimately leading to the formation of a 'chaos-focus' in the wizard Jeslek, granting him extraordinary strength. This, in turn, is allowing more order to be focused in Recluce, until something catastrophic happens to reset the balance.

Dorrin begins using order magic with his innate engineering talent to create steam-powered machines from order-infused wood and metal.  These are capable of containing large amounts of chaos energy. Of particular note are the extremely fast and powerful warships that Recluce begins to build, after Dorrin demonstrates their usefulness. The vast amount of order concentrated in these ships will accelerate the growth of chaos in the world. Dorrin spends some time in Candar fighting off the white wizards, then returns to Recluce to become the first "order engineer" and founds what later becomes the major city on Recluce, named after Nylan from "The Fall of Angels". Meanwhile, Jeslek is ultimately destroyed in his confrontation with Dorrin, leading to Cerryl becoming High Wizard and attempting some measure of truce with Recluce.

In 1500, the story continues with ''Natural Ordermage'' and ''Mage-Guard of Hamor''. It deals with the familiar motif of exile for a budding mage as yet unable and/or unwilling to control his newfound powers, this time on the continent-country of Hamor. The switch (which is a Modesitt trademark) from a pro-Recluce viewpoint to one inside the heretofore vilified Hamorian empire provides a probing look at prejudice, and also lays bare the conflict and corruption within the Recluce society and organizations at that time. Rahl, an apprentice scrivener with no taste for responsibility or accountability, is discovered by the magisters of Recluce to have an inordinately strong grasp of certain order abilities. As their methods are not suited to instruct one such as him he is exiled to Hamor. Caught in the middle of a conspiracy immediately after his arrival, Rahl soon finds himself in the infamous penal ironworks of Luba only to escape them when his abilities surface. As a mage-guard of the Empire he finds himself forced to become more than he was in order to survive first as a patroller and then as an officer in an army during a civil war.

After centuries of relative peace, in 1650, ''The Order War'' depicts the progress of two order mages from Recluce, Justen and Gunnar, as they attempt to defend the last free country in Candar from the white wizards, who have begun to use order-based soldiers to add to their own defense while simultaneously increasing their own chaos powers by increasing the amount of order in the world, as according to the plans of Cerryl from ''The White Order'' and ''Colors of Chaos''.  During their journey, Justen transitions himself into a gray mage, and is ultimately driven into the forest of Naclos, where he becomes a Druid. We also meet several legendary figures, including Ayrlyn (the wife of Nylan and one of the original angels) and the still alive Weryl, and learn how the Druids' mastery of both order and chaos has enabled them to keep their bodies alive for thousands of years. Justen leaves the forest and returns to fight the chaos wizards, and uses his newfound knowledge of order and chaos balance mastery to
form a tremendous weapon. This weapon unleashes the apocalyptic event that has been building for centuries, drawing on vast amounts of both order and chaos to utterly destroy the chaos wizards' capital city and kill nearly all of the powerful chaos wizards in the process. The result of this is a dramatic reduction in both free order and free chaos in the world.

Another diversionary storyline begins in 1710, with ''Wellspring of Chaos'' and ''Ordermaster'' depicting the life of an unlikely mage named Kharl. This storyline (which spans the continents of Nordla and Austra) tells the story of Kharl's transition from cooper to order-mage. Kharl becomes a powerful self-taught order-mage, an unlikely hero, and reputedly the most powerful black mage outside of Recluce during this time period. The two books flesh out the resistance of Nordla and Austra to the Empire of Hamor's attempts to expand their influence on the two continents. Notable characters from previous books of the series make brief appearances, including the gray wizard Justen. The two books flesh out two of the areas of the world that were mostly ignored in earlier novels and provides insight into the evolution of the Empire of Hamor, which plays a prominent part at the end of the series.

The final part of the saga occurs in the year 1850 and begins with ''The Magic of Recluce''. Gunnar, who has kept himself and his family alive using druidic techniques taught by his brother Justen, sends his son Lerris (who is unaware of his father's history and his own magical potential) to Candar to undertake a rite of passage commonly administered to dissatisfied individuals living in Recluce, especially those who have an affinity or ability for either order or chaos. While exiled to Candar, Lerris meets his uncle Justen, and comes to understand his father's ulterior motives for sending him off. Centuries of dominance by Recluce and their order engineers has once again led to increasingly more powerful chaos wizards in Candar, with one in particular threatening to cause trouble on the scale of the white council. Gunnar has sent Lerris to Candar with the suspicion that a strong order mage and strong chaos wizard will ultimately be drawn into direct conflict, and that Lerris would take care of the
problem without Recluce being directly involved. Lerris ultimately defeats the white wizard and settles down in Candar to live as a woodworker.

The climax of the story, 5 years later, in ''The Death of Chaos'' sees the powerful Empire of Hamor, the oldest inhabited continent in the world, has been using the relative instability of the rest of the world to consolidate its power. In the final climactic battle on the shores of Recluce, Lerris and his family use their mastery of order and chaos to forcibly impose a balance on the world, unleasing vast amounts of subterranean lava directly into the ocean beneath the invading Hamorian forces. In the end, Lerris uses the vast amounts of order in Recluce to bind all of the free chaos into small, balanced units (again, strongly reminiscent of particle physics). The result is the destruction of nearly all of the order and chaos magic in the world, including Lerris's family (which was being kept alive by magic) and even parts of the continent of Recluce itself.

==Reception==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
''The Magic of Recluce'' used a first-person viewpoint. The story is told from the perspective of the lead character, Lerris, but will switch to third person for any scenes in which Lerris is not involved. Many critics found this style of writing difficult to follow.

Some critics have become unhappy with perceived repetition; one fan sarcastically described the series as "[[Horatio Alger]] meets [[sword and sorcery]]." In particular, the stories of Lerris, Creslin, Dorrin, Cerryl, Lorn, and Rahl all seem to follow the same basic mold, of a young mage forced to "find himself" while learning to harness his power in ways other people discourage. Modesitt disputes this, claiming that (including his multiple non-Recluce novels) that "more than 60% of my books feature characters... older than 30 and more than 40% feature characters older than 40". He credits the criticism to a belief that "people confuse characters who learn something with young people discovering themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemodesittjr.com/blogs/monthly_question/2009/09/september-questions.html|title=Your Questions for the Author Answered - September Questions|last=Modesitt, Jr.|first=L. E.|date=September 2009|publisher=lemodesittjr.com|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the elements of this series reappear in Modesitt's other  series, [[Spellsong Cycle|The Spellsong Cycle]], including the appearance of outsiders from other worlds with profound magical ability, as well as the reuse of the "ultimate weapon" used by both Justen and Secca in their respective climactic battles.

He was born in Meggetland House, west of [[Edinburgh]] the eldest son of Thomas Sivright (1739-1813).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141306057/thomas-sivright&lt;/ref&gt; The large mansionhouse stood south of the junction of Colinton Road and Polwarth Terrace. The huge grounds are now the Meggetland sports fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/meggetland&lt;/ref&gt; The house was lost to a railway line in the 19th century.

In 1817 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were Sir [[David Brewster]], [[John Jamieson]], and [[James Bonar (scholar)|James Bonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected at the same time as [[James Skene]] and [[William Pulteney Alison]].&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Magazine vol 79, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volker Helmut Manfred Zotz''' (born October 28, 1956) is an eminent [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], [[religious studies]] scholar, [[Buddhologist]] and a prolific author.&lt;ref&gt;"Volker Zotz," in ''[[Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender]]'',  Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter 2011, 23rd edition ({{ISBN|978-3-598-23630-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
The Zotz family originated in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and spread to [[Germany]]. Volker Zotz was born in [[Landau in der Pfalz]], [[Germany]], where he attended elementary school and high school.

His interest in [[spirituality]] led him to an early study of [[Christianity]] as well as of [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Chinese religions]]. What impressed him most was Buddhist philosophy and meditation. When Zotz was sixteen he became a major disciple of [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], with whom he was close until his death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arya-maitreya-mandala.org/#amsterdam Major disciples of Lama Anagarika Govinda]&lt;/ref&gt; During his high school days, Zotz also met the author [[Oscar Kiss Maerth]], whose ideas he did not completely agree with, but with whom he had an intense exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Kossy]]: ''Strange creations: aberrant ideas of human origins.'' Feral House 2001, {{ISBN|9780922915651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Max Slevogt]] High School in Landau in the 1970s, he published his first poems in two volumes&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation.'' Scheden: Verlagsedition Dittmer 1978 ({{ISBN|3-88297-031-6}}) und ''Geraunt.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-039-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and a novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Projekt Adytum.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-041-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[conscientious objector]] Zotz had to perform eighteen months of [[alternative civilian service]] in a nursing home. From 1978 he studied Buddhism under Ernst Steinkellner and [[philosophy]] under [[Kurt Rudolf Fischer]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. He repeatedly interrupted his studies in Vienna to conduct research and fieldwork in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Afghanistan]] and to receive spiritual training from Lama Anagarika Govinda.

== Career ==
In 1986 Zotz received a Ph. D. from the University of Vienna for his [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] ''Zur Rezeption, Interpretation und Kritik des Buddhismus im deutschen Sprachraum.'' This dissertation investigates the influence of Buddhism on German philosophy, literature and culture during the [[Fin de siècle]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Bibliography of Austrian Philosophy 1986/87''. Amsterdam 1996, p.171 ({{ISBN|90-420-0036-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Zotz has been a [[lecturer]] of Buddhist philosophy at the University of Vienna. 1989 he moved to [[Japan]] where he was a [[professor]] and researcher at [[Ryukoku University]] and [[Otani University]] in [[Kyoto]] and at [[Rissho University]] in [[Tokyo]] for ten years. During the period in Japan he was influenced considerably by the Buddhologist [[Takamaro Shigaraki]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction by Volker Zotz to Takamaro Shigaraki: ''Sogar der Gute wird erlöst, um wie viel mehr der Böse. Der Weg des buddhistischen Meisters Shinran.'' Luxembourg 2004 ({{ISBN|2-9599829-2-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Zotz was appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Luxembourg]]. At that time he was also teaching at [[Saarland University]].

Besides his scholarly work, Volker Zotz’s European audience knows him as author and publicist. The volume, ''Buddha'', is the most popular book on its topic in German language, regularly reprinted and translated into several languages. Zotz is a leading member of the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], founded by Lama Anagarika Govinda in 1933. In the early 1990s Zotz initiated a study centre called ''Komyoji'' in Austria which is an attempt at describing a cross-cultural philosophy of religion. Since 1994 Zotz has been the driving force behind many of Komyoji’s educational programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komyoji.at Komyoji Website]&lt;/ref&gt; such as workshops explaining various philosophical and theological topics. Volker Zotz is married to the Austrian writer and anthropologist [[Birgit Zotz]].

'''''What is a Masterpiece?''''' is a 1979 non-fiction book by British [[historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]]. It is a transcribed version of the [[Walter Neurath]] memorial lectures given by Clark. The work, initially released on 1 January 1979, received a [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] republication on 1 May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Masterpiece?|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2432730.What_Is_a_Masterpiece_|publisher=[http://www.goodreads.com/ goodreads.com]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Kenneth Clark]] had already achieved fame with a series of popular books while also serving as, from 1969 on, the writer, producer and presenter of the [[BBC]] programme, ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'', a pioneering television [[Television documentary|documentary series]]. The prestigious series earned a [[Peabody Award]] as well as general commercial success. In the work, he articulated his viewpoint that cultural, political, and scientific progress can be shown from society to society in the [[Western world]] as time passes through pieces of [[visual art]].

==Contents==
Clark's work on masterpieces emphatically supports the concept that there is such a thing as a masterpiece and that in some sense it may be objectively defined or comprehended. He opposes this to a certain form of [[cultural relativism]] that had become prominent in recent decades and may in part be attributed to the influence of [[postmodernism]]. In particular, the notion of a masterpiece was related to the balance between the particular (the fruits of the era in which the artist lived) with the universal (the grand themes raised by the human condition itself) in Clark's view.

Clark's definition of an artistic masterpiece was based on a number of different considerations and criteria that apply to different works produced in markedly different time periods and milieux. For example, in this particular work he argued that it is the "creation of an individual artist's authentic genius." At the same time, he expounded a number of other aspects that for him were essential in the configuration of a masterpiece: that it is "a confluence of memories and emotions forming a single idea", that it has "a power of recreating traditional forms so that they become expressive of an artist's own epoch and yet keep a relationship to the past". The highest masterpieces are said to be "illustrations of great themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamal|first1=Peter A.|title=Cultural Contingencies: Behavior Analytic Perspectives on Cultural Practices|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275957764|page=274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-VHz9PUGsC&amp;pg=PA274 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark also implicitly excluded the erotic from considerations of what constituted a masterpiece, based on his perspective that a necessary condition is the balance between sense and form (works that are too sensual are, therefore, unbalanced and not to be categorised at masterpiece level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trosman|first1=Harry|title=Contemporary Psychoanalysis and Masterworks of Art and Film|date=2000|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0814782655|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gj5RS7Oj1UC&amp;pg=PA65 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Wildenstein Index Number''' refers to an item in a numerical system published in catalogues by [[Daniel Wildenstein]], a scholar of [[Impressionism]], who published [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] of artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] through his family business, Wildenstein &amp; Company. In these catalogues, each painting by an [[artist]] was assigned a unique number. These index numbers are now used throughout the art world, in art texts, and on art websites to uniquely identify specific [[work of art|works of art]] by specific artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmonet.com/Home_Page.htm|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=artofmonet.com|title=Series and Themes (Home Page)  - Grain Stacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TUM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lemonedes, Heather, Lynn Federle Orr and David Steel, ''Monet in Normandy,'' Rizzoli International Publications, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8478-2842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example is the ''{{Lang|fr|Monet: Catalogue Raisonné}}'' ({{ISBN|978-3-8228-8559-8}}), which is a four volume set published in 1996 with 2,580 illustrations in 1,540 pages. In this set, volume I is a [[biography]] and volumes II-IV contain a chronological listing of Monet's work; that is to say, volume II contains Wildenstein Index #1 produced in 1858 through #968 produced in 1885. The catalogue is produced with text in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], and [[German language|German]]. The original version of this set was a five-volume black-and-white edition that has become [[collectible]] at costs of approximately U.S.$10,000 because it was originally only available to large [[museum]]s or major [[universities]]' art departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/3822885592|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Monet: Catalogue Raisonné [BOX SET] (Hardcover)|author=Wildenstein, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original black-and-white version was published in 1974 in four volumes and had a 1991 supplementary volume of additional paintings as well as drawings and pastels.  The 1996 revised edition in multiple languages does not include pastels, drawings, letters or footnotes from the original edition. Thus, the original is the most valuable resource for scholars.&lt;ref name=TUM&gt;Ganz, James A. and Richard Kendall, ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings,'' 2007, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, {{ISBN|978-0-300-11862-9}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, this gives the foundation an effective monopoly over deciding whether a work of art is a genuine Monet, or not. This has been called into question, as the Wildensteins are free to disregard the opinions of art experts and art historians worldwide if they so choose (as discussed in the BBC programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast by the [[BBC]] on June 19, 2011 referring to the painting ''{{Lang|fr|[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]}}'').  See: {{Cite episode| title = Monet| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125bz7| accessdate = August 4, 2011| series = Fake or Fortune? | network = [[BBC]] | airdate = June 19, 2011| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the catalogues are published with Daniel as the author, other members of the five-generation family business were also responsible for promulgating this numbering system.  Daniel's father Georges Wildenstein published catalogues raisonnés for [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0571093140|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Chardin: catalogue raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J2VI3W|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=The Paintings of Fragonard: Complete Edition with a Catalogue Raisonné and 350 Illustrations|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son, Alec, has published a catalogue for [[Odilon Redon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/2850472468|title=Odilon Redon: Catalogue Raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Alec|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
