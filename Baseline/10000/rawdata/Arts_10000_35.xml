'''''4′33″''''' (pronounced "'''Four minutes, thirty-three seconds'''" or just "'''Four thirty-three'''")&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002"&gt;Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-[[movement (music)|movement]] composition&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Pritchett, Kuhn, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–71,&amp;nbsp;86,&amp;nbsp;105,&amp;nbsp;198,&amp;nbsp;218,&amp;nbsp;231.&lt;/ref&gt; by American [[Experimental music|experimental]] composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece consists of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed,&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is commonly perceived as "four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard 2003, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, ''4′33″'' being the total length of the first public performance.&lt;ref&gt;Published score, Edition Peters 6777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived around 1947–48, while the composer was working on ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'',&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; ''4′33″'' became for Cage the epitome of his idea that any sounds may constitute [[Definition of music|music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.classicalnotes.net/columns/silence.html| title = John Cage and the Avant-Garde: The Sounds of Silence| accessdate = April 4, 2007| last = Gutmann| first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Gutmann (journalist)| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a reflection of the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]], which Cage studied since the late 1940s. In a 1982 interview, and on numerous other occasions, Cage stated that ''4′33″'' was, in his opinion, his most important work.&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz 2003, 70"&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' describes ''4′33″'' as Cage's "most famous and controversial creation".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

==History of composition==

===Background and influences===
Silence played a major role in several of Cage's works composed before ''4′33″''. The ''Duet for Two Flutes'' (1934), composed when Cage was 22, opens with silence, and silence was an important structural element in some of the ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'' (1946–48), ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951) and ''Two Pastorales'' (1951). The ''Concerto for prepared piano and orchestra'' (1951) closes with an extended silence, and ''Waiting'' (1952), a piano piece composed just a few months before ''4′33″'', consists of long silences framing a single, short [[ostinato]] pattern. Furthermore, in his songs ''[[The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs]]'' (1942) and ''[[A Flower]]'' (1950) Cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument, which may be understood as a metaphor of silence.&lt;ref&gt;Revill 1993, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time Cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 (or 1948) lecture at [[Vassar College]], ''A Composer's Confessions''. Cage told the audience that he had "several new desires", one of which was
&lt;blockquote&gt;to compose a piece of uninterrupted silence and sell it to [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak Co]]. It will be three or four-and-a-half minutes long—those being the standard lengths of "canned" music and its title will be ''Silent Prayer''.

The ending will approach imperceptibility.&lt;ref name="pritchett"&gt;Pritchett 1993, 59, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the time, however, Cage felt that such a piece would be "incomprehensible in the Western context," and was reluctant to write it down: "I didn't wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke. I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it."&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164"&gt;Revill 1993, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Alfred Leslie]] recalls Cage presenting a "one-minute-of-silence talk" in front of a window during the late 1940s, while visiting Studio 35 at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Stein, Judith |year=2009 |title=Interview: Alfred Leslie |magazine=[[Art in America]] |issue=January 2009 |page=92 |url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |access-date=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204172036/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |archive-date=December 4, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Cage visited the [[anechoic chamber]] at [[Harvard University]]. An anechoic chamber is a room designed in such a way that the walls, ceiling and floor absorb all sounds made in the room, rather than reflecting them as echoes. Such a chamber is also externally sound-proofed. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he wrote later, "I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my [[nervous system]] in operation, the low one my blood in [[circulatory system|circulation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |title=A few notes about silence and John Cage |date=November 24, 2004 |publisher=CBC.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212191730/http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. "Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music."&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of ''4′33″''.

Another cited influence&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164" /&gt; for this piece came from the field of the visual arts. Cage's friend and sometimes colleague [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings, seemingly "blank" canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, "Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings [...] when I saw those, I said, 'Oh yes, I must. Otherwise I'm lagging, otherwise music is lagging'."&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to an article called On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works, John Cage writes "To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later."&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John. Silence: Lectures and Writings. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors===
Compositions that, like ''4′33″'', include no sounds produced by the performer, were conceived by a number of composers and writers before Cage. Examples include the following:
* [[Alphonse Allais]]'s 1897 ''Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man'', consisting of twenty-four blank measures.&lt;ref&gt;Allais, Alphonse. 1897. ''[[Album primo-avrilesque]]'', p. 23-26. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86263801/f29.image Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Allais was an associate of [[Erik Satie]], and given Cage's profound admiration for Satie, it is possible that Cage was inspired by the ''Funeral March''. When asked, Cage claimed he was unaware of Allais's composition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1991, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1903 novel ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet'', silent concerts are given by the Talpa people.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Gaston. 1903. ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet''. [http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/pdf/leroux_double_vie_t_longuet.pdf Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 "In futurum", a movement from the ''Fünf Pittoresken'' for piano. The Czech composer's meticulously notated composition is made up entirely of rests.&lt;ref&gt;Bek, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Harold Acton]]'s 1928 book ''Cornelian'' a musician conducts "performances consisting largely of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Humphrey. 1990. ''The Brideshead Generation: Evelyn Waugh and His Friends'', 153. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-44142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1947, jazz musician [[Dave Tough]] joked that he was writing a play in which "A string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written. It's made up entirely of rests. [...] Suddenly, the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin. 'Lout,' he screams, 'you played that last measure wrong.'"&lt;ref&gt;"New Jazz: 'All or Nothing at All'" (March 16, 1947) ''The Washington Post''. p. S7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yves Klein]]'s 1949 ''Monotone-Silence Symphony'' (informally ''The Monotone Symphony'', conceived 1947–48), an orchestral forty-minute piece whose second and last movement is a twenty-minute silence&lt;ref&gt;See sources and recordings at the [[Yves Klein]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the first movement being an unvarying twenty minute drone).
{{further|List of silent musical compositions}}
The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has argued that ''4′33″'' is an example of [[Automatic behavior|automatism]].  Since the [[Romantic Era]] composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections, transcending the boundaries of time and space. In automatism, composers wish to completely remove both the composers and the artist from the process of creation. This is motivated by the belief that what we think of as "self-expression" is really just an infusion of the art with the social standards that we have been subjected to since birth. Therefore, the only way to achieve truth is to remove the artist from the process of creation. Cage achieves that by employing chance (e.g., use of the ''[[I Ching]]'', or tossing coins) to make compositional decisions. In ''4′33″'', neither artist nor composer has any impact on the piece, so that Cage has no way of controlling what ambient sounds will be heard by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | They missed the point. There's no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn't know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.

| style="text-align: right;" | — [[John Cage]] speaking about the premiere of ''4′33″''&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz 2003, 70" /&gt;
|}
The premiere of the three-movement ''4′33″'' was given by [[David Tudor]] on August 29, 1952, in [[Maverick Concert Hall]], [[Woodstock, New York]], as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. The audience saw him sit at the piano and, to mark the beginning of the piece, close the keyboard lid. Some time later he opened it briefly, to mark the end of the first movement. This process was repeated for the second and third movements.&lt;ref&gt;The actions of Tudor in the first performance are often misdescribed so that the lid is explained as being open during the movements. Cage's handwritten score (produced after the first performance) states that the lid was closed during the movements, and opened to mark the spaces between.&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece remains controversial to this day, and is seen as challenging the very [[definition of music]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In defining [[noise music]] and its value, Paul Hegarty in ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) contends that Cage's ''4′33″'' represents the beginning of [[noise music]] proper. For Hegarty, noise music, as with ''4′33″'', is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between "desirable" sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable "noise" that make up all noise music.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hegarty, ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

''4′33″'' challenges, or rather exploits to a radical extent, the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette, experimenting on unsuspecting concert-goers to prove an important point. First, the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audience's expectations for the piece. As a result, the listener is more focused, giving Cage's ''4′33″'' the same amount of attention (or perhaps even more) as if it were Beethoven's Ninth.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71"&gt;Taruskin 2009, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even before the performance, the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert. Furthermore, the audience's behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall; they will quietly sit and listen to 4′33” of ambient noise. It is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes, unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette.

The second point made by ''4′33″'' concerns duration. According to Cage, duration is the essential building block of all of music. This distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound. As a result, the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of "time buckets".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; They could be filled with either sounds, silence or noise; where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness. In the spirit of his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], Cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or perhaps even integral part of his music composition. ''4′33″'' serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept, asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition, then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds?

The third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71" /&gt; In the case of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring|Rite of Spring]]'', this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots. In Cage's ''4′33″'', the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer. Nevertheless, in ''4′33″'' the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece. Since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise, the audience's behavior, their whispers and movements, are essential elements that fill the above-mentioned time buckets.

In a 2013 [[TED Talk]], philosophy professor Julian Dodd argues that ''4′33″'' is witty [[conceptual art]], but does not meet the criteria for it to count as music, instead challenging the listener to question what the nature of music is.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=WTCVnKROlos&amp;t=13m38s|title=Is John Cage's 4′33″ music? Prof. Julian Dodd at TEDxUniversityOfManchester}}, June 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 TED Talk, psychologist Paul Bloom puts forward ''4′33″'' as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences our opinion about it as "that silence is different from other forms of silence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure?language=en#|title=Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure - Talk Video - TED.com|author =Paul Bloom|work=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions of the score===
Several versions of the score exist:&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph summarizes some of the findings from Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four known later versions, one of which is in the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;Carol Vogel (November 15, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/arts/design/a-glenn-ligon-at-national-gallery-john-cage-at-moma.html A Moment of Silence at MoMA] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The original Woodstock manuscript (August 1952): conventional notation, dedicated to [[David Tudor]]. This manuscript is currently lost. Tudor's attempt at re-creating the original score is reproduced in Fetterman 1996, 74.
* The Kremen manuscript (1953): graphic, space-time notation, dedicated to [[Irwin Kremen]]. The movements of the piece are rendered as space between long vertical lines; a tempo indication is provided (60), and at the end of each movement the time is indicated in minutes and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Edition Peters No. 6777a. Kremen was given the score by Cage on June 5, 1953, for his 28th birthday. The score was later purchased for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] by [[Henry R. Kravis]] in honor of his wife, [[Marie-Josée Drouin]], the museum's president.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;
* The so-called ''First Tacet Edition'': a typewritten score, lists the three movements using Roman numbers, with the word "[[Tacet|TACET]]" underneath each. A note by Cage describes the first performance and mentions that "the work may be performed by any instrumentalist or combination of instrumentalists and last any length of time." Edition Peters No. 6777 (out of print).
* The so-called ''Second Tacet Edition'': same as the First, except that it is printed in Cage's calligraphy, and the explanatory note mentions the Kremen manuscript. Edition Peters No. 6777 (i.e., it carries the same catalog number as the first ''Tacet Edition'') Additionally, a facsimile, reduced in size, of the Kremen manuscript, appeared in July 1967 in ''Source'' 1, no. 2:46–54; the ''First Tacet Edition'' is described in Nyman 1974, 3, but it is not reproduced in that book.

There is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements of the premiere performance, specified in different versions of the score. The Woodstock printed program specifies the lengths 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″, as does the Kremen manuscript, and presumably the original manuscript had the same indications. However, in the ''First Tacet Edition'' Cage writes that at the premiere the timings were 33″, 2′40″ and 1′20″. In the ''Second Tacet Edition'' he adds that after the premier a copy has been made for Irwin Kremen, in which the lengths of the movements were 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″. The causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood, the original manuscript being still lost.&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002" /&gt;

===''4′33″ No. 2''===
In 1962, Cage wrote '''''0′00″''''', which is also referred to as '''''4′33″ No. 2'''''. The directions originally consisted of one sentence: "In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action." At the first performance Cage had to write that sentence.

The second performance added four new qualifications to the directions: "the performer should allow any interruptions of the action, the action should fulfill an obligation to others, the same action should not be used in more than one performance, and should not be the performance of a musical composition."&lt;ref name="pritchett" /&gt;

===''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''===
In late 1989, three years before his death, Cage revisited the idea of ''4′33″'' one last time. He composed ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', the full title of which is ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4′33″ (0′00″) + [[Image:GClef.svg|9px]]''. As in all [[Number Pieces|number pieces]], "One" refers to the number of performers required. The score instructs the performer to build a [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] in the concert hall, so that "the whole hall is on the edge of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], without actually feeding back." The content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://johncage.org/pp/John-Cage-Work-Detail.cfm?work_ID=299 |title= One3 = 4'33" (0'0") + [G clef] |website= John Cage |access-date= 25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and recordings==
''4′33″'' has been recorded on several occasions: [[Frank Zappa]] recorded it as part of ''A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute'', on the Koch label, 1993; in 2002, [[James Tenney]] performed ''4′33″'' at Rudolf Schindler's historic [[Kings Road House]] in celebration of the work's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney's recording is archived on line via The Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound (SASSAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several performances of ''4′33″'' including a "techno remix" by [[New Waver]] were broadcast on Australian radio station [[ABC Classic FM]], as part of a program exploring "sonic responses" to Cage's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|title=ABC Classic FM music details for 11 July 2001|access-date=January 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425183449/http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kouvaras|first=Linda|title=Loading the Silence: Australian Sound Art in the Post-Digital Age|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham|isbn=9781409441564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish electronic band [[Covenant (band)|Covenant]] concluded their 2000 album ''[[United States of Mind (album)|United States of Mind]]'' with a rendition of ''4′33″'' entitled "You Can Make Your Own Music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Alexander S.|date=2013|title=Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=43|isbn=9780199339624|quote=Industrial trio Covenant conclude their 2000 album ''United States of Mind'' with four minutes and thirty-three soundless seconds (on a track called "You Can Make Your Own Music"), nodding slyly to composer John Cage, whose silent ''4’33”'' of 1952 may be the ultimate open question of what constitutes music; but the other ten songs on Covenant's album are more or less all pop tunes with scarcely a trace of Cage's vital indeterminacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2004, at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London, the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] gave the UK's first orchestral performance of this work. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and one of the main challenges was that the station's emergency backup systems are designed to switch on and play music whenever apparent silence ([[dead air]]) lasting longer than a preset duration is detected. They had to be switched off for this performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/01_january/12/john_cage.shtml|title=BBC Press Office, Cage Uncaged|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tongue-in-cheek]] version was recorded by the staff of the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper on January 16, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/16/1?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Guardian recording of 4′33|date=January 16, 2004 | location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the work was voted to be number 40 in the ABC radio's [[Classic 100 piano (ABC)|Classic 100 piano countdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Classic 100 Piano |url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/classic100/piano.htm |publisher=[[ABC Classic FM]] |accessdate=25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silence of four minutes and thirty-three seconds appears as the penultimate track of the 2009 [[Living Colour]] album [[The Chair in the Doorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Colour –  The Chair In The Doorway|url=https://www.discogs.com/Living-Colour-The-Chair-In-The-Doorway/master/236886 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2010, an international simultaneous performance of Cage's ''4′33″'' took place involving over 200 performers, amateur and professional musicians, and artists. The global orchestra, conducted live by Bob Dickinson, former member of post-punk group [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], via video link, performed the piece in support of the Cage Against The Machine campaign to bring ''4′33″'' to Christmas number 1 in 2010. A second performance took place on December 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're pitching the silence of John Cage against the noise of Simon Cowell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|location=London|first=Norman|last=Lebrecht|authorlink=Norman Lebrecht| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110121140124/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html| archivedate= January 21, 2011  | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A is for Activist''''' is a bestselling [[children's literature | children's]] [[alphabet book | alphabet]] [[board book]] by [[Innosanto Nagara]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/style/activist-books-for-children.html|date=2017-06-30|accessdate=2017-07-05|first=Ruth|title=Children's Primers Court the Littlest Radicals|last=La Ferla|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/2830-a-is-for-activist |title=A is for Activist |publisher=Seven Stories Press |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut as both an author and an illustrator, he initially wrote it for his children out of a desire for a political yet educational book, and then, receiving positive responses from both friends and [[Kickstarter]] campaign, published it through [[Triangle Square]].

==Background==
Nagara, heavily involved in activism and social justice initiatives, originally wrote ''A is for Activist'' for his son, out of a perceived need for a "pro-activist, pro-social justice, pro-gay, pro-labor, pro-diversity, pro-gressive ABC book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisforactivist.com/about/about-the-authorillustrator/ |title=About the Author/Illustrator |first=Innosanto |last=Nagara |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recommendation of friends, he sought to publish a larger run of the book, finding that the costs of printing individual board books quickly became prohibitive. Eventually, Nagara started a campaign on Kickstarter that raised $4,501 in 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899417592/a-is-for-activist-working-title |title=A is for Activist! |publisher=Kickstarter.com |first=Innosanto |last=Nagara |date=2012-07-29 |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed him to self-publish and have 3,000 copies of the book printed&amp;mdash;he packaged them in his home and sent orders out through the post office, and despite being a one-man operation, sold all 3,000 copies in a matter of months.&lt;ref name=pubweek /&gt;

Nagara began sending his book to various independent presses, but found that most had "reservations" about the cost of printing and were unfamiliar with the format. Eventually, he found a publisher in Triangle Square, an imprint of Seven Stories Press, and the book has had more than four printings. Seven Stories' Spanish-language imprint, Siete Cuentos, also published an edition translated by the musician [[Martha Gonzalez (musician)|Martha Gonzalez]] in fall 2014.&lt;ref name=pubweek&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/62213-from-activist-to-author.html |publisher=Publisher's Weekly |first=Jennifer |last=McCartney |date=2014-05-12 |accessdate=2017-06-01 |title=From Activist to Author}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audiobook version, read by the guitarist and activist [[Tom Morello]], has been made free online.&lt;ref name=tom /&gt;

==Reception==
Over 125,000 copies of the book are in print, making it a children's bestseller according to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' also called identified it as one of many topical children's books oriented towards social issues that have become a trend recently.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Authors including Naomi Klein, Opal Palmer Adisa, and Winona LaDuke have all reacted positively and other reviewers, like [[Yes! (U.S. magazine) | Yes! Magazine]] found the book and its content charming, stating that the "alliteration and rhymes have the rhythm and fun of standard ABC books," while still imparting a political message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/in-review-a-is-for-activist-by-innosanto-nagara |publisher=Yes! Magazine |date=2012-11-14 |first=Corey |last=Hill |accessdate=2017-06-01 |title=A is for Activist by Innosanto Nagara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviewers who have agreed with the political messages of the book have questioned if they really belong in an alphabet book at all. Kyle Lukoff, writing for the [[American Library Association]], wondered "if a clumsily-rhymed collection of chants is an effective way to accomplish" introducing children to social justice and pointed out that families "may need to undergo hours of explanation and long, ongoing conversations about ideas raised on every single page." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtrt.ala.org/reviews/a-is-for-activist/ |publisher=American Library Association LGBT Roundtable |title=A is for Activist |date=2013-06-17 |first=Kyle |last=Lukoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's specific focus was to address the under-representation of women in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]]'s Painting and Sculpture Annual, the precursor to what is now known as the [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the months leading up to the exhibition in December of 1970, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists staged numerous protests and interventions at the museum circulating their demand that 50% of artists represented in the upcoming exhibition be women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whitney.org/Education/EducationBlog/BiennialAndWomenArtists|title=The Biennial and Women Artists: A Look Back At Feminist Protests At The Whitney {{!}} Whitney Museum of American Art|last=Meller|first=Sarah|date=|website=whitney.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/374428/three-lessons-from-artists-protests-of-the-whitney-museum-in-the-1960s-70s/|title=Three Lessons from Artists' Protests of the Whitney Museum in the 1960s-70s|last=Wallace|first=Caroline|date=April 27, 2017|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the opening of the 1970 Sculpture Annual, they printed fake tickets and distributed a forged press release stating that "half the artists in the exhibition would indeed be women, with a proportional percentage of black, Asian, and Puerto Rican artists," forcing the director of the museum to issue a statement to the contrary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The group's actions had quantifiable results--the number of women represented rose from 4.5 to 22 percent in one year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the winter of 1970-71 the group established the Women's Art Registry, a slide collection of work by female artists, which served as a model for later registries like [[West-East Bag]] (W.E.B.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The registry was housed by several galleries, including cooperatives 55 Mercer and [[A.I.R.

'''Annette  Lemieux''' (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists ([[David Salle]], [[Jack Goldstein]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Richard Prince]]). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological [[minimalism]].  Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.
Lemieux has been the recipient of awards from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Monserrat College]] of Art.  Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at [[Harvard University]] in the area of visual and environmental studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/07/annette-lemieux-html|title=Annette Lemieux|date=1 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in [[New York City|New York]].

==Early life==

Annette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Annette|title=The Strange Life of Objects|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, she received her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7002021784|title=Lemieux, Annette – Grove Art|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

In early works like ''[[It’s a Wonderful Life]]'', 1986 [named after the 1946 [[Frank Capra]] film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;  Following the legacies of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[John Cage]], she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”.  Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amalfitano|first1=Lelia|last2=Hoos Fox|first2=Judith|title=The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand.  As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Annette, Lelia Amalfitano, Judith H. Fox, Rosetta Brooks, Peggy Phelan, Robert Pincus-Witten, and Lucy Flint-Gohlke. The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux. Champaign, Ill: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/index.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions – Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective "The Strange Life of Objects," Elizabeth Michelman explains that, "[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=32&amp;a=2|title=Elizabeth Michelman. "The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux." artscope New England.|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her recent show entitled ''Unfinished Business'' at the [[Carpenter Center]], Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades.  Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.
With representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the [[Krannert Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/checklist.cfm.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions - Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvard University.

==Collections==
Lemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; [[The Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum of American Art]]; Solomon R.

The '''Apollo 11 missing tapes''' were those that were recorded from [[Apollo 11]]'s [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) telecast in its raw format on [[telemetry]] data tape at the time of the first [[moon landing]] in 1969 and subsequently lost. The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television broadcasts failed for any reason.

In order to broadcast the SSTV transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations performed real-time [[scan conversion]] to the [[NTSC]] television format. The moonwalk's converted video signal was broadcast live around the world on July 21, 1969 (2:56 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded on many [[videotape]]s and [[kinescope]] films. Many of these low-quality recordings remain intact. The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes as a backup in the event that real-time conversion and broadcast failed. As the real-time broadcast worked, was shown and widely recorded, preservation of the backup video was not deemed a priority in the years immediately following the mission.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely the tapes were erased and reused at this time.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

A team of retired NASA employees and contractors tried to find the tapes in the early 2000s but was unable to do so. The search was sparked when several still photographs appeared in the late 1990s that showed the superior-looking raw SSTV transmission on ground station monitors. The research team conducted a multi-year investigation in the hopes of finding the most pristine and detailed video images of the moonwalk. If copies of the original SSTV format tapes were to be found, more modern digital technology could make a higher-quality conversion, yielding better images than those originally seen. The researchers concluded that the tapes containing the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signal were [[Bulk eraser|erased]] and reused by NASA in the early 1980s, following standard procedure at the time.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}}{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} 

Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes as well as [[Super 8 mm film|super 8 movie film]] taken of a video monitor in Australia, showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved restoration project of the first moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced footage obtained during the search. [[Lowry Digital]] completed the full moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.

[[Apollo 11]] was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969, at 02:56 UTC; [[Buzz Aldrin]] joined him about 20 minutes later.

Only limited radio bandwidth was available to transmit the video signal from the lunar landings, which needed to be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with other communication and telemetry channels beamed from the [[Lunar Module]], back to Earth.{{sfnp|Coan|1973|pp=1–2}} Therefore, Apollo 11's moonwalk video was transmitted from the [[Apollo TV camera]] in a monochrome [[slow-scan television|SSTV]] format at 10 frames per second (fps) with 320 lines of resolution, [[progressive scan|progressively scanned]].{{sfnp|Lebar|Hoffman|1967|p=3}} These SSTV signals were received by [[radio telescopes]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[tracking station]], and [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] tracking station.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|p=2}} The camera's video format was incompatible with existing [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]] broadcast television standards. It needed to be converted before it could be shown on broadcast television networks. This live [[scan conversion|conversion]] was crude, essentially using a video camera pointing at a high-quality 10-inch TV monitor.

===Video signal processing===
Since the camera's scan rate was much lower than the approximately 30 fps for NTSC video,{{refn|group="Note"|For the purposes of clarity and simplicity in this article, 60 fields and 30 frames per second are used. NTSC actually runs at 59.94 fields per second, and 29.97 frames per second. Two interlaced fields create one complete video frame.}} the television standard used in North America at the time, a real-time [[scan conversion]] was needed to be able to show its images on a regular TV set. NASA selected a scan converter manufactured by [[RCA]] to convert the black-and-white SSTV signals from the Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 11 missions.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

When the Apollo TV camera radioed its images, the ground stations received its raw unconverted SSTV signal and split it into two branches. One signal branch was sent unprocessed to a fourteen-track analog [[data]] [[tape recorder]] where it was recorded onto fourteen-inch diameter reels of one-inch-wide [[analog signal|analog]] [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic data tapes]] at {{nowrap|120 inches}} per second.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}} The other raw SSTV signal branch was sent to the RCA scan converter where it would be processed into an NTSC broadcast television signal.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}}

The RCA scan converter operated on an optical conversion principle.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} The conversion process started when the signal was sent to a high-quality 10-inch video monitor where a conventional RCA TK-22 television camera—using the NTSC broadcast standard of 525 scanned lines [[interlaced video|interlaced]] at 30 fps—merely re-photographed its screen. The monitor had persistent phosphors, that acted as a primitive [[framebuffer]].{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} An analog disk recorder, based on the [[Ampex#HS-100 .26 HS-200 .22slo-mo.22 disc recorder|Ampex HS-100 model]], was used to record the first field from the camera.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} It then fed that field, and an appropriately time-delayed copy of the first field, to the NTSC Field Interlace Switch (encoder). The combined original and copied fields created the first full 525-line interlaced frame and the signal was then sent to Houston.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The disk recorder repeated this sequence five more times, until the camera imaged the next SSTV frame.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The converter then repeated the whole process with each new frame downloaded from space in real-time.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} In this way, the RCA converter produced the extra 20 frames per second needed to produce flicker-free images to the world's television broadcasters.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

This live conversion was crude compared to early-21st-century electronic digital conversion techniques. Image degradation was unavoidable with this system as the monitor and camera's optical limitations significantly lowered the original SSTV signal's [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[brightness]] and [[Display resolution|resolution]]. If the scan converter's settings were incorrectly set, as they were at the Goldstone station during the first few minutes of Apollo 11's moonwalk, the negative impact on the image could be very obvious.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} When Armstrong first came down the Lunar Module's ladder, he was barely visible because the contrast and the vertical phase were not set correctly by the scan converter operator.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} The video seen on home television sets was further degraded by the very long and noisy analog transmission path.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} The converted signal was sent by satellite from the three receiving ground stations to Houston, Texas. Then the network [[Press pool|pool feed]] was sent by microwave relay to New York, where it was broadcast live to the United States and the world.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}} Because all of these links were analog, each one added additional noise and distortion to the signal.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}}

===NTSC broadcast tapes===
This low-quality optical conversion of the Apollo 11 moonwalk video images—made with a TV camera taking pictures of a video monitor—is what was widely recorded in real-time onto [[kinescope]] film and NTSC broadcast-quality [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch quadruplex videotape]]. Recordings of this conversion were not lost and have long been available to the public (along with much higher quality video from later [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions). If the one inch data tapes, with the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signals on them, were to be found, modern digital technology would allow for significantly better conversion and processing.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The quality would be similar to what a few technicians and others saw at SSTV receiving ground stations before it got converted to NTSC.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|}}

In 2005, an amateur [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] movie with about 15 minutes of Apollo 11 images was rediscovered. The footage had been taken by Ed von Renouard at Honeysuckle Creek tracking station during or immediately after the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The images show mainly the scan converted monitor and briefly the slow scan monitor.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2008|}} This is some of the best quality recording of brief segments of the Apollo 11 moonwalk available.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The images are available on DVD.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2006|}}

[[File:Apollo11D.jpg|thumb|right|The degraded image after the SSTV scan conversion]]

News that these analog data tapes were missing emerged on August 5, 2006 when the printed and online versions of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published a story with the title ''One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost moon pictures''.{{sfnp|Macey|2006a|}} The missing tapes were among over 700 boxes of magnetic data tapes recorded throughout the Apollo program which have not been found.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|pp=11–12}}  On August 16, 2006 NASA announced its official search saying, "The original tapes may be at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ... or at another location within the NASA archiving system", "NASA engineers are hopeful that when the tapes are found they can use today's digital technology to provide a version of the moonwalk that is much better quality than what we have today."{{sfnp|Macey|2006b|}} NASA also had ongoing research reasons for finding these higher resolution tapes, as the [[Constellation program]] then planned shared some similar tasks with the original Apollo program.{{sfnp|Wheeler|2006|}}

The Goddard Center's Data Evaluation Laboratory has the only known surviving piece of equipment which can read the missing tapes and was set to be closed in October 2006, causing some fear that, even if the tapes were later found, there would be no ready way to read and copy them.{{sfnp|Hansen|2006}} However, equipment that could read the tapes was maintained.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

On November 1, 2006 [[Cosmos (magazine)|''Cosmos'' magazine]] reported that some NASA telemetry tapes from the Apollo project era had been found in a small marine science laboratory within the main physics building at [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]]. One of these tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.{{sfnp| Amalfi |2006|}} It carried no video but did show that if any of the tapes are ever found, data could likely be read from them.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=6}}

== NASA news conference ==
NASA held a news conference at the [[Newseum]], in Washington, D.C. regarding the missing tapes on July 16, 2009 – the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's launch from Cape Kennedy.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} The multinational research team looking into the missing tapes – mostly retired engineers who had worked on the original broadcast in 1969 — was represented at the event by Richard Nafzger from the Goddard Space Flight Center, and Stanley Lebar, the former lead engineer at Westinghouse that developed the Apollo Lunar Camera and the Apollo Color Camera.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} They concluded that the data tapes – with the SSTV signal – were shipped from Australia to Goddard and then routinely erased and reused a few years later.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Australian backup tapes were also erased after Goddard received the reels,{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} following the procedures established by NASA.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes mostly as a backup in case the real-time conversion and broadcast around the world failed. Since the real-time broadcast conversion worked, and was widely recorded on both videotape and [[kinescope|film]], the backup video was not deemed important at the time.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s, NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely that during this period the tapes were erased and reused.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

There was also documentation that the Apollo 11 moonwalk SSTV was recorded at the Parkes, Australia facility on modified Ampex 2-inch helical scan VTRs.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=14}} The VTRs were modified by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Labs to record 320-line slow-scan video directly to the videotape without converting it.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}  It was confirmed that these tapes were shipped to Johns Hopkins University, but could not be found by the search team.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

Nafzger stated that they did find several post-conversion copies of the broadcast that were higher quality than what was previously seen by the public.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Their findings included: a videotape recorded in Sydney after the conversion but before the satellite transmission around the world; videotape from [[CBS News]] archives (direct from NASA, without commentary); and kinescopes at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} At the news conference, it was mentioned that Lowry Digital would complete enhancing and restoring the tapes.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Mike Inchalik, president of Lowry Digital, mentioned that they would only restore the video and not remove defects (such as reflections that looked like flag poles) that their software could remove.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} A few short clips were shown at the news conference, showing their improved quality.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} NASA released some partially restored samples on their website after the news conference.{{sfnp|Jacobs|Hess|2009|}} The full restoration of the footage, about three hours long, was completed in December 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Some other footage from Australian ground station feeds showing SSTV video of Armstrong's descent and first steps surfaced through John Sarkissian's efforts.{{sfnp|SPACE.com Staff|2010|}} Highlights of this fully enhanced video were shown to the public for the first time at the Australian Geographic Society Awards on October 6, 2010, where [[Buzz Aldrin]] was the guest of honor.{{sfnp|Barry|2010|}}{{sfnp|AG Staff|2010|}}

== History ==
ArtTactic was founded in London by Anders Petterson in 2001. In 2004, ArtTactic organized Art Market Forum in conjunction with [[Frieze Art Fair]] and [[Zoo Art Fair]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/news/artnetnews2/artnetnews10-14-04.asp|title=artnet.com Magazine News|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Petterson began lecturing on art as an asset class at [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]] in London. The following year, ArtTactic launched its first Art Market Confidence Survey for the US &amp; European art market. In 2006, ArtTactic published an Artist Analysis Report on contemporary artist [[Richard Prince]], following a successful report on [[Damien Hirst]]. Two years later, ArtTactic published its first Indian Art Market report, presenting its findings at [[Art Dubai]]. In 2009, ArtTactic launched its weekly podcasts, hosted by Adam Green. In 2011, ArtTactic published an Artist Analysis Report on [[Andy Warhol]], which was presented in New York during the inaugural Artelligence Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/04/14/andy-warhol-datapoints-of-the-day/|title=Andy Warhol datapoints of the day|last=Salmon|first=By Felix|website=Reuters Blogs|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first edition of the Art &amp; Finance Report, a co-production between [[Deloitte]] and ArtTactic. The next year, ArtTactic authored the first edition of the [[Hiscox]] Online Art Trade Report. In 2013, ArtTactic published an in-depth, updated Artist Analysis Report on the [[Damien Hirst]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/hirstonomics-how-damien-hirst-became-a-cash-cow-again-8874714.html|title=Hirstonomics: How Damien Hirst became a cash cow again|date=2013-10-11|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, ArtTactic launches ArtForecaster and organizes its first public online forecasting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c2e33f68-94a1-11e3-9146-00144feab7de|title=The Art Market: safe bets vs rising stars|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years afterwards, ArtTactic's Art Market Outlook warns that the art market could start to cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.artmediaagency.com/99656/2015-the-year-that-the-bubble-bursts/|title=2015: The year that the bubble bursts? {{!}} AMA {{!}} Art Media Agency|website=en.artmediaagency.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ArtTactic began publishing ArtTactic Rawfacts, a weekly, monthly and quarterly report on auctions performances at [[Christie's]], [[Sotheby's]] and [[Phillips (auctioneers)|Phillips]], in addition to launching its first online course on Big Data and the Art Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arttactic.teachable.com|title=ArtTactic LAB|website=arttactic.teachable.com|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ArtTactic published its inaugural South Asian Art Market Report in partnership with Rawlinson &amp; Hunter, Constantine Cannon, Gurr Johns and W/R/B Underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anders-petterson/india-art-fair-an-antidote-to-the-increasing-influence-of-aucti/|title=India Art Fair: An Antidote To The Increasing Influence of Auctions|newspaper=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">"'''As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly'''" is an [[aphorism]] which appears in the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Bible]] — [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#26:11|Proverbs 26:11]] ({{Lang-he|כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל־קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו}} ''Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ‘al-qê’ōw; kəsîl, 	šōwneh ḇə’iwwaltōw.''), also partially quoted in the [[New Testament]], [[2 Peter]] 2:22.  It means that fools are stubbornly [[Rigidity (psychology)|inflexible]] and this is illustrated with the repulsive [[simile]] of the [[dog]] that eats its [[vomiting|vomit]] again, even though this may be poisonous.  Dogs were considered [[unclean animals|unclean]] in Biblical times as they were commonly [[scavenger]]s of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures, symbolising evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lj8IXYthLgC|page=354|title=The Book of Proverbs: Chapters 15–31|author=Bruce K. Waltke|isbn=978-0-8028-2776-0|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUEAAAAMAAJ|title=Writing with a purpose|author=James McNab McCrimmon|page=144|isbn=978-0-395-17740-2|year=1973|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/saa/1997/00000005/00000001/art00003|title=Dogs: God's Worst Enemies?|author=Sophia Menache|volume=5|issue=1|year=1997|pages=23–44|doi=10.1163/156853097X00204|journal=Society and Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yz04U3SlSMC&amp;pg=PA92 |year=2008 |title=Animal imagery in the book of Proverbs |isbn=978-90-04-16287-7 |author=Tova Forti |chapter=Dog and Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#27:22|Proverbs 27:22]], "Though you grind a fool in a [[mortar and pestle|mortar]], grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjEYEjVVEosC|title=Dictionary of biblical imagery|author1=Leland Ryken |author2=Jim Wilhoit |author3=James C. Wilhoit |author4=Tremper Longman |author5=Colin Duriez |author6=Douglas Penney |author7=Daniel G. Reid |page=296|isbn=978-0-8308-1451-0|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Proverbs, the "fool" represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and the "wise" represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously. The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context.

==Development==
The Greek translation in the [[Septuagint]] developed the idea, imbuing it with a sense of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes abominable, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin." This was due to the contemporary idea of the fool as [[Bad (ethics)#Christian theology|ungodly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Conceptual Stratification in LXX Prov 26,11: Toward Identifying the Tradents Behind the Aphorism |author=Tova Forti |journal=Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=241–258 |issn=1613-0103 |doi=10.1515/ZAW.2007.019 |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/ZAW.2007.019 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] refers to the proverb ([[s:Bible (King James)/2 Peter#2:22|2 Peter 2:22]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA285 |page=285 |title=Notes, explanatory and practical, on the general epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude |author=Albert Barnes |year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; "But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."  [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] cites this in his poem ''[[The Gods of the Copybook Headings]]'' as one of several classic examples of repeated folly:{{cquote|As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man&lt;br&gt;There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.&lt;br&gt;That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,&lt;br&gt;And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;}}

The proverb is a favourite of the British politician [[Ken Livingstone]] who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/livingstone-vents-his-fury-as-his-bid-to-rejoin-labour-fails-649295.html|title=Livingstone vents his fury as his bid to rejoin Labour fails|author=Paul Waugh|date=24 July 2002|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on occasion in the [[Parliament of Australia]] by [[Paul Keating]], in reference to his political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The half wit, wisdom of a failed intellect | journal=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=Sep 26, 2006 |author=Piers Akerman |quote=In 1990, Paul Keating famously accused Wilson Tuckey of being "a dog returning to its own vomit" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV programme ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'' (the prequel to ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''), in the episode titled "Home," Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father. He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Joyce: "Why did you go back to Oxford?" 
Endeavour: "Oh! A policeman goes where he's sent."
Joyce: "When I told Pop, he just said, ''''Proverbs 26:11'''.'"
Endeavour: [Recognizing the verse] "Well I've many faults, God knows, but I try to draw the line at masochism. Besides, traditionally it's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime, not the... whatever I was."&lt;ref&gt;''Endeavour'', Season 1, Episode, 4 May 5th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">'''Atelier Viking''' is a studio and an [[artist-run initiative]] based in [[Douala]], [[Cameroon]].

Artist [[Viking Kanganyam|Viking Kanganyam André]] founded atelier Viking in March 1976 to promote contemporary art in Cameroon. The paucity of art galleries in Douala encouraged Kanganyam to create a space where artists could be trained and exhibited. Viking taught visual arts (painting, sculpture, graphic art, drawing and serygraphy) to small groups of students. Viking encouraged his students to explore the potentialities of all media and specifically the possibility of transforming and re-using materials found in loco. Concurrently to their activity of visual artists, they worked in advertising. Since 2001, Viking decided to devote his space mostly to exhibitions.  

Atelier Viking is located in the neighbourhood of Bessengue, Rue Jamot face Garage Technique Auto, 100mt from Mobil Bonakouamuang. It collaborates with [[Art Wash]].

[[Image:A Cellier, H J Leslie, B C Stephenson.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Alfred Cellier]], H. J. Leslie and Stephenson, creators of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'']]
'''Benjamin Charles Stephenson''' or '''B. C. Stephenson''' (1839 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist.  After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name "Bolton Rowe".  He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre. His biggest hit was the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', which set records for the length of its original run.

His writing collaborators included [[Clement Scott]] and [[Brandon Thomas]], and composers with whom he worked included [[Frederic Clay]], [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] with whom he wrote ''[[The Zoo]]'', which continues to be revived today.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Stephenson, the son of Sir William Henry Stephenson, came from a family with a history of public service, both civil and military. His grandfather, also named [[Benjamin C. Stephenson|Benjamin Charles Stephenson]], was a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] and later one of the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]].&lt;ref name=general&gt;"Obituary, Major-Gen. Sir B. C. Stephenson", ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Volume 12, July – December 1839, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The general had two sons, one of whom, Frederick, followed him into the army and rose to be a general.  See "Obituary, General Sir F. C. A. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 11 March 1911, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's father became a civil servant, rising to become chairman of the [[Inland Revenue|Board of Inland Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary, Sir William Henry Stephenson", ''The Times'', 2 March 1898, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The young Stephenson was commissioned into the Middlesex Militia&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Morning Post]]'', 31 October 1857, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and later entered the civil service.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;"Obituary, Mr. B. C. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 24 January 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a civil servant, Stephenson began writing theatrical pieces. His grandfather, General B. C. Stephenson, had lived and died at a house in Bolton Row, [[Mayfair]], and the young Stephenson adopted "Bolton Rowe" as his pen name.&lt;ref name=general/&gt; Stephenson's first works were collaborations with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] in three pieces played by amateurs, ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868).  The last of these was repeated at a benefit, produced by [[Thomas German Reed]], at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to Clay and [[W.S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Ages Ago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's first professional success came at the same venue, two years later, with a short [[operetta]], written with the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was in the company's repertory for most of 1872, and was played more than 200 times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 16 November 1872, p. 1; and "Dramatic and Musical Chronology for 1872", ''The Era'', 5 January 1873, supplement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson was still using the pseudonym "Bolton Rowe" when he wrote the libretto for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s one-act [[comic opera]] ''[[The Zoo]]'' in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 6 June 1875, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This work is still played today with some frequency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e. g., [http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/archive_agilbertandsullivandoublebill.htm this information about a 2007 Finborough production]; and Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine vol. 66, Winter 2007 p. 5 about the Charles Court Opera production first performed the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; He then began a writing partnership with [[Clement Scott]], who adopted the matching pen name, "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]], another Mayfair street).&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Together, for the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]], they wrote English versions of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878 as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Scott wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operette, ''Le Petit Duc''. Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===West End and Broadway success===
In 1880, Stephenson's work again featured in New York.  The reopened Broadway Opera House was inaugurated with a double bill of ''Ages Ago'' and ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 28 March 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson also supplied the libretto for a three-act [[grand opera]] version of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''The Masque of Pandora'', composed by Alfred Cellier, and presented in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 1 August 1880, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in London, Stephenson collaborated with [[Brandon Thomas]] on a "new and critical comedy", ''Comrades'', for the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], with a cast including [[Arthur Cecil]], [[Dion Boucicault Jr.|D. G. Boucicault]] and [[Marion Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 December 1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Writing under his real name for the first time, Stephenson had a great success in 1882–83 with his play ''Impulse'', based on ''La Maison du mari'' by [[Xavier de Montépin]], which opened in December 1882 and ran through most of the next year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 December 1882, p. 6; and 18 September 1883, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he adapted ''Der Probepfeil'' by [[Oscar Blumenthal]] as ''A Woman of the World'', which was staged at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], starring [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Helen Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde'', 1 February 1886, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Stephenson had his greatest success. He and Cellier wrote the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''.  The piece opened at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] on 25 September 1886, receiving lukewarm notices.  Much of Cellier's score was reused material from an earlier failure, and neither the music nor the libretto attracted critical praise. ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1886, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier revised the work, and it transferred in December to the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] with new stars, including [[Marie Tempest]].   ''Dorothy'' became a great success at the box office and transferred in 1888 to the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], where it ran until 1889.  Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Gillan, Don.  [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html Longest Running Plays in London and New York, 1875 to 1920] at the Stage Beauty website (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece,&lt;ref&gt;"Dorothy", ''The Times'', 22 December 1908, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights [[David Garrick]] and [[Aphra Behn]], and to [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier later collaborated on another comic opera, ''[[Doris (opera)|Doris]]'' (1888), which, without rivalling ''Dorothy'', had a good run of more than 200 performances.

Stephenson's later work in musical theatre was less successful. For the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] he rewrote the libretto for ''The Golden Web'', an [[opera bouffe]] by the composer [[Arthur Goring Thomas]], which was first heard in 1893.  In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the piece was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;"The Golden Web", ''[[The Musical Times]]'' March 1893, p. 152; and "Facts, Rumours, and Remarks", ''The Musical Times'', January 1893, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, two short operettas with music by [[Edward Jakobowski]], ''The Improvisatore'' and ''A Venetian Singer'', made little impact.&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', September 1893, p. 549 and "Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 11 November 1893, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ranch'', a musical farce with music by [[Edward Solomon]], failed to find a theatre to stage it. A libretto for [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], ''Christopher Patch, The Barber of Bath'', was set by Stanford but has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Frederick. "C. V. Stanford: Nova Bibliographica", ''The Musical Times'', October 1963, pp. 728–31&lt;/ref&gt; A libretto for [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] remained, as McKenzie put it in 1898, "still in my desk".&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Campbell Mackenzie", ''The Musical Times'', June 1898, pp. 369–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In the non-musical theatre, Stephenson continued to prosper. By the 1890s he was sufficiently well known that his name as author of a play lent cachet.  In 1892 one British newspaper protested that a new play, advertised as the work of Stephenson and [[Augustus Harris]], was in fact the work of less-known writers.&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 5 March 1892, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Stephenson produced one of his more enduring works, ''Faithful James'', a one act comedy. It supplanted Gilbert's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'' in a triple bill running at the Court Theatre. The cast included [[Weedon Grossmith]], Brandon Thomas, [[Ellaline Terriss]] and [[Sybil Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among later revivals of the play was one in 1907 with [[Rutland Barrington]] in the title role of the bumbling butler.&lt;ref&gt;"Coronet Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1907, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Stephenson co-wrote a melodrama with [[Charles Haddon Chambers|Haddon Chambers]], ''The Fatal Card'', which was well received.&lt;ref&gt;"Adelphi Theatre: ''The Fatal Card''", ''The Sporting Times'', 8 September 1894, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how he and his collaborator worked together, he said, "We divide the labour. I write all the vowels and Mr Chambers all the consonants."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting Times'', 15 September 1894, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Among revivals of Stephenson's works, during his life and after, were ''Dorothy'' (on several occasions, notably in 1908, when the critic of ''The Times'' called it "one of the most tuneful, most charming, and most shapely of English comic operas") and ''Diplomacy'', which was given in command performances for [[Queen Victoria]] in 1893 and [[George V]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: The Command Performance of ''Diplomacy'', " ''The Times'', 24 January 1914 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived again in 1924, starring [[Gladys Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: Miss Gladys Cooper's New Part: Revival of ''Diplomacy''", ''The Times'', 11 February 1924, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson died in [[Taplow]], [[Berkshire]], at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''''Between Hitler and Stalin:  Ukraine in World War II''''' is a 2003 film produced and directed by [[Slavko Nowytski]] and narrated by [[Jack Palance]]. The one-hour documentary, part black-and-white and part color, is a project of [[Ukrainian Canadian Research and Documentation Centre]] – an attempt to tell the story of [[World War II]] from a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] perspective.

In a chronological manner, Nowytski's film unfolds during the years of [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet–Nazi collaboration]] recounting the losses and suffering of the Ukrainian people; the documentary shifts to the destruction wrought by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s scorched earth policy as the [[Soviet Union military]] retreated, and shows the ruins left behind by the German and then the Soviet offensives.&lt;ref name=ukrweekly&gt;Zakydalsky, Oksana.  [http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2003/450303.shtml Documentary "Between Hitler and Stalin" offers untold story of Ukraine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033316/http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2003/450303.shtml |date=September 30, 2007}}. ''The Ukrainian Weekly''. 9 November 2003, No. 45, Vol. LXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Between Hitler and Stalin'' describes the activity of the underground resistance movements, and specifically the long and large-scale struggle of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) on two fronts, against both totalitarian powers, for [[Ukraine]]'s independence. As Oksana Zakydalsky writes for ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'': "although [World War II is] often called the Russo-German war or described as Russia at war, only parts of Russia were occupied, while all Ukrainian territories were invaded and laid waste by both the Nazi and Soviet war machines. ... The film documents Ukraine's contribution to the war against totalitarianism and the price Ukraine paid for its independence."&lt;ref name=ukrweekly /&gt;

For historical and political commentary, the film relies on [[Norman Davies]], a historian from [[University of London]]; [[Robert Conquest]], a Soviet scholar at [[Hoover Institute]]; John Armstrong, an insurgency expert, and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], a former US National Security Adviser.

The '''Bezold effect''' is an [[optical illusion]], named after a German professor of meteorology, [[Wilhelm von Bezold]] (1837–1907), who discovered that a color may appear different depending on its relation to adjacent colors. 

It happens when small areas of color are interspersed. An assimilation effect called the '''von Bezold spreading effect''', similar to [[spatial color mixing]], is achieved. 

The opposite effect is observed when large areas of color are placed adjacent to each other, resulting in [[color contrast]].

'''Cubism''' is an early-20th-century [[art movement]] which brought European [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] historically forward toward 20th century [[Modern art]]. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in [[literature]] and [[architecture]]. Cubism has been considered to be among the most influential art movements of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection, ''Cubism, Introduction'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A.

The movement was pioneered by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], joined by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA collection ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', from Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613022945/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541 |date=2014-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813112047/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1 |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. In other countries [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and [[Art Deco]] developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544 |date=2015-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195#skipToContent Christina Lodder, 2009, ''Constructivism, Formation, 1914–21'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234226/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10955&amp;section_id=T019195 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.

==History==
Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as ''Analytic Cubism'', a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 784. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, ''Synthetic Cubism'', remained vital until around 1919, when the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement gained popularity. English [[art historian]] [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, ''The Cubist Epoch''. According to Cooper there was "Early Cubism", (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called "High Cubism", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

===Proto-Cubism: 1907-1908===
{{main|Proto-Cubism}}
Cubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], in ''Gil Blas'', 25 March 1909, to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]] referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'', as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in [[Paris]] during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque’s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But "this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists," wrote the art historian Christopher Green: "Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]"&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] as early as 1920,&lt;ref&gt;D.-H. Kahnweiler. Der Weg zum Kubismus (Munich, 1920; Eng. trans., New York, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Greenberg. ‘The Pasted-paper Revolution’, ARTnews, 57 (1958), pp. 46–9, 60–61; repr. as ‘Collage’ in Art and Culture (Boston, 1961), pp. 70–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the "Salle 41" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the "Salle 41" artists, e.g., [[Francis Picabia]]; the brothers [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the [[Section d'Or]] (or the [[Puteaux Group]]); the sculptors [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] as well as [[Jacques Lipchitz]] and [[Henri Laurens]]; and painters such as [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[František Kupka]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Léopold Survage]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[André Lhote]], [[Gino Severini]] (after 1916), [[María Blanchard]] (after 1916) and [[Georges Valmier]] (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were "later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation."&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

[[John Berger]] identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. "The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Moment of Cubism|year=1969|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780297177098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Cubism: 1909-1914 ===
[[File:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Albert Gleizes]], ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Completed the same year that Albert Gleizes co-authored the book ''Du "Cubisme"'' with Jean Metzinger. Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913]]
There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Salmon]]. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=November 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1910 Salon d'Automne, a few months later, Metzinger exhibited his highly fractured ''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', which was subsequently reproduced in both ''Du "Cubisme"'' (1912) and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The first public controversy generated by Cubism resulted from Salon showings at the Indépendants during the spring of 1911. This showing by Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. Amongst the Cubist works presented, Robert Delaunay exhibited his ''Eiffel Tower, Tour Eiffel'' (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1022 Robert Delaunay, Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel), 1911 (dated 1910 by the artist).

At the Salon d'Automne of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of ''Salle 41'', were exhibited works by [[André Lhote]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Jacques Villon, [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[František Kupka]]. The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of ''The New York Times''. This article was published a year after [[Gelett Burgess]]' ''The Wild Men of Paris'',&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris: Matisse, Picasso, and Les Fauves'', Architectural Record, May 1910] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424182236/http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years prior to the [[Armory Show]], which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 ''New York Times'' article portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon.

:"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "Cubist" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

:In spite of the crazy nature of the "Cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

:What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?"&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times" /&gt;

The subsequent 1912 Salon des Indépendants was marked by the presentation of Marcel Duchamp's ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the Cubists. It was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other Cubists. Although the work was shown in the Salon de la Section d'Or in October 1912 and the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120|3 Philadelphia Museum of Art, Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063503/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51449.html?mulR=24120%7C3 |date=2017-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Gris, a new addition to the Salon scene, exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso'' (Art Institute of Chicago), while Metzinger's two showings included ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' 1911-1912 ([[National Gallery of Denmark]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ Statens Museum for Kunst, National Gallery of Denmark, Jean Metzinger, ''Woman with a Horse'', 1911–1912, oil on canvas, 162 x 130 cm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115151153/http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/french-art-1900-1930/highlights/jean-metzinger-woman-with-a-horse/ |date=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaunay's monumental ''La Ville de Paris'' (Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris) and Léger's ''La Noce, The Wedding'' (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris) were also exhibited.

The Cubist contribution to the [[Salon d'Automne#1912.2C political ramifications|1912 Salon d'Automne]] created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the [[Grand Palais]], to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician [[Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué]] made the front page of ''Le Journal'', 5 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7625001c/f1.image ''M.

It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070918235710/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-oeuvre.html Fondation Gleizes, Son Oeuvre]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works exhibited were [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]]'s vast composition ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears)'' now at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, [[Joseph Csaky]]'s ''Deux Femme, Two Women'' (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by Kupka, ''Amorpha'' (The National Gallery, Prague), and [[Picabia]], ''La Source, The Spring'' (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

====Abstraction and the ready-made====
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1912, Les Fenêtres simultanée sur la ville (Simultaneous Windows on the City), 40 x 46 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, 46 x 40 cm, [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]], an example of ''Abstract Cubism'']]
The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially [[František Kupka]], and those considered [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]] by [[Apollinaire]] (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, ''Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs'' and ''Amorpha chromatique chaude'', were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'', followed by a series entitled ''Formes Circulaires'', in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled ''Contrasts of Forms'', giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in ''Les Peintres cubistes'' (1913),&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; writing of a new "pure" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The ''Section d'Or'', also known as ''Groupe de Puteaux'', founded by some of the most conspicuous Cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. The ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' at the ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=2013-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group seems to have adopted the name Section d'Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] in the [[Montmartre]] quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the [[golden ratio]] had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403151309/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+num%C3%A9ro+sp%C3%A9cial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg |date=2017-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Codex Urbinas|Trattato della Pittura]]'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]].

The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had developed, and that ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism" /&gt;

===Late Cubism: 1914-1921===
{{main|Crystal Cubism}}

====Crystal Cubism: 1914-1918====

A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y Christopher Green, ''Cubism and Its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=e7ZuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Christopher+Green,+%27%27Cubism+and+Its+Enemies:+Modern+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gliFVJKzJcizUe3AghA&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2016-01-01 }}'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, {{ISBN|0300034687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

====Cubism after 1918====
[[File:Picasso three musicians moma 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Three Musicians]]'' (1921), [[Museum of Modern Art]]. ''Three Musicians'' is a classic example of Synthetic cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78630 |title=The Museum of Modern Art |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most innovative period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of [[geometric abstraction]] and [[Surrealism]] in [[Paris]]. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and the Englishman [[Ben Nicholson]]. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler’s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called [[Neoclassicism]]) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards [[conservatism]] in both [[French culture|French]] society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] or [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealizing|Naturalism]], [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and abstraction could be compared.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

==Interpretation==
===Intentions and criticism===
[[File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|[[Juan Gris]], ''Portrait of Picasso'', 1912, oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
The Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. "It is by no means clear, in any case," wrote Christopher Green, "to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne." The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of ''simultaneity'',&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]], [[Maurice Princet]], and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. [[Perspective (graphical)|Linear perspective]] developed during [[the Renaissance]] was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or [[relative motion]]) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Gleizes' monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'', exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, Le Fauconnier’s ''Abundance'' shown at the Indépendants of 1911, and Delaunay's ''City of Paris'', shown at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s ''The Wedding'', also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], Gino Severini and [[Carlo Carrà]]; themselves made in response to early Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations" /&gt;

Cubism and [[modern art|modern European art]] was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]], which then traveled to [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In the Armory show [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited ''La Femme au pot de moutarde'' (1910), the sculpture ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' (1909–10), ''Les Arbres'' (1907) amongst other cubist works. [[Jacques Villon]] exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother [[Marcel Duchamp]] shocked the American public with his painting ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). [[Francis Picabia]] exhibited his abstractions ''La Danse à la source'' and ''La Procession, Seville'' (both of 1912). [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibited ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux phlox]]'' (1910) and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|L'Homme au balcon]]'' (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. [[Georges Braque]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[Alexander Archipenko]] also contributed examples of their cubist works.

===Stylistic interpretation===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering [[African culture|African]], Polynesian, [[Micronesia]]n and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[primitivism]], [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture, [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[Proto-Cubism|Protocubism]], as notably seen in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24" /&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 163.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Quarry Bibémus'', 1898-1900, [[Museum Folkwang]], [[Essen]], [[Germany]]]]
The art historian Douglas Cooper states that [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] "were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907".&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say: "The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, [[expressionist]] element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it."&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"/&gt;

The most serious objection to regarding the ''Demoiselles'' as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that "such deductions are unhistorical", wrote the art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]]. This familiar explanation "fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both [[Les Nabis]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat]] (e.g., ''Parade de Cirque'', ''[[Le Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque]]''), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by [[binocular vision]], and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.

Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, and published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]''. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote Daniel Robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The traditional interpretation of "Cubism", formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as [[Jean Metzinger]], Albert Gleizes, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The history of the term "Cubism" usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to "cubes" in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in a similar context. However, the word "cube" was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:

::"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. [[Paul Signac|Signac]] but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''Les Artistes Indépendants, 1906'', Quelques Petits Salons. Paris, 1908. Chassevent discussed Delaunay and Metzinger in terms of Signac's influence, referring to Metzinger's "precision in the cut of his cubes..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical use of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'', commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments." (Robert Herbert, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; In 1911, the poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''&lt;ref&gt;A. Gleizes and J. Metzinger. Du "Cubisme", Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (Eng. trans., London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201712x/f1.image Fritz-R.

The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in [[Puteaux]] and [[Courbevoie]]. It mirrored the attitudes of the "artists of Passy", which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The concept developed in ''Du "Cubisme"'' of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=Cubism%2C%20mobile%20perspective&amp;f=false David Cottington, 2004, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=fr |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1912 manifetso ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Metzinger and Gleizes was followed in 1913 by ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'', a collection of reflections and commentaries by Guillaume Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire"&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Les Peintres cubistes: Méditations esthétiques'' (Paris, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire had been closely involved with Picasso beginning in 1905, and Braque beginning in 1907, but gave as much attention to artists such as Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Picabia, and Duchamp.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

{{main|Cubist sculpture}}

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].

Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'' with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch" /&gt; These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by [[Alexander Archipenko]] in 1912–13, for example in ''Woman Walking''.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and then in 1914 by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism," Readings in Art History 2 (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Edith Balas, 1998, Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, American Philosophical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101225927/https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky |date=2016-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial Cubist innovation. It was the stimulus behind the proto-Constructivist work of both [[Naum Gabo]] and [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

Cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy"&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/architecture-and-cubism-1.html Architecture and Cubism, Eve Blau, Nancy J.

Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Blau &amp; Troy" /&gt;

Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (''La Maison Cubiste'', by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]]) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]], with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020551#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, II.

Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of "a profound reorientation towards a changed world".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Banham. Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (London, 1960), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubo-Futurist ideas of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential [[De Stijl]] movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by [[Piet Mondrian]] under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by [[Gino Severini]] to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as [[Le Corbusier]],) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published ''Après le cubisme'' in 1918.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, Architecture" /&gt; Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.&lt;ref&gt;Choay, Françoise, ''le corbusier'' (1960), pp. 10-11.

At the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''Maison Cubiste'' (Cubist House), signed [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written during the assemblage of the "Maison Cubiste", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinge, except from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602141918/http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf |date=2013-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&amp;f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130140743/https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-hGOpwJc&amp;sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&amp;hl=en |date=2016-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (''Woman with a Fan''), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom.

===Czech Cubist architecture===
[[File:Dům U černé Matky Boží 02.JPG|thumb|[[House of the Black Madonna]] in Prague, built by [[Josef Gočár]] in 1912]]
The original Cubist architecture is very rare. There is only one country in the world where Cubism was really applied to architecture – namely [[Bohemia]] (today [[Czech Republic]]) and especially its capital, [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=bonek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boněk|first1=Jan|title=Cubist Prague|date=2014|publisher=Eminent|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-7281-469-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cztourism&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubism|url=https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|website=www.czechtourism.com|publisher=CzechTourism|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016060851/https://www.czechtourism.com/p/cubism-editorial/|archivedate=16 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech architects were the first and only ones in the world to ever design original Cubist buildings.&lt;ref name=radioprague&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubist architecture|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|website=www.radio.cz|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911055421/http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/cubism|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910–1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the [[World War I]]. After the war, the architectural style called ''Rondo-Cubism'' was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.&lt;ref name=czkubista&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Cubism|url=http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html#|website=www.kubista.cz|publisher=Kubista|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008123014/http://www.kubista.cz/en/cubism/profiles.html|archivedate=8 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:104 Vil·la Kovařovic (casa cubista), façana de Rašínovo Nábřeží.jpg|thumb|Villa Kovařovic in Prague by [[Josef Chochol]]]]
In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called [[diamond cut]], or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late [[Gothic architecture]]. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. [[hexagonal window]]s.&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.

The leading Cubist architects were [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]], [[Emil Králíček]] and [[Josef Chochol]].&lt;ref name=czkubista/&gt; They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the [[House of the Black Madonna]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient.&lt;ref name=bonek/&gt; Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of [[Ďáblice cemetery|Ďáblice Cemetery]] in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under [[Vyšehrad]]. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the [[Wenceslas Square]], designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the [[New Town of Prague]] around 1913.

==Cubism in other fields==
The influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of [[Gertrude Stein]] employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.

In the field of American fiction, [[William Faulkner]]'s 1930 novel ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.

The poets generally associated with Cubism are [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]]. As American poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] explains, Cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenneth Rexroth |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |title=The Cubist Poetry of Pierre Reverdy (Rexroth) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519035242/http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/essays/reverdy.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] was profound; [[Louis Aragon]], founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |title=Title Page &gt; Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets [[John Ashbery]] and [[Ron Padgett]] have recently produced new translations of [[Pierre Reverdy|Reverdy's]] work. [[Wallace Stevens]]' "[[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird]]" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813070622/http://titan.iwu.edu/~wchapman/americanpoetryweb/stevthir.html Illinois Wesleyan University - The American Poetry Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Days of Glory''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Indigènes''' - "Natives"}}; {{lang-ar|بلديون}}) is a [[2006 in film|2006]] French film directed by  [[Rachid Bouchareb]]. The cast includes [[Sami Bouajila]], [[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Mélanie Laurent]] and [[Bernard Blancan]].

The film deals with the contribution of [[North African]] soldiers to the [[Free French Forces]] during the [[Second World War]] and, controversially, with the discrimination against them. The film's release contributed to a partial recognition of the pension rights of soldiers from former French possessions by the French government.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-days6dec06,0,4303771.story 'Days of Glory' MOVIE REVIEW - Los Angeles Times], [[Kenneth Turan]], December 6, 2006, retrieved 2007-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Sami Bouajila]] and [[Bernard Blancan]] won the ''[[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Prix d'interprétation masculine]]'' at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4352781/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Days of Glory |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

== Plot==
In [[French North Africa]] in 1943 large numbers of men from [[French colonial empire|France's overseas possessions]] have been recruited into the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]] of the [[Free French Forces]] to fight alongside the other [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against [[Nazi Germany]] and liberate France from [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation]]. The army consists of two main elements: ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', that is people of mostly [[European diaspora|European]] descent, and ''[[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigènes]]'', those of mostly African descent. The "indigènes" in turn consist of three main groups: [[Demographics of Algeria|Algerians]], [[Moroccans]] (known as ''[[Moroccan Goumier|goumiers]])'', and troops from [[Sub-Sahara Africa]].

Saïd, an impoverished goat herder, joins the [[7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment|7th RTA]] (Régiment de Tirailleurs Algériens). With him are other Algerians including Messaoud, who wants to marry and settle in France, and the literate Corporal Abdelkader, who seeks equality with settlers for the indigenous people of his country. There are also two Moroccan brothers Yassir and Larbi, Yassir's aim being booty so that Larbi can afford to marry. 
 
Soon the men, dressed in mostly [[lend-lease]] [[U.S. Army M1943 Uniform|American uniforms]] meet Sergeant Martinez, a battle-hardened ''pied-noir'', who trains them before leading them on their first engagement against the Germans in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. Their mission is to capture a heavily-defended mountain, but it soon becomes clear that their white commanding officer is using them as [[cannon fodder]] to identify [[artillery]] targets. The colonial troops eventually succeed, at the cost of high casualties. When asked by a French war correspondent about his thoughts on the losses, the white colonel replies, "today was a great victory for the Free French Forces".
 
The troops of the 7th RTA next embark for [[Operation Dragoon]], to liberate the south of France.&lt;ref name=c4&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=160750 Days of Glory (2006) Channel 4 Film review], retrieved 2007-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; While aboard ship, a white cook refuses to give tomatoes to black soldiers. Abdelkader calls for equality, but mutiny is averted when Martinez and the company captain promise that everyone will be treated the same.

On arrival at [[Marseille]], the colonial troops are greeted as heroes. Messaoud meets and courts Irène, a French woman, promising when the regiment leaves that he will write and one day return. She says she'll wait for him and they will marry. However, due to censorship of soldiers' mail, Irène never learns Messaoud's fate.

Saïd becomes Martinez's [[Batman (military)|orderly]], for which the other soldiers call him "girlie" and imply he's gay. Eventually he snaps and holds a knife to Messaoud's throat. Abdelkader calms the situation, but Saïd makes it clear that in this [[racial segregation|segregated]] world the French authorities will not give their colonial soldiers anything. Having seen among Martinez's possessions a family photograph, while drinking with the sergeant Saïd mentions that the two of them are similar in both having an Arab mother. The NCO attacks him and threatens to kill him if he reveals this secret.

The colonial troops discover that, while they are not granted leave, white members of the Free French Forces are allowed trips home. Eventually the men are told they will be going home, but it's a ruse; instead, they are billeted behind the lines and given a [[ballet]] performance. Bored and disillusioned, most leave the tent and hold a meeting outside decrying the injustice. Martinez challenges the group, led by Abdelkader, and a fight starts.

Early next morning, French [[National Gendarmerie|military police]] bring Messaoud to a temporary [[stockade]] where Abdelkader is also being held. Messaoud says he was arrested for trying to go back to Marseille and find Irène. Abdelkader is brought before the white colonel who tells him that he needs him to go on a special mission: to take ammunition to American troops fighting in the [[Lorraine Campaign]] and also be the first French troops to liberate [[Alsace]]. The white officer promises that Abdelkader and the other colonial soldiers will get the rewards and recognition that success in this operation will bring. Later, the white company captain tells the corporal that the colonel will keep his word.

Most of the men are killed by a booby trap, including Yassir's brother, as they cross the German lines, and Martinez is severely injured. The survivors mostly want to go back, but Abdelkader rallies them to push on. Eventually the corporal, Saïd, Messaoud, Yassir and the wounded Martinez reach an Alsatian village. Over the next few days the soldiers ingratiate themselves into the area and Saïd befriends a [[milkmaid]]. A battle begins when a unit of Germans arrives, and everyone except Abdelkader is killed. Messaoud is badly hurt by a [[Panzerschreck]] rocket and then shot by a German rifleman. Saïd attempts to evacuate Martinez, but they are both shot by the Panzerschreck, killing Saïd and further wounding Martinez, who is quickly finished off. Abdelkader and Yassir attempt to flee, but Yassir is shot in the back by a German. However, just as the corporal is cornered, more colonial troops arrive and drive the Germans out of the village.

As columns of Free French forces begin to move through the area, Abdelkader sees the colonel passing in his jeep, but the white commanding officer ignores him and he is pulled away by a staff officer who asks him where his unit is. When Abdelkader says they are all dead, he is simply assigned to another white NCO. As he walks out of the village, he passes a film cameraman filming only white troops standing by the liberated villagers.

The movie then moves to the present day. An elderly Abdelkader goes to a war cemetery in Alsace to visit the graves of his comrades: Martinez, Saïd, Yassir and Messaoud. He then returns to his small rundown flat in modern-day France. The film concludes with the caption that from 1959 pensions for servicemen from France's overseas possessions living in France enjoyed no increases after the date their country of origin became independent.

==Modern relevance==
While each has his own motives, these native Africans have enlisted to fight for a France they have never seen. In the words of ''[[Le Chant des Africains]]'' the four actors sing within the film, "we come from the colonies to save the motherland, we come from afar to die, we are the men of Africa." The film shows a complex depiction of their treatment in an army organisation prejudiced in favour of the European French.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

The discrimination by the French authorities against these soldiers continued as successive French governments froze the war pensions of these indigenous veterans when their countries became independent. The closing credits of the film state that, despite the ruling that [[war pension]]s should be paid in full, successive French administrations since 2002 had not done so. It was only after the film's release that the government policy was changed to bring foreign combatant pensions into line with what French veterans are paid.&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;[[The Independent]] {{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/film-moves-chirac-to-back-down-over-war-pensions-417581.html |title=Film moves Chirac to back down over war pensions |date=2006-09-26|accessdate=2008-08-24 | work=The Independent | location=London | first=John | last=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as of 2010, no war pension in arrears (almost 40 years) have been considered.

In 2009, the [[BBC]] published documentary evidence that showed black colonial soldiers - who together with North African troops made up around two-thirds of Free French forces - were deliberately removed from the units that led the Allied advance to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]] in 1944. General [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear that he wanted Free French troops to enter the French capital first. In response [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Allied Command]] therefore insisted that all black soldiers should be replaced by white and North African ones from other French units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7984436.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Paris liberation made 'whites only'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian T. Jackson|Julian Jackson]] : "Once Vichy-ite Algeria had been conquered by the Allies, de Gaulle was finally allowed to go there, in May 1943. Now [[Algiers]] replaced London and [[Brazzaville]] as the capital of the Free French. Even more important was the fact that Algeria contained an important reservoir of North African troops. At the end of 1942 de Gaulle's total forces never numbered more than 50,000, but now, in 1943, thanks to Algeria, he had an army of about half a million men. This multi-racial army was first thrown into battle in Italy in 1943 - it fought at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] - then landed with Americans in southern France in August 1944. But the Americans and British were agreed that for symbolic reasons the French should also be involved in operations in Normandy - for this reason the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]] of [[General Leclerc|Leclerc]] was sent over to Britain from northern France, - in the words of one senior American general it was, 'the only French division which could be made 100% white'...Even if it was not at de Gaulle's instigation, it doesn't seem he particularly objected to this white-washing of the last stages of the Free French epic. The French were quick to forget that it was thanks to their colonial soldiers that they had any claim to have re-entered the war in 1944 as a great power." &lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, BBC Radio Three, ''The Other Empire'' episode 3/5, first broadcast 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
[[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Sami Bouajila]] and [[Bernard Blancan]] won the ''[[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Prix d'interprétation masculine]]'' at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"/&gt;

The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], but lost to ''[[The Lives of Others]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Design by committee''' is a disparaging term for a project that has many designers involved but no unifying plan or vision.

==Usage==
The term is used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants, particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge, such as needless complexity, internal inconsistency, logical flaws, banality, and the lack of a unifying vision.  This democratic design process is in contrast to autocratic design, or [[design by dictator]], where the project leader decides on the design. The difference is that in an autocratic style, members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader.

The term is especially common in technical [[parlance]]; it legitimizes the need and general acceptance of a unique [[systems architect]] and stresses the need for technical quality over political feasibility. The proverb "[[wikt:too many cooks spoil the broth|too many cooks spoil the broth]]" expresses the same idea.

The term is commonly used in [[information and communications technology]], especially when referring to the design of languages and technical standards, as demonstrated by [[USENET]] archives.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://groups.google.co.uk/groups/search?safe=off&amp;q=%22design+by+committee%22&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=1&amp;as_maxm=1&amp;as_maxy=1993 Occurrences of "Design by committee" in Google Groups USENET archives, 1981–1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a technical decision said to be a typical result of design by committee is the [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) cell size of 53 bytes. The choice of 53 bytes was political rather than technical.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stevenson, "Electropolitical Correctness and High-Speed Networking, or, Why ATM is like a Nose", [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Asynchronous-Transfer-Networks-Yannis-Viniotis/dp/0306444860 Proceedings of TriCom '93], April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload. Parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length of 32 bytes. A 53-byte size (48 bytes plus 5 byte header) was the compromise chosen.

The term is also common in other fields of design such as graphic design, architecture or industrial design. In automotive design, this process is often blamed for unpopular or poorly designed cars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/10/AR2005061002188.html Biggest Automaker Needs Big Changes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example described as naming by community was a school near [[Liverpool]] formed by the merger of several other schools: it was officially named the "Knowsley Park Centre for Learning, Serving Prescot, Whiston and the Wider Community" in 2009, listing as a compromise all the schools and communities merged into it.&lt;ref name="Knowsley school to have one of “longest names in the world”"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Ben|title=Knowsley school to have one of “longest names in the world”|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/knowsley-school-one-longest-names-3455658|website=[[Liverpool Echo]]|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name lasted seven years before its headmistress, who called the name "so embarrassing"&lt;ref name="Can a new drive change the fortunes of schools in one of Britain’s most deprived areas?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|title=Can a new drive change the fortunes of schools in one of Britain’s most deprived areas?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/13/education-schools-liverpool-knowsley|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cut it to simply "[[Prescot School]]".&lt;ref name="The making of an education catastrophe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cobain|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Cobain|title=The making of an education catastrophe – schools in Knowsley were dubbed 'wacky warehouses'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/29/knowsley-education-catastrophe-a-levels-merseyside|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowsley’s schools letters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lessons to be learned from Knowsley’s schools (letters)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/06/lessons-to-be-learned-from-knowsleys-schools|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One maxim is that ''a camel is a horse designed by committee''; this phrase has appeared in use in the United States as early as the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The '''Diana and Actaeon basin''' or '''Basin with Scenes from the Myth of Diana and Actaeon''' is a 1613 silver bowl produced by the Dutch silversmith [[Paul van Vianen]]. It shows scenes from the myth of [[Diana and Actaeon]], with a border in the [[Auricular style]]. It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, which acquired it in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/BK-16089-A Rijsmuseum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''enfield''' is a fictitious creature sometimes used in [[heraldry]].

==Description==
The Enfield has the head of a fox, forelegs like an [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]'s talons, {{citation needed span|text=the chest of a [[greyhound]], the body of a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]]|date=May 2018|reason=These two animals are not referenced in text on this page quoted from the same source.}}, and the hindquarters and tail of a [[wolves in heraldry|wolf]].&lt;ref name="ulsterking"/&gt;

==O'Kelly==
The earliest known example of the enfield is the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Kelly (surname)|Ó Cellaigh]] clan of Ireland. Ó Cellaigh of [[Uí Maine]] are the most documented O'Kelly sept in early Irish history and annals. The enfield appears in ''[[Leabhar Ua Maine]]''.

The ancient tradition among the O'Kellys is that they have borne this fabulous animal since the days of King [[Tadhg Mór Ua Cellaigh]] who fell "fighting like a wolf dog" on the side of the High King of Ireland, [[Brian Boru]], at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014.  When Tadhg Mor fell this mythical beast issued from the nearby sea to protect the dead body of the chief until it was retrieved for proper burial by his kinsmen.

The animal is sculptured on many old ({{circa|1375}}&amp;ndash;1650) tombstones of the O'Kelly family in the Abbey of [[Kilconnell]] (founded ca.&amp;thinsp;1353 by King [[William Buidhe Ó Cellaigh]]), and in the old church of Cloonkeen.

In 1859, an excavation project found a bronze 15th century O'Kelly seal 20&amp;nbsp;ft deep in a bog, prompting considerable research on the origins of the O'Kelly enfield on the seal:

{{quote|I have searched in several works  on heraldry for a description of the enfield, but without success. It does not appear to be a cognizance of much in use, and it does not appear to be found in [[John Guillim|Gwillam]]'s "Display of Heraldry" folio: not even in Cap 26 of that book, which chapter treats solely of fictitious creatures, supposed to be compounded of different kinds and natures, such as [[Griffon]]s, [[Wivern]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[cockatrice]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[mermaid]]s. Neither is the term enfield given or explained in Crossley's "Signification of things borne in Heraldry". To my gifted friend, Sir [[Bernard Burke]], [[Ulster King of Arms]], I, however am indebted for the following definition of this composite fabulous creature, viz. :— "The Enfield is a heraldic animal, having the head of a fox, the breast feathered as an eagle's, the foreclaws also of an eagle; the remainder of the body that of a wolf." It follows from such description that the enfield, being compounded of the fox, eagle, and wolf, indicated that he, by whom it was borne, was reputed to possess the subtlety and cunning of the first named beast; the magnanimity and fortitude, with the honour, labor, industry, and diligence, in great manners, of the eagle; and the fierceness of the wolf.&lt;ref name="ulsterking"&gt;''The Journal of the Kilkenny and southeast of Ireland archaeological society'', Vol II, 1858&amp;ndash;1859, Dublin, University Press, McGlashan &amp; Gill, p448&amp;ndash;449.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern uses==
The beast was on the coat of arms of the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]], which was amalgamated with the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] to form the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. It is unclear whether the beast has any historic connection with the town, but it still makes a striking example of [[canting arms]]. It is used on the modern [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield]] and as an emblem by some organisations there: for example, on the badges of Enfield County School, [[Chace Community School]], Enfield Ignatians R.F.C. and of the football clubs [[Enfield (1893) F.C.]] and [[Enfield Town F.C.]], as well as [[Oneida FC]].

In Australia, it was used in the crest of the former [[City of Enfield]], [[South Australia]] (which was named after the London borough), and is still used by the Enfield Brass Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.enfieldbrass.org.au/contact |title=Enfield Brass: Contact |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as the centrepiece of the squadron crest of [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|38 Squadron]] of the Royal Australian Air Force, in [[Queensland]].

== History ==
The Orange Order was founded in 1795 to commemorate the Protestant [[William III of England|King William III of England, Scotland and Ireland]]'s victory in the [[Glorious Revolution]] against the [[Roman Catholic]] [[James II of England|King James II]]. The flag was adopted shortly afterwards on the grounds that it was purportedly the flag that King William had used as his personal standard at the [[Battle of the Boyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Derek |last=Gregory |title=Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence |page=9 |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=1135929068}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Irish Unionist Party]]'s [[Sir Edward Carson]] marched behind the flag of the Orange Order from [[Ulster Hall]] in leading people to publicly sign the [[Ulster Covenant]] at [[Belfast City Hall]] against the [[Irish Home Rule Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/about-ulster-covenant |title=About the Ulster Covenant |publisher=nidirect |date= |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were reenacted 100 years later in 2012 including a number of Northern Ireland's unionist political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-19769173/n-ireland-s-first-minister-at-ulster-covenant-re-enactment |title=N Ireland's first minister at Ulster Covenant re-enactment |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Newbuildings flags.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The flag is associated with [[Ulster loyalism]].]]
The flag is used officially by the Orange Order and is also carried on [[Orange walk]]s predominantly on [[The Twelfth]] of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/its-colours-they-are-fine-all-over-the-world-28770480.html |title=Its colours they are fine – all over the world |work=Belfast Telegraph |date= |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used by [[Ulster Loyalist|Loyalist]] flute bands independent of the Orange Order when they are participating in Orange walks or other Loyalist order parades.&lt;ref name=wc /&gt; Usually the flying of the flag of the Orange Order is not prohibited during marches by the [[Parades Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.causewaycoastcommunity.co.uk/local-news/dervock-young-defenders-banned-from-attending-parade-in-rasharkin/ |title=Dervock Young Defenders banned from attending parade in Rasharkin |work=Causeway Coast News |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In past times, the flag was also waved by fans of the Scottish association football team [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at their club matches as their club has historical links with the Orange Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pat |last=Woods |title=Oh, Hampden in the Sun.... |chapter=Fans in the 50s|publisher=Random House |year=2013 |isbn=1780578008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Orange Order adopted a new logo based upon the flag of the Orange Order.

'''French standard sizes for [[oil painting]]s''' refers to a series of different sized [[Canvas|canvases]] for use by artists. The sizes were fixed in the 19th century. Most artists{{Weasel inline|date=February 2017}}—not only French—used this standard, as it was supported by the main suppliers of [[Art materials|artist materials]]. Only some contemporary artist material suppliers continue to use these standards today, as most artists no longer differentiate canvas sizes by subject.

The main separation from size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate runs for faces/portraits (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage''), and marines (''marine'') which more or less keep the diagonal. That is, a ''figure 0'' corresponds in height to a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen.

In modern times in the USA size is usually stated height by width, where as in this article it is width by height.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}Early examples of the use of garden ornaments in western culture were seen in [[Roman gardens|Ancient Roman gardens]] such as those excavated at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. The [[Italian Renaissance garden]] and [[French formal garden]] styles were the peak of using created forms in the garden and landscape, with [[high art]] and [[kitsch]] interpretations ever since. The [[Landscape garden|English landscape garden]] expanded the scale of some garden ornaments to temple [[folly|follies]]

The Asian tradition of making garden ornaments, often functioning in association with [[Feng Shui]] principles, has a nearly timeless history. [[Chinese garden]]s with [[Chinese scholar's rocks]], [[Korean stone art]], and [[Japanese garden]]s with [[Suiseki]] and Zen rock gardens have and symbolic meaning and natural ornamental qualities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2241">'''Isabella Edenshaw''' (1842 &amp;ndash; 1926) was a [[First Nations]] basket weaver who lived in [[Haida Gwaii]]. She was given this name by an [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest when she was married. She is also known by the [[Haida language|Haida]] names '''K'woiyeng''', '''Yahgujanaas''' and '''S'itkwuns'''. Some sources list her birth year as 1858.&lt;ref name=cwahi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/exhibitions/charles-edenshaw-the-raven-the-sea-bear-and-other-stories |title=Charles Edenshaw: The Raven, The Sea Bear and Other Stories |work=NGC Magazine |date=March 3, 2014 |publisher=National Gallery of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Klukwan, Alaska|Klukwan Village]], [[Alaska]], a member of the Yakulanas lineage of the [[Haida people|Haida]] clan. Her parents died of [[smallpox]] when she was young and she was raised by chief Albert Edward Edenshaw. Around 1873, she was married to artist [[Charles Edenshaw]]; the couple had eleven children. She wove [[spruce]] roots into baskets and hats which were later painted by her husband. Her work appeared in the exhibitions ''Raven Travelling: Two Centuries of Haida Art'' at the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] and ''Signed Without Signature'' at the British Columbia [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]].&lt;ref name=cwahi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/fp/fpz2a18e.shtml |title=Isabella Edenshaw (1858-1926) |work=An Aboriginal Presence |publisher=Canadian Museum of History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her woven baskets and hats are included in the collections of the [[McCord Museum]], the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the BC Museum of Anthropology.&lt;ref name=cwahi/&gt;

'''Light Work''' is a photography center in [[Syracuse, New York]]. The artist-run nonprofit supports photographers through a community-access digital lab facility, residencies, exhibitions, and publications.

== History ==

The organization is housed at [[Syracuse University]] in the [[Robert B. Menschel]] Media Center. Founding directors Phil Block and Tom Bryan established it in 1973 and Jeffrey Hoone has led Light Work since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/09/light_work_celebrates_40_years.html Light Work celebrates 40 years with exhibition from its collection and reception on Sept. 26 | syracuse.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its programs are supported by [[National Endowment for the Arts]]; [[New York State Council on the Arts]]; Robert and Joyce Menschel; Vital Projects Fund, Inc.; Syracuse University; Central New York Community Foundation; Joy of Giving Something, Inc., as well as by local subscribers.

[[Autograph ABP]], the Community Folk Art Center, [[En Foco]], the [[Everson Museum of Art]], the Red House Art Center, the Urban Video Project (UVP), and others are collaborative partners of the center.

== Artists-in-residence program ==

Light Work annually invites a dozen or more artists to Syracuse to work on new projects. Residency includes a stipend, a furnished apartment, staff support, and access to its facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/11/lightwork_2014_artist_in_residence.html Light Work announces 2014 artists-in-residence | syracuse.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
New work by artists-in-residence is published in a special edition of the center's magazine, ''Contact Sheet: The Light Work Annual'', including an essay commissioned by Light Work. Work by former artists-in-residence is also part of the Light Work collection. To date, more than 360 artists have participated in the program.

== Light Work Lab ==

The Lab offers members technical assistance through a digital lab with DIY printing and scanning equipment, a digital service lab, private studios, black-and-white darkrooms, a lighting studio, and a library.

It also runs workshops and classes covering darkroom and technical foundations of photography to digital workflow and practical professional development.

== Exhibitions ==

Since its inception Light Work has presented over 400 exhibitions. Four are curated annually in its Kathleen O. Ellis Gallery. Other venues include Light Work’s Hallway Gallery, the Community Darkrooms Gallery, and the Robert B. Menschel Photography Gallery. Light Work regularly collaborates with the Urban Video Project (UVP), the Everson Museum of Art, and other organizations and galleries in Syracuse. Satellite exhibitions are occasionally held at the Palitz Gallery at the Syracuse University Lubin House in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracusenewtimes.com/light-work-gallery-presents-aspen-mays/ Light Work gallery presents Aspen Mays | Syracuse New Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban Video Project ==

The Urban Video Project (UVP) is a multi-media public art initiative of Light Work and Syracuse University with technology provided by [[Time Warner Cable]]. Its mission is to present exhibitions and projects that celebrate the arts and culture of Syracuse, where UVP operates one permanent exhibition site and one mobile projection unit along the city's Connective Corridor. UVP Everson projects an image near the size of an IMAX screen above the sculpture plaza of the Everson Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectivecorridor.syr.edu/2014/01/16/urban-video-project-light-work-announce-january-and-february-2014-programming-for-uvp-everson-site/ Connective Corridor » Urban Video Project, Light Work announce January and February 2014 programming for UVP Everson site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323210944/http://connectivecorridor.syr.edu/2014/01/16/urban-video-project-light-work-announce-january-and-february-2014-programming-for-uvp-everson-site/ |date=2014-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==

The Light Work Collection holds over 3,500 photographs and art objects.

Artists-in-residence such as [[Cindy Sherman]], [[John Gossage]], Sunil Gupta, and others, are represented with early work that was made during the time of their Light Work residency.

== Publication ==

''Contact Sheet'' covers the latest work by emerging and mid-career artists from around the world. Its five issues each year are designed and printed in the tradition of fine art photography monographs and are advertisement-free. Many important photographers have been included in the early stages of their careers, including [[Andres Serrano]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Hank Willis Thomas]], and others.

==Background==
Rosalía began performing in [[tablao]]s a decade before the release of her recording debut, gradually becoming a known vocalist in [[Barcelona]]'s flamenco circuit. She worked as a [[guest artist]] and [[supporting act]] for various artists, including [[Chicuelo (guitarist)|Chicuelo]], [[Enric Palomar]], [[La Fura dels Baus]], [[Miguel Poveda]] and Rocío Márquez, performing across countries such as Germany, Singapur and Panama and events like the 2015 [[Primavera Sound]] and an [[Association of Performing Arts Professionals|APAP]] conference in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="elcultural"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elcultural.com/noticias/escenarios/Rosalia-y-Refree-al-flamenco-por-el-punk/10440|title=Rosalía y Refree, al flamenco por el punk|last=Yuste|first=Javier|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018|language=Spanish|work=El Cultural|publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millennial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://smoda.elpais.com/celebrities/vips/entrevista-rosalia-cantaora-millenial-barcelona/|title=Rosalía, la cantaora millenial que revoluciona el flamenco (y agota entradas)|date=October 19, 2016|accessdate=November 4, 2018|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|last=Ortega|first=Henar}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'': "I have done many collaborations with other musicians, and I have always tried that they were older than me, in order to learn from them."&lt;ref name="abuela"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/musica/abci-rosalia-interes-flamenco-nacio-viendo-cine-barrio-abuela-201702281345_noticia.html|title=Rosalía: «Mi primer contacto con el flamenco fue viendo Cine de Barrio con mi abuela»|last=Serrano|first=Nacho|language=Spanish|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalía grew up in a family with no artistic background that mostly listened to music in English.&lt;ref name="estopa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20180326/441968249949/rosalia-en-mi-casa-lo-mas-parecido-que-se-escuchaba-al-flamenco-era-estopa.html|title=Rosalía: "En mi casa lo más parecido que se escuchaba al flamenco era Estopa"|last=Herrero|first=Gabriel|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|language=Spanish|work=[[La Vanguardia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discovered flamenco at thirteen when her friends played [[Camarón de la Isla]] while meeting in a park after school, soon becoming fascinated with the genre and studying it on her own.&lt;ref name="woman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woman.es/celebrities/protagonistas/rosalia-primera-escuche-camaron-traspaso|title=Rosalía: "La primera vez que escuché a Camarón, me traspasó"|language=Spanish|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018|last=Tamarit|first=Olga|work=Woman Madame Figaro|publisher=Grupo Zeta}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she immersed herself in the Catalan flamenco scene, Rosalía met local fixture José Miguel Vizcaya "El Chiqui de la Línea", who suggested she started a degree in music.&lt;ref name="p4k"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/get-to-know-rosalia-the-spanish-singer-giving-flamencos-age-old-sound-a-bracingly-modern-twist/|title=Get to Know Rosalía, the Spanish Singer Giving Flamenco’s Age-Old Sound a Bracingly Modern Twist|date=September 18, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|publisher=[[Pitchfork]]|first=Philip|last=Sherburne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/42076/1/rosalia-el-mal-querer-interview|title=Rosalía is the Catalan star reshaping the sound of global pop|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|first=Gunseli|last=Yalcinkaya|publisher=[[Dazed Digital]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "El Chiqui" became Rosalía's teacher for the following eight years, as she studied Interpretation of Flamenco Singing at the [[Catalonia College of Music]] (Spanish: ''Escuela Superior de Música de Cataluña'', ESMUC).&lt;ref name="estopa"/&gt; The ESMUC only accepts one student of this discipline per year and Rosalía was selected in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revistavanityfair.es/cultura/entretenimiento/articulos/rosalia-malamante-pienso-tu-mira-el-mal-querer-refree-manager-canada/34353|title=Estos son los 10 nombre clave de la carrera de Rosalía|date=October 30, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|last=Serrano|first=Álex|language=Spanish|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair Spain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer has described "El Chiqui" as a fundamental figure in her career, who encouraged her to investigate the genre even further back in time. Speaking with ''ABC'', she stated: "To me, flamenco was Camarón, something of [[Romani people|gypsy]] aesthetics, and when going back I found many other things that I loved. [...] When I discovered ''[[cantaor]]es'' like Niño de la Huerta or "El Gloria", "El Chiqui" taught me to listen and appreciate their singing, because their recordings sound very bad! To people of our age that sound seems terrible to us."&lt;ref name="abuela"/&gt;

''Los ángeles'' is a [[concept album]] that collects a series of ''[[Palo (flamenco)|cantes]]'' which have [[death]] as its central theme.&lt;ref name="rtve"/&gt; It is a presentation of Rosalía as a soloist ''[[cantaora]]'' and as such its structure is similar to that of the debut of any orthodox flamenco singer: "a selection of varied ''[[Palo (flamenco)|palos]]'', often with traditional or popular lyrics, in which the artist shows his or her aptitude and background."&lt;ref name="jenesaispop"/&gt; In this manner, the singer encompasses several [[Musical form|forms]] of the genre, including ''[[alegrías]]'', ''[[Tango (flamenco)|tangos]]'', ''[[fandango]]s'', ''fandanguillos'', ''[[seguidillas]]'', ''[[tarantas]]'', ''[[malagueñas]]'' and "more specific" styles like ''[[Guajira (music)|guajira]]'', ''[[Saeta (flamenco)|saeta]]'' and ''milonga''.&lt;ref name="jenesaispop"/&gt; Rosalía felt that in the album "the ''cantes'' become songs", and as such did not list the ''palos''{{'s}} titles in the track listing, explaining that: "It's a way of saying that I am based on melodies and lyrics from ''cantes'', but we turn it into something else. Those who know something about flamenco will be able to identify them, because we are influenced by that, but we do our own thing."&lt;ref name="rtve"/&gt; 

Rosalía told Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo of [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] in 2018: "I feel like with ''Los ángeles'', I wanted to establish my musical legacy... and honor the classic sound of flamenco in the most traditional sense, respecting them to the maximum, with a pop and experimental structure, but with very basic instrumentation and a minimalist sound—just guitar and voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/rosalia-is-redefining-flamenco-1830164344|publisher=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018|title=Rosalía Is Redefining Flamenco|last=Caraballo|first=Ecleen Luzmila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Los ángeles'' received several positive reviews from [[music critics]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Spanish magazine ''[[Rockdelux]]'' called it "one of the most intense and sweeping debuts of recent times", with critic Juan Monge complimenting its mix of tradition and avant-garde.&lt;ref name="rockdelux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdelux.com/discos/p/rosalia-los-angeles.html|title=Rosalía. Los Ángeles|language=Spanish|last=Monge|first=Juan|date=April 2017|accessdate=July 25, 2018|work=[[Rockdelux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]]'s Mariano Prunes highly commended Rosalía's vocals, writing that "her instrument is a tornado capable of sweeping away any cultural or [[language barrier]]s", while noting that "she does not accomplish this with sheer volume or vocal histrionics, but by reaching almost unbearable levels of intensity and expression."&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; He concluded that ''Los ángeles'' "signals the appearance of a major talent in both the flamenco and the [[world music]] scene."&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Writing for MondoSonoro, Yeray S. Iborra felt that with ''Los ángeles'', Rosalía "is posited as the contemporary [[cantaor]]a who has better understood the current times", noting the difference between the album and her "more American" collaboration with C. Tangana.&lt;ref name="mondosonoro"/&gt;

===Flamenco specialists===
In an ''[[El Confidencial]]'' article, musician and investigator Pedro Lópeh criticized the album, particularly Refree's work, deeming it "artificial" and "wearisome". His views coincided with those of Silvia Cruz, another flamenco expert. He stated: "I also insist on talking about Refree because the inks are always loaded against her and little or nothing against him, who is the producer and first author of this album. I do not think ''Los ángeles'' does any harm to flamenco, but it is a decontextualized product. Apart from the lyrics, I do not hear anything in it that appeals to the history of flamenco, its roots or its referents. For that reason, it does not seem to me a groundbreaking or revolutionary work and if it has come to save something, it is the [[music industry]], not flamenco."&lt;ref name="antigitana"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2018-01-15/flamenco-rosalia-debate-cante-siglo-xxi_1504553/|language=Spanish|title=¿Rosalía antigitana?

He said: "Rosalía does not sing badly, but in flamenco she does not fit much. She is a very respectful girl, who has not come to invent a revolution for her face. She does not hurt anyone or has proclaimed herself master of anything." He was also critical of the album's promotional campaign, arguing that it installed the unworthy image of Rosalía as "the great revolution of flamenco".&lt;ref name="eldiario"/&gt;

==Accolades==

A challenge for museum architecture is the differing purposes of the building.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The museum collection must be preserved, but it also needs to be made accessible to the public. Climate control may be very important for the objects in the collection.

==History==
An early example of architecture for a purpose-built museum is the [[Museum of the History of Science]] building in [[Oxford]], [[England]], originally built to house the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

In the 20th century, museums have been combined with war memorials to serve multiple purposes. The [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]], for example, is a place of commemoration as well as for collection and display. It contains a museum, an archive and a shrine. It was designed by [[Emil Sodersten]] and [[John Crust]] in a contemporary [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style reminiscent of [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]] with detailing influenced by [[Art Deco]].

The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, USA (opened in 1959), by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is an important architectural landmark and icon of the 20th century. Another classic 20th century example of iconic museum architecture is the titanium-covered [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in Spain by [[Frank Gehry]] (opened in 1997). Gehry has undertaken many major museum architecture projects, including the [[Experience Music Project]] in Seattle, USA, the [[Weisman Art Museum]] in Minneapolis, USA, the [[Vitra Design Museum]] and [[MARTa Museum]] in Germany, and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, Canada.

Successful examples of modern architecture being married with existing museum buildings include the [[Louvre Pyramid]] by [[I. M. Pei]] in Paris, France (1989), and more recently the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] by [[Norman Foster]] at the [[British Museum]], London, England (2000).

[[David Chipperfield]] designed many notable museums, including the award-winning [[River and Rowing Museum]] in Henley-on-Thames, England, in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.architectural-review.com/home/ar-archive/ar-1997-january-david-chipperfields-river-and-rowing-museum/8611738.article | title=AR 1997 January — David Chipperfield's River and Rowing Museum | last=Richards | first=Ivor | journal=[[The Architectural Review]] | date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This won in 1999 the [[RIBA]] ''Architecture in Arts and Leisure Award'' and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] Trust/[[British Sky Broadcasting]] ''Best Building Award (England)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/74906CDF-4437-45C1-8470-4208CCD7901B/0/David_Chipperfield_CV.pdf | title=David Chipperfield | website=www.wakefield.gov.uk | publisher=[[Wakefield Council]] | location=UK | accessdate=October 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipperfield also designed the [[Figge Art Museum]] in Davenport, Iowa, USA (2005), the [[Museum of Modern Literature]] in Marbach, Germany (2006), and the reconstructed [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin, Germany (2009).

Museum architecture sometimes involves the [[Adaptive reuse|conversion]] of old buildings that have outlived their usefulness but that are still of historic interest. A notable example is the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] or the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] into the [[Tate Modern]] in 2000, based on design by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | title=Tate Modern | publisher=[[Carillion]] PLC | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130817/http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2483168510674278477 | title=Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern | publisher=[[Google Video]] | year=2008 | accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc]], an architecture firm based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, established in 1962, has undertaken museum architecture projects including [[Ellis Island|Ellis Island National Monument and Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/stli/serv02.htm STLI Service 2 Description], [[National Park Service]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; (Associated Architects with Beyer Blinder Belle Architects) and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (Associated Architects with Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners).

The '''Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act''' ('''NAGPRA'''), Pub. L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a [[United States federal law]] enacted on 16 November 1990.

The Act requires [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] and institutions that receive federal funding&lt;ref&gt;The [[Smithsonian Institution]] is exempt from this act, but rather must comply with similar requirements under the [[National Museum of American Indian act|National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; to return [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] "cultural items" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the [[repatriation]] process and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply.

NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding.

Lastly, NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense may reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.

==Background==
The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long-standing claims by [[federally recognized tribes]] for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from prehistoric, historic, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and [[indigenous rights]], prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items—human remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony—to proven lineal descendants, culturally related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups.

Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections' holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.&lt;ref name=CARRILLO&gt;Carrillo, Jo (1998). ''Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival'' Temple University Press, Philadelphia. {{ISBN|1-56639-582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal concerns===
Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary.
*State [[Statutory Law]]: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes.
*[[Common Law]]: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves.
*[[Equal Protection]]: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races.
*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the first amendment.
*[[Sovereignty]] Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.
*[[Treaty]]: From the beginning of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government in a treaty. The U.S.&amp;nbsp;government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty.

==Description==
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990.  The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"&gt;[[William C. Canby, Jr.|Canby&amp;nbsp;Jr., William&amp;nbsp;C.]] (2004). ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul: West,. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands.  The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to [[lineal descendants]].  If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"/&gt; Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood.  Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.

Congress attempted to "strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |title=Native American Graves Protection Act |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231023931/http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe.  This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nagpra/FAQ/INDEX.HTM Frequently Asked Questions - NAGPRA], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes.  Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; 

[[Image:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb | right | 350px | Map of [[Native American reservations]]]]
The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories.  Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that  activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities.  For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project.  For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation.  The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land.  The act allows [[archaeology|archaeological]] teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned.  Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).

A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American "cultural items." Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered "associated" if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. "Unassociated" funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by—or were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of—the agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated masscataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and [[Native Hawaiian]] organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of [[archaeology]] and [[physical anthropology]] in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that were felt to be constructive by all parties.

==History==

===Background===
The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history in regards to the loss of cultural artifacts and land.  With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of [[anthropology]] and [[archeology]] as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered  ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers.  As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century.  Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo, Jo, ed. ''Readings In American Indian Law.'' Temple University Press, 1998. Pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Pearson===
[[Maria Pearson]] is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" and the "[[Rosa Parks]] of NAGPRA".&lt;ref name="Still Running" /&gt; In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in [[Glenwood, Iowa]]. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor [[Robert D. Ray]], finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. "You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.

Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to [[Lobbying|lobby]] national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA.&lt;ref name="Still Running"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gradwohl|first=David M. |author2=Joe B.

===Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds===
The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the [[Slack Farm]] in [[Kentucky]], in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle over Athlete Jim Thorpe's burial site continues |newspaper=Washington Post |date=17 March 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/battle-over-athlete-jim-thorpes-burial-site-continues/2012/02/21/gIQAn5DLES_story_4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine'', March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, several protests at the [[Dickson Mounds]] site in [[Illinois]], where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neighbors Mourn Dickson Mounds` Demise |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 26, 1991 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-26/news/9104170045_1_native-americans-jim-edgar-archeologists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Return to the Earth'' project==
''Return to the Earth'' is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.return2theearth.org|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Religions for Peace|quote=Mission: The Return to the Earth project supports Native Americans in burying unidentifiable ancestral remains now scattered across the United States and enables a process of education and reconciliation between Native and Non-Native peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006.&lt;ref name='mcc'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Mennonite Central Committee]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061120234305/http://www.mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name='mcc'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm|title=Cheyenne Cultural Center|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=City of Clinton, Oklahoma |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407091455/http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial issues==
A few archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories.&lt;ref&gt;George Johnson, "Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists," ''New York Times'', 22 October 1996, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the [[Spirit Cave mummy]]; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nevadajournal.com/nj98/02/cover_story.htm|title=The Nevada Journal: Scalping Science: Sensitivity Run Amok|author=|date=|website=archive.nevadajournal.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennewick Man===
Compliance with the legislation can be complicated.  One example of controversy is that of  [[Kennewick Man]], a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near [[Kennewick, Washington]]. The federally recognized [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], [[Yakima Tribe|Yakima]], and [[Nez Perce tribe]]s had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him.  Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla.

Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable.&lt;ref name="Custred_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Custred, Glynn|title=The Forbidden Discovery of Kennewick Man|journal=Academic Questions|volume=13|issue=3|year=2000|pages=12–30|doi=10.1007/s12129-000-1034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains.&lt;ref&gt;McManamon, F.&amp;nbsp;P. [http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/ Kennewick Man.] ''National Park Service Archeology Program.'' May 2004 (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains.

One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is "more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population." In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area.&lt;ref name="SR2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2017 |title=Tribes lay remains of Kennewick Man to rest |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/20/tribes-lay-remains-of-kennewick-man-to-rest/ |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==
[[File:Distinctive marking of cultural property in Austria-from Flickr 141273020.jpg|thumb|right|Distinctive Marking of Cultural Property, [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]]]]

The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with [[El&amp;nbsp;Salvador]] in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with [[Canada]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Mali]] and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It is not an easy business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Phyllis Mauch. ''The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property Whose Culture? Whose Property?'' New York: University of New Mexico, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970525145320/http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |archivedate=May 25, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures.

[[File:Minik in New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minik Wallace]] ([[Kalaallit]]) in New York, 1897]]
On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant [[Robert Peary]] brought six [[Inuit]] people from [[Greenland]] to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, at the request of the [[anthropologist]] Franz Boas, in order to "obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance" regarding Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David H. ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity,'' p.78. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;  About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit people became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. These people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] with [[tuberculosis]], which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died and shortly after that two more followed. By the time the sickness had run its course, two men survived.  ''[[Minik Wallace|Minik]]'' was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while ''Uissakassak'' returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father's skeleton on display in the museum.

In 1993 the museum finally agreed to [[Minik Wallace#Inuit burial|return the four Inuit skeletons]] to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"&gt;[[David Hurst Thomas|Thomas, David&amp;nbsp;H.]] ''Skull Wars,'' pp. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hurst Thomas]]' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"/&gt;

===Protecting cultural property===
In the United States, the [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act]] (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites to conserve associated the cultural property.

Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains:

*Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade.  Countries that use these laws include Canada, [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].
*Total [[export restriction]] laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property.  Many [[Latin America]]n and Mediterranean countries use these laws.
*Other countries, such as [[Mexico]], use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

The '''Oakland Asian Cultural Center''', also referred to as the '''OACC''', is an Oakland-based nonprofit cultural center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Good Music, Talk in Oakland|url = http://blog.sfgate.com/wwong/2009/10/14/good-music-talk-in-oakland/|website = City Brights: William Wong|accessdate = 2015-11-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that carries out Asian and [[Pacific Islander]] American arts and culture programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Northern California Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|last = Williams|first = Mark|publisher = Globe Pequot|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the Pacific Renaissance Plaza in [[Chinatown, Oakland|Oakland Chinatown]], residing three blocks away from the 12th Street Civic Center BART station on Broadway.

In the early 1980s, a community coalition asked for a space for a pan-Asian Cultural Center and the Asian Library, expressing a desire for an artistic and cultural space in the Chinatown area of Oakland. Historian Eve Ma notes that the ''Oakland Asian Cultural Center'' started in December 1984 as the East Bay Chinese Culture Center. In 1987, as it began acquiring help from the city government and recognizing that Chinatown's composition had changed, the Center changed its name, broadening its aim to include all Asian cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Politics and Institutionalization of Panethnic Identity|last = Kwon|first = Soo Ah|date = June 2013|journal = Journal of Asian American Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since opening its own facility in 1996 Oakland’s Chinatown district, the OACC has offered cultural programs including performances, workshops, festivals, school tours, classes, and exhibitions.

== Services ==
The OACC has educational programming and cultural activities for residents of Oakland Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saving Chinatown|url = http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/saving-chinatown/Content?oid=4554270|website = East Bay Express|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups and artists hold weekly classes in dance, martial arts, art, history, and language at the center. The activities offered at the center range from traditions that span across the world, including [[Ikebana|Japanese flower arrangement]], [[Buddhist meditation|Theravada Buddhist meditation]], [[Gong Fu|Chinese Gong Fu]] and Mongolian traditional dance.

The space has an auditorium with a stage, conference rooms, dance studio, lobby, and kitchen that serve as ongoing and one-time resources for local nonprofit organizations, schools, government agencies, [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]], and individuals. The auditorium is named after Edward W. Chin. Chin donated $250,000 towards the completion of the center's auditorium, a space that is used for major events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asia America|last = Wong|first = William|publisher = Temple University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiger calf Musei Capitolini MC1222.jpg|thumb|Tigress attacking a calf, marble ''opus sectile''  (325–350 AD) from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] on the [[Esquiline Hill]], Rome]]

'''''Opus sectile''''' is an art technique popularized in the ancient and medieval [[Roman world]] where materials were cut and [[inlay|inlaid]] into walls and floors to make a picture or pattern. Common materials were [[marble]], [[nacre|mother of pearl]], and [[glass]]. The materials were cut in thin pieces, polished, then trimmed further according to a chosen pattern. Unlike [[opus tessellatum|tessellated mosaic]] techniques, where the placement of very small uniformly sized pieces forms a picture, ''opus sectile'' pieces are much larger and can be shaped to define large parts of the design.

==Origin==
[[File:Pannelli di giunio basso 03.1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biga (chariot)|Two-horse chariot]] bearing the presiding [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] at a ''[[pompa circensis]]'' ("[[ludi circenses|circus]] parade"), from the Basilica of Junius Bassus&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, "The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 86.1 (1982), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although early examples have been found from [[Egypt]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the most prominent artifacts remain from 4th century Rome. A large set from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] survived, depicting an elaborate [[chariot]] and other things. The popularity of ''opus sectile'' decoration continued in Rome through the 6th century, and affected areas as far as [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]] in Turkey).  Particularly remarkable are a series of ''opus sectile'' glass panels, found in a possible sanctuary of Isis at the eastern Corinthian port of Kenchreai, in excavations carried out in the 1960s; they have scenes of famous authors like Homer and Plato, scenes of [[Nilotic landscape]]s, harbour-front cities and geometric panels. Recent work in Jerusalem has recovered enough pieces of floor tile from the Herodian Temple Mount to reconstruct geometric patterns of ''opus sectile'' flooring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/what-the-temple-mount-floor-looked-like/?mqsc=E3854622 Frankie Snyder, Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira. 2016. ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', November/December.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later uses==
[[File:Ca' d'oro, cortile 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Cosmatesque pavement, [[Ca' d'Oro]], Venice]]
Although the technique died in Rome with the decline of the Empire, it continued to be used prominently in [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] churches, primarily in floor designs. From Byzantium it was eventually brought back to [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland, in the 12th century as the [[Cosmatesque]] style, concentrating on geometric patterns.  There was a major revival from the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the form of [[pietra dura]] work, although this normally consists of much smaller compositions and it is used on furniture, mainly.  Architectural work from later periods tends to be called [[Intarsia]].

In England, the technique was revived in the late 19th century by artists working in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Charles Hardgrave, whose designs were executed by [[James Powell &amp; Sons]] at the Whitefriars Glass Works, was a noted designer in this technique.

'''Otis College of Art and Design''' is a private art school and design school in the [[Westchester, Los Angeles|Westchester]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California. Established in 1918, it was the city's first independent professional school of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aicad.org/schools/otis-college-of-art-and-design/|work=Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design|title=Otis College of Art and Design|archive-url=http://archive.is/xKIxZ|archive-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main campus is located in the former [[IBM|IBM Aerospace]] Headquarters at 9045 [[Lincoln Boulevard (Southern California)|Lincoln Boulevard]] in Westchester, Los Angeles.

The school's programs, accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges|WASC]] and [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]], include four-year BFA degrees in [[illustration]], [[fine art]]s, [[graphic design]], [[architecture]], [[landscape design]], [[interior design]], [[fashion design]], [[digital media]], [[toy|toy design]], and [[product design]]. It also offers MFA degrees in [[fine arts]], [[graphic design]], public practice, and [[writing]]. 

Undergraduate students choose a major in their second year, after completing a battery of traditional drawing, painting, composition, and construction classes in their first or "Foundation" year. In addition to studio work, standard [[liberal arts]] courses are required, although traditional history courses are replaced by [[art history]].

== History ==
[[File:Otiscollege.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The Ahmanson building at Otis College of Art and Design]]
Otis, long considered one of the major art institutions in California, began in 1918, when ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' founder [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] bequeathed his [[Westlake, Los Angeles]], property to start the first public, independent professional school of art in Southern California. The current Otis College main campus (since Spring 1997) is located in the Westchester area of Los Angeles, close to the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. The main building (built in 1963) was designed by architect [[Eliot Noyes]] for IBM and is famous for its computer "[[punched card]]" style windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The IBM Punched Card |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/punchcard/impacts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was extensively remodeled in 1997 by the college when it moved from its original location across the street from [[MacArthur Park]] near downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Otis College of Art and Design Timeline/History |url=http://www.otis.edu/history-timeline|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galef Center, made for the Fine Arts department, was designed by Fredrick Fisher and built in 2001.

A [[ceramic art|ceramics]] school was begun by [[Peter Voulkos]] at Otis in the 1950s and was part of art movements like the Craft-to-Art movement, also known as the [[American Clay Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PETER VOULKOS |work=ArtScene |accessdate=2012-08-05 |url=http://artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles1996/Articles0296/Voulkos.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which influenced the [[Ferus Gallery]] scene of the 1960s. Many prominent artists associated with Southern California’s Light and Space movement were involved with the school, as well as leaders of the conceptual art world of the 1970s. Moreover, Otis nurtured significant Latino artists, and the mural group [[Los Four]] also originated at Otis in the 1970s.

The school was originally named Otis Art Institute. From 1978 until 1991, it was affiliated with New York's [[Parsons School of Design]] and known as Otis-Parsons (full name: Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, A Division of the New School for Social Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/17/archives/parsons-and-otis-art-school-merger.html|title=Parsons and Otis: Art School Merger|date=May 17, 1979|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affiliation allowed students to spend a semester or more at the Parsons schools in New York and Paris. In 1991, it became independent and known as Otis College of Art and Design.

Today it is one of the most culturally diverse private schools of art and design in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalouver.com/resource/otis/otis.pdf|title=OTIS: NINE DECADES OF LOS ANGELES ART EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHT LASTING IMPACT OF LA ARTISTS &amp; MOVEMENTS|location=Los Angeles, CA|date=  October 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Crossdressing}}
A '''pantomime dame''' is a traditional role in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pantomime]]. It is a continuation of ''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' portrayal of female characters by male actors in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. They are often played either in an extremely [[Camp (style)|camp]] style, or else by men acting '[[Butch and femme|butch]]' in women's clothing. They wear big make up and [[big hair]], have exaggerated physical features, and perform in a [[melodramatic]] style. While not from pantomime, possibly the best known of this type of character is [[Dame Edna Everage]] whose name plays on two meanings of ''dame'': this tradition and the title equivalent to ''[[Sir]]''.

==Dame characters==
Characters who are played as pantomime dames are often - though not exclusively - older, matronly women. Indeed, they may be the protagonist's mother, as in ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', or a [[nursemaid]] to the protagonist, as in ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]''. Although often warm and sympathetic characters, dames may also be employed as comic antagonists, such as with the [[Ugly sisters|Ugly Sisters]] in ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantomime Dames|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/pantodames.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pantomimes traditionally do not contain standard dame roles, but certain productions may add a dame character, as in the case with many pantomime versions of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Pan|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/storypeterpan.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of these characters include:
*[[Widow Twankey]], the traditional name for [[Aladdin|Aladdin's]] mother in the pantomime versions of the story
*[[Mother Goose]]
*The nanny or nurse in ''[[Babes in the Woods]]'' 
*The cook in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''
*The queen in ''[[Puss in Boots]]''
*Goldilocks' mother in ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', who runs a circus in many versions of the pantomime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldilocks and the Three Bears|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/storygoldilocks.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French '''perchman''' is equivalent to the U.S. [[boom operator (media)|boom operator]] in film production, also called the sound assistant or boomer, but differs regarding attributions. The perchman is the [[production sound mixer]]'s assistant and is in charge of the [[microphone]] placement, typically using a light and telescopic pole also called a fish pole or boom. &lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/boom-operator getinmedia.com, Boom operator] &lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the perchman places and moves the microphone "in real time" in order to pick up the voices of each [[actor]] during filming. Being a perchman involves providing the best sound quality possible to the sound mixer while at the same time, not causing shadows or entering the camera frame. To accomplish this, the perchman works in collaboration with the [[camera operator]] and the [[cinematographer]] (who directs the camera movements and lights the scenes) and the [[gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]]. Other duties include the hiding of miniature [[wireless microphones]] (radio mics) on the actors, the placement of hidden auxiliary microphones, and the controlling of sound reflections by the use of furniture blankets and carpet. He readies the equipment at the beginning of each day and stores the gear when the day is "wrapped", or finished. The perchman manages the technical contingencies allowing the production sound mixer to concentrate on the artistic side of sound recording.

A '''public bookcase''' is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with [[Library|libraries]]. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.

== Origin ==
Closely allied with the [[BookCrossing]] concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html ''Book Crossing: Offene Bücherschränke in Bonn'', reticon-Report von Martin Ragg, 2. April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103044019/http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg &amp; Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as "free open-air libraries" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ ''Die Geschichte der Offenen Bibliotheken'' auf hannover.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819054002/http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bonn]] Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea "outdoor books&amp;nbsp;– books in the open" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-bonn.de/cms/download/pressetexte/pressemeldung_031115.pdf ''Bürgerstiftung Bonn stellt offenen Bücherschrank auf'', Presseerklärung der Bürgerstiftung Bonn, 15. November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and since this time the concept has been widely replicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_0806/nachricht3102.html ''Bücherwald&amp;nbsp;– erstes öffentliches Bücherregal im Berliner Straßenraum'', Presseerklärung Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 27. Juni 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=offener Bücherschrank – Wien
 |url = http://www.offener-buecherschrank.at/ |date=2010 |access-date=8 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.öffentliche-bücherregale.ch/ Öffentliche Bücherregale]&lt;/ref&gt; a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 Medienmitteilung der [[Christoph Merian Stiftung]] vom 14. Juni 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108234709/http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://3landinfo.blogspot.com/2011/06/dies-das-ein-neuer-bucherschrank.html 3land.info: ''dies &amp; das &amp; ein neuer Bücherschrank'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Open bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-juelicht.de/nachrichten/artikel/10465.php Das JüLichT: ''Jülich ganz „sozial“''] Beitrag 2. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.

== Use and acceptance ==
If a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by "bookcase sponsors" or "godfathers" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.

The acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huk.uni-bonn.de/pdf-dateien/bonner-buecherschrank-artikel''Der Bonner Bücherschrank auf der PoppelsdorferAllee – Ein merkwürdiges Versorgungssystem . Kurzfassung der Ergebnisse des Projekts „Das Nutzungsverhalten am Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank“''] (pdf) Autoren: Prof. Dr. Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, Sandra Bichler, Kerstin Hilt, Olga Reger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/publikationen/forsch/forsch-2-april-2009/lernen_und_lehren.pdf''Bonner "Gemeinschaftsmöbel" Studienobjekt: Offener Bücherschrank als soziales System'' (pdf) Autorin: Ulrike Klopp. In: forsch / Bonner Universitäts-Nachrichten 2/2009. (S.27)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 ''Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank: Die Frauen geben, die Männer nehmen''; Bonner General-Anzeiger, 3. February 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825024252/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 |date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 ''Ein Schrank für ausgesetzte Bücher/Bürgerstiftung Bonn eröffnet in den kommenden Tagen zwei weitere Freiluft-Bibliotheken'', Bonner General-Anzeiger, 20. November 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823113855/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 |date=2011-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
In Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called "book exchange", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.

The Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.

A cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.

== Catalogs and mapping ==
[[File:Pizza Hut themed Little Free Library in Gillette, Wyoming.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A [[Pizza Hut]] themed Little Free Library in [[Gillette, Wyoming]]]]

In the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the [[Little Free Library]] network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the [[Open Book Case]] project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project [[OpenStreetMap]] has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">'''Society of Independent Artists''' was an association of American artists founded in 1916 and based in [[New York City|New York]].

==Background==
Based on the French [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]], the goal of the society was to hold annual exhibitions by [[avant-garde]] artists. Exhibitions were to be open to anyone who wanted to display their work, and shows were without juries or prizes. In order to enter, one had to pay a six-dollar membership and entry fee. Founders of the Society were [[Walter Arensberg]], [[John Covert (painter)|John Covert]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Katherine Sophie Dreier]], [[William J. Glackens]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[John Marin]], [[Walter Pach]], [[Man Ray]], [[Mary Rogers (artist)]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and [[Joseph Stella]]. 

The "First Annual Exhibition" of the society at the Grand Central Palace, New York, April 10-May 6, 1917, included more than 2,000 art works, which the catalog indicates were hung in alphabetical order by the artist's last name. Although there were entries from all over the world, they were predominantly by artists of New York and other East Coast cities.&lt;ref&gt; [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueannual00yorkgoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''Catalogue of the First Annual Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists''] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Duchamp]] resigned as a director after the Society refused to include in the exhibition the ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' &amp;mdash; a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] in the form of a urinal and signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt." The incident pointed out that the exhibition was not truly ''open''. 

Following the first president, [[William Glackens]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] was president from 1918 until his death in 1951. From 1918 to 1934 [[A.S. Baylinson]] served as secretary.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=2005 | title=Finding Aid | work=A Finding Aid to the A. S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11369">'''Sound poetry''' is an artistic form bridging literary and [[musical composition]], in which the [[phonetic]] aspects of [[human speech]] are foregrounded instead of more conventional [[semantic]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] values; "verse without words". By definition, sound poetry is intended primarily for [[performance poetry|performance]].

==History and development==

===The vanguards of the 20th century===
While it is sometimes argued that the roots of sound poetry are to be found in [[oral poetry]] traditions, the writing of pure sound texts that downplay the roles of meaning and structure is a 20th-century phenomenon. The [[Futurist]] and [[Dadaist]] Vanguards of the beginning of this century were the pioneers in creating the first sound poetry forms. [[Marinetti|Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] discovered that onomatopoeias were useful to describe a battle in Tripoli where he was a soldier, creating a sound text that became a sort of a spoken photograph of the battle. Dadaists were more involved in sound poetry and they invented different categories:
*''Bruitist poem'' it is the phonetic poem, not so different from the futurist poem. Invented by [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].
*''Simultaneous poem'' a poem read in different languages, with different rhythms, tonalities, and by different persons at the same time. Invented by [[Tristan Tzara]].
*''Movement poem'' is the poem accompanied by primitive movements.

===Later developments===
Sound poetry evolved into [[visual poetry]] and [[concrete poetry]], two forms based in visual arts issues although the sound images are always very compelling in them. Later on, with the development of the magnetic [[tape recorder]], sound poetry evolved thanks to the upcoming of the [[concrete music]] movement at the end of the 1940s. Some sound poetics were used by later poetry movements like the [[beat generation]] in the fifties or the [[spoken word]] movement in the 80's, and by other art and music movements that brought up new forms such as [[text sound art]] that may be used for sound poems which more closely resemble "fiction or even essays, as traditionally defined, than poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/kostelanetz.html|title=U B U W E B :: Text Sound Art : A Survey|website=www.ubu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early examples===

''Das Große Lalulá'' (1905) by [[Christian Morgenstern]], in the collection ''[[Galgenlieder]]''.

''[[Zang Tumb Tumb]]'' (1914) is a sound poem and concrete poem by Italian futurist [[F. T. Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Yld7wGWEI|title=Zang Tumb Tumb   Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|first=|last=Mizar4590|date=2 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Ball]] performed [[I Zimbra|a piece]] of sound poetry in a reading at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in 1916:
:"I created a new species of verse, 'verse without words,' or sound poems....I recited the following:
:::gadji beri bimba
:::glandridi lauli lonni cadori..."
::::(Albright, 2004)

[[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate'' (1922–32, "Primal Sonata") is a particularly well known early example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7E2i0KMqM|title=Kurt Schwitters - Ursonate  (1932)|first=|last=Laurent Cournoyer|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first movement [[rondo]]'s principal [[theme (music)|theme]] being a word, "fmsbwtözäu" pronounced ''Fümms bö wö tää zää Uu'', from a 1918 poem by [[Raoul Hausmann]], apparently also a sound poem. Schwitters also wrote a less well-known sound poem consisting of the sound of the letter W. (Albright, 2004)

Chilean Vicente Huidobro's explores phonetic mutations of words in his book "Altazor" (1931).

In his story ''The Poet at Home'', [[William Saroyan]] refers to a character who practices a form of pure poetry, composing verse of her own made-up words.

==Female practitioners==

It has been argued that "there is a paucity of information on women's involvement in sound poetry, whether as practitioners, theorists, or even simply as listeners".&lt;ref&gt;[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]] and Suzanne Zelazo, "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modernism-modernity/v018/18.2.gammel.html Harpsichords Metallic Howl—": The Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's Sound Poetry]." Modernism/modernity (Johns Hopkins UP), 18.2 (April 2011), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest female practitioners are Berlin poet [[Else Lasker-Schüler]], who experimented in what she called "Ursprache" (Ur-language), and the New York Dada poet and performer [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. The Baroness’s poem "Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)" was published in ''The Little Review'' in March 1920 to great controversy. Written in response to her husband Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven’s suicide, the sound poem was "a mourning song in nonsense sounds that transcended national boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroness was also known for her sexually charged sound poetry, as seen in "Teke Heart (Beating of Heart)", only recently published.&lt;ref&gt;Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa von. ''Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven''. Ed. Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011. 184-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe has produced at least 2 accomplished sound poets in the persons of Greta Monach (Netherlands) &amp; Katlin Ladik (Hungary), who released an EP of her work, "Phonopoetica", in 1976. In England, Paula Claire has been working with improvisational sound since the 1960s.

The United States has produced at least one accomplished sound poet, [[Tracie Morris]], from Brooklyn, New York. She began presenting sound poetry in the mid-1990s. Her live and installation sound poetry has been featured in numerous venues including the Whitney Biennial in 2002.

==Other examples of sound poets==

Later prominent sound poets include [[Henri Chopin]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Ada Verdun Howell]], [[bpNichol]], Bill Bissett, [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Giovanni Fontana (poet)|Giovanni Fontana]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Giovanni Fontana (poeta)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Heidsieck]], [[Enzo Minarelli]], [[François Dufrene]], [[Mathias Goeritz]], [[Maurizio Nannucci]], [[Andras Petocz]], [[Joan La Barbara]], Paul Dutton, multidisciplinary artists [[Jeremy Adler]], [[Jean-Jacques Lebel]], [[John Giorno]], Henrik Aeshna, a Paris-based poet, artist and performer who experiments with [[Noise]], [[shamanism]] and [[visual poetry]], New York City jazz poet Steve Dalachinsky, [[Yoko Ono]], [[Young Thug]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wired.com/2015/10/young-thug-evolution-of-language Young Thug Isn't Rapping Gibberish, He's Evolving Language]". [[Wired magazine]]. Retrieved 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaap Blonk]], a Dutch sound poet who often works with improvising musicians.

The poet [[Edith Sitwell]] coined the term '''''abstract poetry''''' to describe some of her own poems which possessed more aural than literary qualities, rendering them essentially meaningless: "The poems in ''Façade'' are ''abstract'' poems—that is, they are patterns of sound. They are...virtuoso exercises in technique of extreme difficulty, in the same sense as that in which certain studies by Liszt are studies in transcendental technique in music." (Sitwell, 1949)

An early Dutch artist, Theo van Doesburg, was another prominent sound poet in the early 1900s.

==Theories==

In their essay "Harpsichords Metallic Howl—", Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo review the theories of sound by [[Charles Bernstein]], Gerald Bruns, Min-Quian Ma, [[Rachel Blau DuPlessis]], Jeffrey McCaffery and others to argue that sonic poetry foregrounds its own corporality. Thus "the Baroness's sound poems let her body speak[;] through her expansive use of sound, the Baroness conveys the fluidity of gender as a constantly changing, polysemous signifier." In this way, somatic art becomes the poet's own "space-sound."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gammel and Zelazo, "Harpsichords Metallic Howl." 259, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, for many dadaists, such as Hugo Ball, sound poetry also presented a language of trauma, a cacophony used to protest the sound of the cannons of World War I. It was as T. J. Demos writes, "a telling stutter, a nervous echolalia."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gammel and Zelazo, "Harpsichords Metallic Howl." 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''station point''' is a [[location (geography)|location]] or vantage point from which an [[artist]] or exhibitor intends an [[observation|observer]] to experience an [[art]]work.

In [[photography]], the station point is the location of the [[camera]] at the point in time when the camera [[Video|records]] a [[Perspective (visual)|view]] to a [[recording medium]].

In traditional [[graphical perspective]], '''oculus''' (abbreviated ''O'') denotes the point&lt;ref&gt;[[Kirsti Andersen]] (2007) ''Geometry of an Art'', p. xxix, Springer, {{ISBN|0-387-25961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[space]] where a viewer sees a scene to be portrayed on a [[picture plane]]. When depiction of a scene is taken over by a camera with [[photography]], the "eye point" or oculus becomes the station point.

==Early life and education==
Sue Williams was born in 1956 in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artesmundi.org/artists/sue-williams "Sue Williams"], Artes Mundi, Retrieved 23 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams studied art in [[Cardiff]] in the 1970s, later getting her [[Master of Arts]] from [[Cardiff College of Art]] (UWIC).&lt;ref name="BBCWales" /&gt;

==Work==
Williams made the news in 2009 when she was awarded £20,000 from [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funds (via the [[Arts Council of Wales]]) to finance a study of cultural attitudes towards women’s bottoms.&lt;ref name="Mirror bottoms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox bottoms" /&gt; She explained to the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' that the money would cover living costs while she built up a new collection of three dimensional work, which would partly consist of plaster casts of all parts of women's bodies. "My present work stems from a desire to visually explore and understand issues related to the feminine ideal - the desire to change body shape, the pressure to create perfection and to compromise a personal identity" she said.&lt;ref name="WM buttock moulding" /&gt; Williams had been inspired by a visit to [[Zimbabwe]], where her work had been taken down from two galleries because it portrayed women's backsides.&lt;ref name="WM buttock moulding" /&gt;

In 2009 Williams visited China to study their gender politics and the dynamics of communication between men and women. She was invited back again in 2013 to take part in a touring exhibition called ''Open Books''. The exhibition subsequently toured to Australia.&lt;ref name="CCQ Open Mind" /&gt;

Her work is represented in the collection of the [[University of South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oriel y Bont: Museum Collection |work=|publisher=University of South Wales |url=http://gallery.southwales.ac.uk/oriel-y-bont-collection/ |format= |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently a lecturer in fine art at [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] in [[Swansea]].&lt;ref name="CCQ Open Mind" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2000 Williams was the recipient of the [[Welsh National Eisteddfod]] Gold Medal for Fine Art&lt;ref name="Gold Medal" /&gt; and the Rootstein Hopkins Foundation Award for painting.&lt;ref name="BBCWales" /&gt; In 2005 she was one of eight shortlisted artists (the only British representative) for the second biannual [[Artes Mundi|Artes Mundi Prize]].&lt;ref name="AM shortlist" /&gt;

'''''The Supper at Emmaus''''' is a painting  by the Italian [[Baroque]] master [[Caravaggio]], executed in 1601, and now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in [[London]]. Originally this painting was commissioned and paid for by Ciriaco Mattei, brother of cardinal Girolamo Mattei.

The painting depicts the moment when the resurrected but incognito [[Jesus]], reveals himself to two of his disciples (presumed to be [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[Cleopas]]) in the town of [[Emmaus]], only to soon vanish from their sight ([[Gospel of Luke]] 24: 30–31). Cleopas wears the [[Scallop#Symbolism of the shell|scallop shell]] of a [[pilgrim]]. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background. The table lays out a still-life meal. Like the world these apostles knew, the basket of food teeters perilously over the edge.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

[[File:CaravaggioEmmaus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|''[[Supper at Emmaus (Milan) (Caravaggio)|Supper at Emmaus (Milan)]]'', 1606. [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera]], [[Milan]].]]
In the [[Gospel of Mark]] (16:12) Jesus is said to have appeared to them "in another form", which may be why he is depicted beardless here, as opposed to the bearded Christ in ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of St Matthew]]'', where a group of seated money counters is interrupted by the recruiting Christ. It is also a recurring theme in Caravaggio's paintings to find the sublime interrupting the daily routine. The unexalted humanity is apt for this scene, since the human Jesus has made himself unrecognizable to his disciples, and at once confirms and surmounts his humanity. Caravaggio seems to suggest that perhaps a Jesus could enter our daily encounters. The dark background envelops the tableau.

Caravaggio painted another version of the ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Milan) (Caravaggio)|Supper at Emmaus]]'' (now in the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera]], [[Milan]]) in 1606. By comparison, the gestures of figures are far more restrained, making presence more important than performance. This difference possibly reflects the circumstances of Caravaggio's life at that point (he had fled Rome as an outlaw following the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni), or possibly, recognising the ongoing evolution of his art, in the intervening five years he had come to recognise the value of understatement.

==Kinds of theatre==
*Telugu theatre is having its roots from almost 2nd century BC. the theatre of Telugu can be deveded into various kinds. the major kinds are Folk theatre, Padya Natakam, Parishath natakam, Gadyanatakam or social plays, the prayoga natakam or experimental plays and the Street theatre.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andhranatakam.com/Artists.html |title=AndhraNatakam Artists |publisher=Andhranatakam.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Folk Theatre .. Telugu people who lives in both the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh having very rich folk Theatrical Traditions. Chindu Bhagavatham or Chindu yakshaganahese kind of forms. research scholars like Dr. Bhikshu and others proved that there somany theatrical elements in these forms. 
Chindu bhagavatam or yakshaganam : this is eminent Folk theatre form of Telangana state. there were thousands of scripts written for the performance of chindu. there are two major traditions in chindu Yakshaganam. one is traditional art for the sake of the cast related rituals. and the other one is occasional performances for entertainment. This tradition is being performed by chindu madigas who are dependent cast people of madiga community. chindu madigas plays the cast myths Adi jambapuranam and yellamma katha for the rituals of their cast. for entertainment they play myths folk tales and histarical subjects. chervirala Bhagayya was one of the prominent writer who wrote more than 100 yakshaganas. chindu yellamma gaddam narendar gaddam srinivas shindu shyam aresome of the prominent performers of the chindu yakshaganam.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eenadu1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu1"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Padya Natakam==
As it is started from the Padya Natakam, The people of Telugu Theatre used to render the poems for a long time. Plays like 'Satya Harischandra', 'Kurukshetram', 'Gayopaakyanam' are the well known plays. poems like "chelliyo chellako". " Bava eppudu vachiteevo" are used to render by the every common man in every part of the village. The actors used to sing these many more times.

The interesting feature in Telugu theatre is the main roles are cast by two persons and named as "okatava (first)" "rendo (the second)", for example okatava krishnudu (first krishna), rendava krishnudu (second krishna). Most of the performances start at late nights and will continue till early mornings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

==Parishat Natakam==
Parishat is a traditional Theatre event conducted annually at different places in Andhra Pradesh. It spans about three to four days having a competition of plays for the Parishatnatakam groups spread across the state. The present baseline study reveals that fifty one Parishats were conducted in Andhra Pradesh during the year 2011 and out of them, 41 Parishats have been conducted in coastal region of Andhra Pradesh. Though only 10 Parishats are situated in the other parts of Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

==Gadya Natakam==
After staging the play vyvahara Dharma Bhodhini of veereselingam in 1890, the scenario of Telugu theatre has changed. Most of the writers have been started writings on the socio economical problems raised in the society. They have also written political satires. The comedy play like 'Chintamani" is an all-time favorite of Andhra people.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The other most important feature in the Telugu theatre is "Parishid Play". These Parishid plays have taken place for the improvements in Telugu theatre and lead to a realistic movement rather than the normal epic stories happened before that time. The parishid also established a realistic movement of Telugu theatre. As against the existing tradition of musical plays i.e. padya natakam, it pleaded for socially relevant theatre. To achieve this, it held annual competitions regarded as a touch stone of artistic excellence, insisting that only social or one-act drama within the previous five years was eligible to participate and that women should enact female roles. The time factor of 1hr is also another important factor in these parishid plays.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

==Prayoga Natakam or Experimental Drama==
This is a differient kind of plays written and performed by various plays. major place for these kind is educational institutes like universities and the colleges where the theatre is a part of their education.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

'''''The Beggars''''' or '''''The Cripples''''' is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1568. It is now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

==History==
This work is the only painting by Bruegel in the Louvre, received as a gift in 1892.

Attempts have been made to interpret the picture of five cripples and a beggar-woman as an allusion to a historical event: the badger's tails, or foxes' tails, on their clothes might refer to the [[Les Gueux|Gueux]], a rebel party formed against the government of [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Granvelle]]; but these also occur in Bruegel's ''[[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]]'' in [[Vienna]], dated 1559. Still, the beggars are not quite ordinary beggars, as they wear carnival headgear representing various classes of society: a cardboard crown (the king), a paper [[shako]] (the soldier), a beret (the bourgeois), a cap (the peasant), and a [[mitre]] (the bishop). The work clearly has some satirical meaning, which has so far eluded interpretation. Perhaps physical imperfections are meant to symbolise moral decrepitude, which can affect all men irrespective of class.&lt;ref&gt;V. Barker, ''Pieter Bruegel the elder: A study of his paintings'', Arts Publishing Corp. (1926); see also W. S. Gibson, ''Bruegel'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the painting are two inscriptions which seem to date from the 16th century. One is in [[Flemish language|Flemish]], and in a very fragmentary state;&lt;ref&gt;Reconstructed by the Louvre as "Cripples, take heart, and may your affairs prosper.", cf. [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/beggars Louvre webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; the other is in [[Latin language|Latin]] and records the admiration some humanist felt for Bruegel, ''whose art surpasses Nature itself''.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Marijnissen, ''Bruegel, tout l'oeuvre peint et dessiné'', Éditions Albin Michel (1988), pp. 354-358 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting dates from the end of Bruegel's career, when he showed a keener interest in the natural world. Tiny though it is, the landscape seen through the opening is bathed in a delicate light which simmers like dew on the foliage.

==Description==

{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}

On the back of the painting is written:{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=61}}

&lt;poem&gt;
What nature lacks, is lacking in our art,
So great was the grace accorded to our painter.
Here nature, expressed in painted forms, is astonished
To see through these cripples that Bruegel is her equal.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Analysis==

{{Expand section|date=February 2015}}

Modern eyes may be inclined to conclude that Brugel intended to invoke sympathy for the plight of the crippled figures, but from a historical perspective this is unlikely.  Europeans of Bruegel's time gave little regard to beggars, and the painting provides hints that Bruegel shared this denigration: the figures are outside the town walls and are posed in such ways as to provoke contempt and amusement.  The [[Foxtail (diaspore)|foxtail]] on some of the figures was a symbol at the time of ridicule in political caricature and real life.  The woman behind them bears an empty bowl and may appear to be ignoring the beggars.{{sfn|Bonn|2006|p=111}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3810">'''The Conceptual Framework'''   a linked set of agencies that assist in the critical analysis of [[art]].  They can be discussed as separate entities or by connecting them to meta-frames that are [[cultural]], [[Structuralism|structural]], [[subjectivity|subjective]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodern]].

==Overview==
The four agencies encompass the questions of "who, what, when, where and why", and are as follows:

# '''Artist''' – the role of the [[artist]] where the [[Work of art|art]] work is explored as the product of practitioners such as artists, [[artisan]]s, [[craft]]speople, [[architect]]s and [[design]]ers.  The artist can be seen as an individual or as a group or [[Art movement|movement]]. 
# '''Audience''' – the role and value of the [[audience]].  The concept of audience can be evaluated historically or critically.  The audience may be specific such as [[art historian]]s or [[critic]]s, or other members of the public such as students, [[art school|teacher]]s, [[patronage|art buyers]], etc. Or the audience may be abstract as when notions of "viewing" and "authorship" come into it. Artworks themselves are static, but the audience and their [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]] changes over time. 
# '''Artwork''' – artworks as real objects. This includes [[painting]]s, [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], design, [[performance art]], and genres of these, as well as presentations of an artist's personal and cultural [[Human self-reflection|reflection]]s. Additionally, there exists the opportunity for [[wikt:symbolic|symbolic]] interpretations and modern reinterpretations. 
# '''World''' – how interests "in the world" are represented in the art. This includes [[Socio-political]] aspects such as [[social class|class]], [[ideologies]], etc.; experiences of the world, personal to the artist or experienced by the collective; interests of the art world — movements, styles, innovations, pressures, [[technology]] and more.?

==Art frames==
"Art frames" are "meta-frames" which are generally associated with the [[conceptual art|conceptual]] framework and take the conceptual framework further. They include the structural, subjective, postmodern and cultural "frame" where art is understood as "text"&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''A Theory of Semiotics'', Indiana University Press, 1978. p 310 endnote #47&lt;/ref&gt; and language. In this way, art itself becomes analytical and self-aware.

The '''subjective frame''' comprises mainly feelings and [[emotion]]s expressed, and of audience response or interpretation.

The '''structural frame''' refers to physical techniques and principles applied to the artwork, such as [[List of artistic media|mediums]], overall structure, [[Facture (art)|facture]]&lt;ref&gt;"Facture", Chicago Journals, ''American Art'', Vol. 23, No. 1, Spring 2009 "Facture refers to the way a thing is made... Paying attention to facture is paying attention to artistic process."&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of symbols. (An example of facture is the work of French artist [[Daniel Buren]] and the work of wrapper [[Christo]].)
 
The '''cultural frame''' examines the influence of differing aspects of culture upon the artwork, such as race or class issues, [[religion]] or taste.

The '''postmodern frame''' does not apply only to [[postmodern art]]works, but as an attitude to artworks in general. Features of the postmodern frame include traditionally non-artistic aspects, such as [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], and the use of humour and [[irony]].

These frames can be applied in order to direct or analyse artworks in addition to the conceptual framework.

The '''Twenty-five Year Award''' is an [[List of architecture prizes|architecture prize]] awarded by the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) to buildings and structures that have "stood the test of time for 25 to 35 years",&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;[http://www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAB089482 Twenty-Five Year Award]. [[American Institute of Architects]]. Retrieved November 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "[exemplify] design of enduring significance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzszAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pjgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3602,2908222&amp;dq=twenty-five-year-award+architecture&amp;hl=en Haystack school to receive architecture award]. ''[[Bangor Daily News]]''. December 10, 1993. p. 24. Retrieved July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Twenty-five Year Award was first presented in 1969, and has been handed out every year from 1971 onward. In 2017, the prize was awarded to the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], for the project titled Grand Louvre – Phase I by [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]].

The project receiving the award can be located anywhere in the world, but must be designed by an architect licensed in the United States. Only four buildings outside of the United States have received the award, one each in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia|Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], [[London]], [[England]], and [[Paris]], [[France]]. [[New York City]] has the most awards at five, while [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[New Haven]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] are all tied in second with two awards each.

Buildings to which [[Finnish American]] architect [[Eero Saarinen]] has contributed have received six awards, tied with the architectural firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]. [[Louis I. Kahn]] has been honored five times. Buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] have received this award four times, and both [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] as well as the firm [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]] have each had three of their buildings honored. Of the 48 projects that have received this award, only two, [[Eames House]] and the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], had women as contributing architects.

==Eligibility==
The Twenty-five Year Award can be awarded to any type of architectural project and may be either a single structure or a group of structures that compose a larger whole.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; Past examples of projects winning the award in this way include both monuments, such as the [[Gateway Arch]] and [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and groupings of buildings, such as the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] and [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]]. Most buildings nominated for this award are new structures but one winner, [[Faneuil Hall#Faneuil Hall Marketplace|Faneuil Hall Marketplace]], was a substantial renovation of warehouses into a [[festival marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Robert. [http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2008/12/21/two_urban_drawing_cards_are_now_in_limbo/ Two urban drawing cards are now in limbo]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. December 21, 2008. Retrieved July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a project to be eligible to win the Twenty-five Year Award, it must have been built between 25 and 35 years before the year of the award. It must also have been designed by "an architect licensed in the United States at the time of the project’s completion". This means that the award candidate can be anywhere in the world, but must have been designed by a licensed American architect, such as the [[Fundació Joan Miró]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt;

To be nominated the project must be in a "substantially completed form" as well as "in good condition". Potential candidates must not have been altered substantially since they were built. Change of use is allowed by the rules, but the "original intent" of the structure must still be intact.&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt; These changes of use include reorganization of interior space. This was taken into account with the [[Price Tower]], which when built was a mix of offices and apartments, but when awarded, had only one apartment remaining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hWcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9CkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1949,5804096&amp;dq=twenty-five-year-award+aia&amp;hl=en AIA honors Wright tower].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6057">'''Urban Interventionism''' is a name sometimes given to a number of different kinds of activist design and art practices, art that typically responds to the social community, locational identity, the built environment, and public places. The goals are often to create new awareness of social issues, and to stimulate community involvement. Such practices have a history that includes certain street artists of the 1960s, such as The [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]] of San Francisco, or the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]] of Amsterdam, among many others.

Contemporary artists often associated with urban interventionist practices are  [[Daniel Buren]], [[Gordon Matta-Clark]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]],&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre, Theory, Postmodernism,'' by Johannes H. Birringer, Indiana University Press, 1991. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hirschhorn]], [[Francis Alÿs]], [[Harrell Fletcher]], the [[Red Peristyle]] group, [[Banksy]] and many others.

== Social and spatial  ==
Urban Interventionism has been associated with a changed understanding of the relationship between the social and the spatial, called the "spatial turn" of the arts and sciences in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Soja, E. Postmodern geographies: the reassertion of space in critical social theory. Verso, London and New York. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In this turn a new viewpoint was taken on public and urban spaces "...whereby urban spaces are seen not merely as containers for or outcomes of social processes, but as a medium through which they unfold and as having constitutive significance {{sic|themselve}}."&lt;ref name=pinder /&gt; According to this train of thought the spatial sights of a city have the power to shape interactions and create new experiences. This power is utilized by urban interventions through the works created by the artists.

== Ideology ==
Urban interventionism often target local communities as their targets. There are different strands of activity within urban interventionism. While mostly activistic, many artists have different focus points. George Yúdice, Professor of American Studies Program
and of Spanish and Portuguese at [[New York University]], defines the term as referring to "public or participatory art through which publics constitute themselves and experience something extraordinary in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heuristics of Contemporary Urban Art Interventions Dimension,'' from introduction to "Urban Interventions: A Symposium on Art and the City," York University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous street artist [[Banksy]], for example, has done a few famous urban interventions. Some of these are political statements, like his [http://www.stencilrevolution.com/banksy-art-prints/flying-balloons-girl/ stencil] of a girl using balloons filled with helium to float over the wall between Palestine and Israel.   Professor David Pinder of the [[University of London]] stated that urban interventions are often specifically directed towards the urban space that it is situated in: ''"(urban interventions)...are typically concerned less with representing political issues than with intervening in urban spaces so as to question, refunction and contest prevailing norms and ideologies, and to create new meanings, experiences, understandings, relationships and situations.''"&lt;ref name=pinder&gt;Pinder, David. Urban Interventions: Art, Politics and Pedagogy. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research. Volume 32.3, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a more situational urban intervention is the [http://RedBall%20project RedBall project] by [[Kurt Perschke]]. The project consists of a large inflatable red ball that has been set up at many different sites worldwide, providing a new engaging space for people to interact with.

== Disciplines ==
Much of the work is multidisciplinary and intermedial, combining art forms or creating works that are hard to classify. Artists working in this international vein often utilize outdoor video projection, found objects, sculptural artifacts, posters, and performance events that might include and involve passersby on the street. Urban interventions are not first objects to pursue the creation of meaning in urban space through the combination of art forms, and they have been linked to artists and philosophers of the 1960's. In 1968 philosopher and sociologist [[Henri Lefebvre]] wrote the ''Le Droit à la ville'' ([[Right to the city|Right to the City]]), in which he states that: 
: "''To put art at the service of the urban does not mean to prettify urban space with works of art. This parody of the possible is a caricature. Rather, this means that time-spaces become works of art and that former art reconsiders itself as source and model of appropriation of space and time.''"&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, H. Right to the city. In H. Lefebvre, Writings on cities, E. Kofman and E. Lebas (trans. and eds.), Blackwell, Oxford [originally published in French]. 1996 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

This also echoes other art forms that are connected to urban interventionalism like the 1960's [[Happening]]s and [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Gesamtkunstwerk]]. These also saw urban space as a medium, bringing art into peoples' daily lives.
