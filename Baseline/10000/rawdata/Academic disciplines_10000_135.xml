Alcohol is a depressant. After consumption, alcohol causes the body’s systems to slow down. Often, feelings of [[drunkenness]] are associated with elation and happiness but other feelings of anger or depression can arise. Balance, judgment, and coordination are also negatively affected. One of the most significant short term side effects of alcohol is reduced inhibition. Reduced inhibitions can lead to an increase in sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="LC2" /&gt;

As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency.&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;

== In women ==
In women, the effects of alcohol on libido in the literature are mixed. Some women report that alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, however, some studies show alcohol lower the physiological signs of arousal.&lt;ref name="B32"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ackerman|first2=KT|year=1995|title=Women, alcohol, and sexuality|journal=[[Recent Developments in Alcoholism]]|volume=12|pages=267–85|pmid=7624547|last1=Beckman|first1=LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that alcohol negatively affected how positive the sexual experience was in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=M.

Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women's bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;ref name="LC22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=George|first2=WH|year=1989|title=Alcohol and human sexuality: Review and integration|journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=374–86|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.374|pmid=2660179|last1=Crowe|first1=LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; Some women report a greater [[sexual arousal]] with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]], which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

Psychologically, alcohol has also played a role in sexual behavior. It has been reported that women who were intoxicated believed they were more sexually aroused than before consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; This psychological effect contrasts with the physiological effects measured, but refers back to the loss of inhibitions because of alcohol. Often, alcohol can influence the capacity for a woman to feel more relaxed and in turn, be more sexual. Alcohol may be considered by some women to be a sexual disinhibitor.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

==Drug facilitated sexual assault==
{{main article|Drug facilitated sexual assault}}

Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), also known as predator rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed [[alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. The unofficial term "date rape drug" came into widespread usage in the early 1990s through U.S. news media reports. Researchers say that unlike other types of rape, DFSA is not a crime of physical violence: it is a crime of sexual [[hedonism]] and entitlement.&lt;ref name="Welner 2008"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Welner | first2=Barbara | last2=Welner | chapter=Chapter 23: Drug-Facilitated Sex Assault | pages=445–462 | editor1-first=Robert R. | editor1-last=Hazelwood | editor2-first=Ann Wolbert | editor2-last=Burgess | title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation: A Multidisciplinary Approach | edition=4th | publisher=CRC Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4200-6504-6 | doi=10.1201/9781420065053.ch23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A date rape drug, also called a predator drug, is any drug that can be used to assist in the execution of [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA). The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim ingested drugs willingly for recreational purposes, or had them administered surreptitiously:&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=978-0849398087|pages=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the latter type of [[assault]] that the term "date rape drug" most often refers to.

==Sexual risk-taking==
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviours, such as [[unprotected sex]].&lt;ref name="G4"/&gt; It is unclear whether the two are linked or the [[personality type]]s of people who often drink large amounts of alcohol are more tolerant of risk-taking.

Alcohol is linked to a large proportion of unwanted outcomes associated with sex such as [[date rape]], [[unwanted pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;

=="Beer goggles"{{anchor|Beer_goggles}}== &lt;!-- [[Beer goggles]], [[Cider visor]], and [[Stella vision]] all redirect to this section --&gt;
"Beer goggles" is a slang term for the phenomenon in which consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] lowers [[sexual inhibition]]s to the point that very little or no discretion is used when approaching or choosing sexual partners. The term is often humorously applied when an individual is observed making, and later regretting, advances towards a partner who would be deemed unattractive or inappropriate when sober. The "beer goggles" are considered to have distorted the "wearer's" vision, making unattractive people appear beautiful, or at least passably attractive.

A study published in 2003 supported the beer goggles hypothesis; however, it also found that another explanation is that regular drinkers tend to have personality traits that mean they find people more attractive, whether or not they are under the influence of alcohol at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Statues of Hindu Deities at Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam 07.jpg|thumb|A statue of a cow at the Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam]]
'''Animal worship''' (or '''zoolatry''') refers to rituals involving animals, such as the glorification of '''animal deities''' or [[animal sacrifice]]. When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed ([[#Reference-idTeeter2002|Teeter et al., 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]] prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are [[unclean animals|unclean]].

The idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by [[Abrahamic]] religions ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). In [[Independent Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, animals have very little religious significance ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;24).

The [[Egyptian pantheon]] was especially fond of [[zoomorphism]], with many animals sacred to particular deities—[[cat]]s to [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]], [[ibis]]es and [[baboon]]s to [[Thoth]], [[crocodile]]s to [[Sobek]] and [[Ra]], fish to [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[mongoose]], [[shrew]] and [[bird]]s to [[Horus]], dogs and [[jackal]]s to [[Anubis]], serpents and [[eel]]s to [[Atum]], [[beetle]]s to [[Khepera]], bulls to [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Animals were often [[Animal Mummies|mummified]] as a result of these beliefs.

==Hunting cults==

===Bear===
{{Main|Bear worship}}
There is evidence that connects the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as "bears" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a [[nymph]] into a bear and then into the constellation [[Ursa Major]].

The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;435). However, others argue that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as wind, sediment, or water ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;437-438).

[[Image:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]
The [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear "[[kamui]]" in [[Ainu language|their language]], which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term "kamui" is used, it essentially means a bear ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;348).

===Whale===
[[Image:Bộ cốt cá voi.jpg|right|thumb|The largest whale skeleton in Vietnam at [[:vi:Vạn Thủy Tú|Vạn Thủy Tú temple]], one of [[:vi:Tục thờ cá Ông|Vietnamese Whale worship]] in [[Vietnamese folk religion]]s]]

Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe ([[#Reference-idBird2007|Bird 2007]]). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.

A prevalent [[whale]] cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4).
Buddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

In Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445).

In China, ''Yu-kiang'', a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

In the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale ([[#Reference-idFrazer1913|Frazer 1913]], p.&amp;nbsp;72).

[[Paikea]] (also maori name for [[humpback whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-whanau-puha-whales&lt;/ref&gt;), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of [[Mangaia]], in the present day [[Cook Islands]], was said by the Kati Kuri people of [[Kaikoura]] to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of ''Tohora'' (maori name for [[southern right whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara /&gt;) a whale many centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/whales/EducationResource.aspx?irn=198|title=Whales|last=Anon|work=Tinirau education resource|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whale features in [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

The [[Tlingit]] people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water ([[#Reference-idHeimlichBoran2001|Heimlich &amp; Boran 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;7).

In Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.&lt;ref name="worldtrans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrans.org/creators/whale/myths0.html|title=Whale Mythology from around the World|last=Anon|work=The Creative Continuum|publisher=worldtrans.org|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

{{Anchor|Whales in the Bible}}
The Bible mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The "sea monsters" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word "jackals" instead ([http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm Lamentations 4:3]).&lt;!-- "sea monsters" (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin "sea calves" (seals) --&gt; The story of [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a "big Fish" is told both in the Qur'an ({{Cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}) and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40 ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1-4 Jonah 1-4]).

==Domesticated mammals==

===Cattle and buffalo===

{{Main|bull worship|Cattle in religion}}

Many religions have considered [[cattle in religion|cattle]] to be sacred, most famously [[Hinduism]] from India and Nepal, but also [[Zoroastrianism]], and ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Toda (tribe)|Toda]] of southern [[India]] abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.

Conspicuous among Egyptian animal cults was that of the bull, [[Apis (god)|Apis]]. It was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old Apis died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at [[Nilopolis]]. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it when once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. Less widespread was the cult of the [[Mnevis]], also consecrated to [[Osiris]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper [[Nile]]. The [[Nuba]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] revere cattle. The [[Angoni]] of Central Africa and the [[Sakalava]] of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In [[India]] respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

While there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). The [[humped zebu]], a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, [[Brahma]] and [[Prithu]], the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64).

According to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65-66).

===Sheep===
{{Main|Sheep#In religion and folklore}}

[[Amun]], the god of [[Thebes, Egypt]], was represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). Another Egyptian ram-headed god was ''Banebdjed'', a form of [[Osiris]].

===Goat===
{{Main|Goat#Religion, mythology, and folklore}}
[[File:Mosaic Pan Genazzano Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138–192 CE.]]
[[Silenus]], the [[Satyr]]s and the [[Faun]]s were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, [[Leszi]], is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A deity known as the Goat of [[Mendes]] is associated with the [[pentagram]].

In Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive. The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Excavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286).

===Dog===
[[Image:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being decorated in the [[Kukur tihar]] festival in Nepal.]]
{{Main|Dogs in religion}}

Dogs have a major religious significance among the [[Hindu]]s in [[Nepal]] and some parts of [[India]]. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that the dog is a messenger of ''[[Yama]]'', the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of [[Heaven]]. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the [[lunar cycle]] in November as '''Kukur-tihar''', as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying ''[[Tilaka|tika]]'' (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flower.

Actual dog worship is uncommon. The [[Nosarii]] of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The [[Karang Jiwo|Karang]] of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In [[Nepal]] it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the [[Harranian]]s dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

===Horse===
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|The Uffington White Horse]]
{{Main|Horse worship}}

[[Horse worship]] has been practiced by a number of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. There is some reason to believe that [[Poseidon]], like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a [[horse]]. In the cave of [[Phigalia]] [[Demeter]] was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] bore this form. Her priests were called [[Poloi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "colts") in [[Laconia]]. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god [[Consus]]. In [[Gaul]] we find a horse-goddess, [[Epona]]. There are also traces of a horse-god, [[Rudiobus]]. [[Hayagriva]] is a horse-headed deity that appears in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Gonds]] in India worship a horse-god, [[Koda Pen]], in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

Among the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth ([[#Reference-idVukanović1980|Vukanović 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32).

===Elephant===
{{main|Cultural depictions of elephants}}

[[Image:13th century Ganesha statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A statue of [[Ganesha]] - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal]]
In [[Thailand]] it is believed that a white [[elephant]] may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In [[Cambodia]] it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at [[Ennarea]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). In India, the popular Hindu god [[Ganesha]] has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.

In [[Surat]], unmarried Anāvil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alunām ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393). This holiday is to honor the goddess [[Pārvatī]]. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate [[Pārvatī]]'s creation of [[Ganesha]] from a paste of either [[turmeric]] or [[sandalwood]]). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alunām, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393).

Certain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in [[Sumatra]] ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). Stone elephant figurines were built as "seats of the souls" in the Sumatran culture ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). In [[North Borneo]], however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41).

==Wild mammals==
[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Artemis]] with a deer, the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' in the Louvre ''Galerie des Caryatides'' that was designed for it]]

In North America the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had as their chief deity a "mighty great [[hare]]" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as [[Nanabozho|Menabosho]] or [[Michabo]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Deer in mythology|deer]] is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess [[Artemis]], while in [[Hinduism]] it is linked to the goddess [[Saraswati]]. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The golden stag figurine found in the [[Pazyryk burials]] is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.

The cult of the [[leopard]] is widely found in West Africa. Among the [[Ashanti people]] a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the first known cat-headed deity was [[Mafdet]]. During the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] 2920–2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the [[Pharaoh]]'s chambers against [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s and evil. She was often depicted with a head of a leopard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Divine Cat and the Snake in Egypt |author=Hornblower, G.D. |journal=Man |year=1943 |issue=43 |pages=85−87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion]]-headed deity [[Sekhmet]] was considered a daughter of [[Ra]] and was worshipped as protector of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engels, D.W. |year=2001 |title=Classical Cats.

There was a lion-god at [[Baalbek]]. The [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabs]] worshipped the lion-god [[Yaghuth]]. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the [[Balonda]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). The lion was also sacred to [[Hebat]], the [[mother goddess]] of the [[Hurrians]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In [[Judaism]] the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, a "Young Lion" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the [[Lion of Judah]] started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as [[Jesus]] and [[Haile Selassie I]], the ''ras'' Tafari.

In Mesoamerica [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|the jaguar was revered]] as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Olmec]], and had an important role in shamanism.

Of great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] is one of the 12 [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] animals. Also in various [[Chinese art]] and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the [[Chinese dragon]]- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] ({{zh|c=白虎|p=Bái Hǔ}}) is one of the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellation]]s. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎), and it represents the [[west]] and the autumn season ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character 王 ("king") ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

Some cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of [[Kunming]], China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the Yi is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380).

Along with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, [[Queen Mother of the West|Hsi Wang Mu]], sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;80).

In many parts of Vietnam, the [[tiger]] is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.

The tiger is associated with the [[Hindu]] deities [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]]. In [[Pokhara]], Nepal the tiger festival is known as [[Bagh Jatra]]. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and "hunted". The [[Warli]] tribe of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). In [[Vietnamese folk religion]] and [[Dongbei folk religion]] tiger-gods are also found.

===Monkey===
[[File:Hear speak see no evil Toshogu.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[three wise monkeys]] over the [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] shrine in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]]]]
{{Main|Monkey}}
In Hinduism the monkey deity, [[Hanuman]], is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

[[Chinese religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|mythologies]] give monkeys and apes [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Religious significance|cultural significance]] as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, [[Sun Wukong]] or "Monkey King" is the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s picaresque novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In traditional [[Chinese folk religion]], monkeys are supernatural beings that could [[shape shift]] into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' "breath; life force" through the Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' "guiding and pulling". Similar to Daoism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' say that [[Gautama Buddha]] was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the [[Chan Buddhist]] "[[mind monkey]]" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.

Monkeys are said to be worshipped in [[Togo]]. At [[Porto Novo]], in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

===Rodent===
In some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.

==Birds==

===Crow/raven===
{{Main|Raven in mythology}}

The [[Raven]] is the chief deity of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people of [[Alaska]]. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.

In the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the [[totem]] and [[Apical ancestor|ancestor]] of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as ''Grandfather Raven''. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a [[Creator deity|creator]] Raven who is different from the [[trickster]] Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.

Together with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Religions]], where they were connected to [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and the [[Morrigan]] in the former and [[Woden]] in the latter.

===Hawk===
North Borneo treated the [[hawk]] as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). In North [[Borneo]] we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the [[Kenyahs]], the [[Kayans]] and the sea [[Dyaks]]. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, [[Laki Neho]], but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, [[Laki Tenangan]]. [[Singalang Burong]], the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

According to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). This particular bird was "a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes" ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). The hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. The souls of former pharaohs were the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). Horus was depicted by the Egyptians as a human body with a hawk head after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty, but before that he was represented as a hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;27).

Egypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.

===Frigatebird===
On [[Easter Island]] until the 1860s there was a [[Tangata manu]] (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and [[Petroglyphs]] of Birdmen (half men half [[frigatebird]]s). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first [[sooty tern]] egg of the season from the islet of [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Moto Iti]] and take it to [[Orongo]].

The Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Make-make]], the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374).

==Other non-mammals==

===Serpent===
{{Main|Snake worship }}
[[Image:Naga3.jpg|thumb| right|The altar where serpent deities are worshipped in a temple in [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Karnataka]], India]]
[[Image:Quetzalcoatl telleriano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]
The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the [[Old World]], and in the Americas ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In India [[snake worship]] refers to the high status of [[snake]]s in [[Hindu mythology]]. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras ([[Naga (mythology)|nagas]]) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the "king of the serpents" was worshipped. Instead of the "king of the serpents," actual live snakes were worshipped in South India ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, [[Manasa]] ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1).

In Africa the chief centre of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship was [[Dahomey]]. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

The Ancient Egyptians worshiped a number of snake gods, including [[Apep|Apophis]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and the Sumerians before them had a serpent god [[Ningizzida]].

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish in culture}}

[[Image:Dagon1.jpg|thumb|A modern interpretation of Dagon as a "fish-god"]]
According to the [[Jewish]] scholar [[Rashi]], the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Dagon]] was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered [[relief]]s suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

In Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2).

During Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Large marine [[megafauna]]s such as whales and [[whale shark]]s (also called as "Ebisu-shark") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen.&lt;ref name="大藤1955" /&gt;

==Oracular animals==
Animals are frequently used for the purposes of [[divination]].
[[Bird]]s are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. [[Augury]] was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in [[Classical Antiquity]]. The [[dove]] appears as an oracular animal in the story of [[Noah]], and also in [[Thisbe]] in [[Boeotia]] there was a dove-oracle of [[Zeus]]. Animal imagery was also often employed in the [[oracle|oracular utterances]] in Ancient Greece ([[#Reference-idLightfoot2008|Lightfoot 2008]], p.&amp;nbsp;237,&amp;nbsp;fn.&amp;nbsp;105). [[Parrot astrology]] is a form of divination using [[green parakeet]]s which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;{{cite web|last=Naidu Ratnala|first=Thulaja|title=Parrot astrologers|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_602_2005-01-04.html|work=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese traditional religion]], the [[tortoise]] is an oracular animal.

Notable oracular animals of the modern period include [[Lady Wonder]], [[Punxsutawney Phil]], [[Maggie the Monkey]], [[Lazdeika the Crab]], [[Paul the Octopus]], and [[Sonny Wool]].

==Shamanism and animals==
{{Main|Shamanism}}
Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as "assistant spirits," "guardian spirits," and "helping spirits," animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

An example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

In the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as "becoming animal" ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Animals were a central part of this religion ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167).

==Religion and animals==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}
{{see also|Life release|Buddhist vegetarianism}}

One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures ([[#Reference-idEpstein1990|Epstein 1990]]). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], pp.&amp;nbsp;234–235). The [[Dalai Lama]] once said "Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?" ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Qtd. in Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a [[vegetarian]] diet to avoid causing pain to animals ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;238).

Avoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist [[monk]]s do not travel during rainy seasons ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]], p.&amp;nbsp;22).

Living creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A [[jataka]], or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]]).

===Hinduism===
{{main|Cow protection movement|Cattle slaughter in India|Elephants in Kerala culture|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}
{{see also|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Ashvamedha}}

[[Hinduism]] is one of the six primary [[Religions in India|religions]] of [[India]] ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from [[Vedas|Vedic]] times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]]-influenced [[eras]] that led to a wider concept adoption of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] and respect for animals,  as a major constituent in [[Dharmic]] belief systems ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves [[Re-incarnation|re-incarnate]] as animals based on their deeds or [[karma]]. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223-224).

There are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism#Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society|special occasions]] and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in ''some'' parts of India ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;226).

===Jainism===
{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
{{see also|Jain vegetarianism}}

[[Mahavira]], the founder of [[Jainism]], believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow, like Buddhists, ahimsa and not harm any living creature ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;230).

Jainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

Food will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

Lay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;232).

'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US's [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, "brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|work = Post Register|location = Idaho Falls, ID|title = Cleaning house and charting a future at INL|last = Menser|first = Paul|publisher = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|archivedate = 2013-11-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus. These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095748/http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the "[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]" at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history|title=Argonne: History|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the "Metallurgical Laboratory" was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for "cooperative research in nucleonics." At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called "Argonne-West," to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, "[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]" page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950–1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified "hot zone". He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J. Edgar Hoover and Paul Harvey |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2010-01-23 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012202602.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson "Nels" Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the "Janus" reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909173546/http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html |archivedate=9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

[[File:Memory-seals.jpg|thumb|Graphical memory devices from the works of [[Giordano Bruno]]]]

The '''art of memory''' (Latin: ''ars memoriae'') is any of a number of loosely associated [[mnemonic]] principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. An alternative and frequently used term is "Ars Memorativa" which is also often translated as "art of memory" although its more literal meaning is "Memorative Art". It is sometimes referred to as ''mnemotechnics''.&lt;ref&gt;In her general introduction to the subject (''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p4) Frances Yates suggests that "it may be misleading to dismiss it with the label 'mnemotechnics'" and "The word 'mnemotechnics' hardly conveys what the artificial memory of Cicero may have been like". Furthermore, "mnemotechnics", etymologically speaking, emphasizes practical application, whereas the art of memory certainly includes general principles and a certain degree of 'theory'.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an 'art' in the Aristotelian sense, which is to say a method or set of prescriptions that adds order and discipline to the pragmatic, natural activities of human beings.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_123"&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; It has existed as a recognized group of principles and techniques since at least as early as the middle of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;Simonedes of Ceos, the poet credited by the ancients with the discovery of fundamental principles of this art, was active around 500 BCE, and in any case a fragment known as the ''Dialexis'', which is dated to about 400 BCE contains a short section on memory which outlines features known to be central to the fully developed classical art. Frances A. Yates, The Art of Memory, University of Chicago Press, 1966, pp 27-30. The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Third Edition, Ed. Hornblower and Spawforth, 1999, p1409.&lt;/ref&gt; and was usually associated with training in [[rhetoric]] or [[logic]], but variants of the art were employed in other contexts, particularly the religious and  the magical.

Techniques commonly employed in the art include the association of emotionally striking memory images within visualized locations, the chaining or association of groups of images, the association of images with schematic graphics or ''notae'' ("signs, markings, figures" in Latin), and the association of text with images. Any or all of these techniques were often used in combination with the contemplation or study of architecture, books, sculpture and painting, which were seen by practitioners of the art of memory as externalizations of internal memory images and/or organization.

Because of the variety of principles and techniques, and their various applications, some researchers refer to "the arts of memory", rather than to a single art.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_123"/&gt;

==Origins and history==
It has been suggested that the art of memory originated among the [[Pythagoreans]] or perhaps even earlier among the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, but no conclusive evidence has been presented to support these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary classical sources for the art of memory which deal with the subject at length include the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (Bk III), [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De oratore]]'' (Bk II 350-360), and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (Bk XI). Additionally, the art is mentioned in fragments from earlier Greek works including the ''[[Dialexis]]'', dated to approximately 400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] wrote extensively on the subject of memory, and mentions the technique of the placement of images to lend order to memory. Passages in his works ''[[On The Soul]]'' and ''[[On Memory|On Memory and Reminiscence]]'' proved to be influential in the later revival of the art among [[Medieval philosophy|medieval Scholastics]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's assertion that we cannot contemplate or understand without an image in the mind's eye representing the thing considered was also highly influential. Aristotle, De Anima 3.8 in ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common account of the creation of the art of memory centers around the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]], a famous [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek poet]], who was invited to chant a [[lyric poem]] in honor of his host, a nobleman of [[Thessaly]]. While praising his host, Simonides also mentioned the twin gods [[Castor and Pollux]].  When the recital was complete, the nobleman selfishly told Simonides that he would only pay him half of the agreed upon payment for the [[panegyric]], and that he would have to get the balance of the payment from the two gods he had mentioned. A short time later, Simonides was told that two men were waiting for him outside.  He left to meet the visitors but could find no one.  Then, while he was outside the banquet hall, it collapsed, crushing everyone within. The bodies were so disfigured that they could not be identified for proper burial. But, Simonides was able to remember where each of the guests had been sitting at the table, and so was able to identify them for burial. This experience suggested to Simonides the principles which were to become central to the later development of the art he reputedly invented.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He inferred that persons desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental images of the things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the things, and the images of the things will denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and the images respectively as a [[wax tablet|wax writing-tablet]] and the letters written upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De oratore, II, lxxxvi, 351-4, English translation by E.W. Sutton and H. Rackham from Loeb Classics Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Art of memory, "De praeternaturali utriusque..." Fludd, 1621 Wellcome L0016208.jpg|thumb|''Ars Memoriæ'', by Robert Fludd]]

The early [[Christian monasticism|Christian monks]] adapted techniques common in the art of memory as an art of composition and [[Christian meditation|meditation]], which was in keeping with the [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] and [[Dialectic|dialectical]] context in which it was originally taught. It became the basic method for reading and meditating upon the Bible after making the text secure within one's memory. Within this tradition, the art of memory was passed along to the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] (or Early Modern period). When Cicero and Quintilian were revived after the 13th century, humanist scholars understood the language of these ancient writers within the context of the medieval traditions they knew best, which were profoundly altered by monastic practices of meditative reading and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] was an important influence in promoting the art when he defined it as a part of [[Prudence]] and recommended its use to meditate on the virtues and to improve one's piety.  In [[scholasticism]] artificial memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/artificial_memory|title=artificial memory - definition of artificial memory in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be used as a method for recollecting the whole universe and the roads to Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers &amp; Ziolkowski 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were particularly important in promoting its uses,&lt;ref&gt;Bolzoni 2004&lt;/ref&gt; see for example [[Cosmos Rossellius]].

The [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] - who from 1582 until his death in 1610, worked to introduce [[Christianity]] to [[China]] - described the system of places and images in his work, ''A Treatise On Mnemonics''. However, he advanced it only as an aid to passing examinations (a kind of rote memorization) rather than as a means of new composition, though it  had traditionally been taught, both in dialectics and in rhetoric, as a tool for such composition or 'invention'. Ricci was apparently trying to gain favour with the Chinese imperial service, which required a notoriously difficult entry examination.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|alt=|thumb|One of Giordano Bruno's simpler pieces]]
Perhaps following the example of [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]], vaguely described in Quintilian's ''Institutio oratoria'', [[Giordano Bruno]], a defrocked Dominican, used a variation of the art in which the trained memory was based in some fashion upon the zodiac. Apparently, his elaborate method was also based in part on the combinatoric concentric circles of [[Ramon Llull]], in part upon schematic diagrams in keeping with medieval ''Ars Notoria'' traditions, in part upon groups of words and images associated with late antique [[Hermeticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruno's use of groups of words may also be associated with the use of shorthand, or with techniques associated with shorthand in antiquity. Yates (1966) mentions the possibility of a relationship between shorthand ''notae'' and the art(s) of memory (p15 ''footnote 16'') and the possible role of shorthand ''notae'' in 'magical' memory training (p43). ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' (Third Edition, 1999, in the article "tachygraphy") discusses the formal characteristics of late Hellenistic shorthand manuals, noting "These show a fully organized system, composed of a syllabary and a (so-called) Commentary, consisting of groups of words, arranged in fours or occasionally eights, with a sign attached to each, which had to memorized." This can be compared with Bruno's atria in ''De Imaginum, Signorum, et Idearum Compositione'' (1591) in which groups of 24 words are each associated within an atrium with ''Atrii Imago'' (e.g. ''Altare'', ''Basili'', ''Carcer'', ''Domus'', etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in part upon the classical architectural mnemonic. According to one influential interpretation, his memory system was intended to fill the mind of the practitioner with images representing all knowledge of the world, and was to be used, in a magical sense, as an avenue to reach the intelligible world beyond appearances, and thus enable one to powerfully influence events in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966; ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  Such enthusiastic claims for the encyclopedic reach of the art of memory are a feature of the early Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the "Memory Theater" of Giulio Camillo discussed by Yates (1966, pp 129-159)&lt;/ref&gt; but the art also gave rise to better-known developments in logic and [[scientific method]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this transition was not without its difficulties, and during this period the belief in the effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (to say nothing of the esteem in which its practitioners were held) steadily became [[occult|occluded]]. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the [[Puritans]] attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers &amp; Ziolkowski 2002; Rossi 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for the steady decline in the importance of the art of memory from the 16th to the 20th century is offered by the late [[Ioan P. Culianu]],  who argued that it was suppressed during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] when Protestants and reactionary Catholics alike worked to eradicate pagan influence and the lush visual imagery of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Culianu 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the causes, in keeping with general developments, the art of memory eventually came to be defined primarily as a part of [[Dialectics]], and was assimilated in the 17th century by [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]] into the curriculum of Logic, where it survives to this day as a necessary foundation for the teaching of Argument.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi 2000 p102; Bolzoni 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplified variants of the art of memory were also taught through the 19th century as useful to public orators, including preachers and [[Individual_events_(speech)#After_Dinner_Speaking|after-dinner speaker]]s.

==Principles==

===Visual sense and spatial orientation===
Perhaps the most important principle of the art is the dominance of the visual sense in combination with the orientation of 'seen' objects within space. This principle is reflected in the early ''Dialexis'' fragment on memory, and is found throughout later texts on the art. [[Mary Carruthers]], in a review of [[Hugh of St. Victor]]'s ''Didascalion'', emphasizes the importance of the visual sense as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even what we hear must be attached to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking as well as the appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, pp. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage emphasizes the association of the visual sense with spatial orientation. The image of the speaker is placed ''in a room''. The importance of the visual sense in the art of memory would seem to lead naturally to the importance of a spatial context, given that our sight and depth-perception naturally position images seen within space.

===Order===
The positioning of images in virtual space leads naturally to an order, furthermore, an order to which we are naturally accustomed as biological organisms, deriving as it does from the sense perceptions we use to orient ourselves in the world. This fact perhaps sheds light on the relationship between the ''artificial'' and the ''natural'' memory, which were clearly distinguished in antiquity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is possible for one with a well-trained memory to compose clearly in an organized fashion on several different subjects. Once one has the all-important starting-place of the ordering scheme and the contents firmly in their places within it, it is quite possible to move back and forth from one distinct composition to another without losing one's place or becoming confused.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again discussing Hugh of St. Victor's works on memory, Carruthers clearly notes the critical importance of order in memory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One must have a rigid, easily retained order, with a definite beginning. Into this order one places the components of what one wishes to memorize and recall. As a [[money-changer]] ("nummularium") separates and classifies his coins by type in his [[money bag]] ("sacculum," "marsupium"), so the contents of wisdom's storehouse ("thesaurus," "archa"), which is the memory, must be classified according to a definite, orderly scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Limited sets===
Many works discussing the art of memory emphasize the importance of ''brevitas'' and ''divisio'', or the breaking up of a long series into more manageable sets. This is reflected in advice on forming images or groups of images which can be taken in at a single glance, as well as in  discussions of memorizing lengthy passages, "A long text must always be broken up into short segments, numbered, then memorized a few pieces at a time."&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known in modern terminology as [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]].

===Association===
[[File:Johann Romberch, Congestorium artificiose... Wellcome L0032270.jpg|thumb|''Congestorium artificiose memoriae'', by Johann Romberch]]

Association was considered to be of critical importance for the practice of the art. However, it was clearly recognized that associations in memory are idiosyncratic, hence, what works for one will not automatically work for all. For this reason, the [[associative value]]s given for images in memory texts are usually intended as examples and are not intended to be "universally normative". Yates offers a passage from Aristotle that briefly outlines the principle of association. In it, he mentions the importance of a starting point to initiate a chain of recollection, and the way in which it serves as a stimulating cause.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For this reason some use places for the purposes of recollecting. The reason for this is that men pass rapidly from one step to the next; for instance from milk to white, from white to air, from air to damp; after which one recollects autumn, supposing that one is trying to recollect the season.&lt;ref&gt;''De memoria et reminiscentia'', 452 8-16, cited in Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p34&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Affect===
The importance of affect or emotion in the art of memory is frequently discussed. The role of emotion in the art can be divided into two major groupings: the first is the role of emotion in the process of seating or fixing images in the memory, the second is the way in which the recollection of a memory image can evoke an emotional response.

One of the earliest sources discussing the art, the ''Ad Herennium''  emphasizes the importance of using emotionally striking imagery to ensure that the images will be retained in memory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We ought, then, to set up images of a kind that can adhere longest in memory. And we shall do so if we establish similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Herrenium'', III, xxii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the image associated with an emotion will call up the emotion when recollected. Carruthers discusses this in the context of the way in which the trained medieval memory was thought to be intimately related with the development of prudence or moral judgement.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since each phantasm is a combination not only of the neutral form of the perception, but of our response to it (''intentio'') concerning whether it is helpful or hurtful, the phantasm by its very nature evokes emotion. This is how the phantasm and the memory which stores it helps to cause or bring  into being moral excellence and ethical judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, 1990, pp. 67-71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern terminology, the concept that salient, bizarre, shocking, or simply unusual information will be more easily remembered can be referred to as the [[Von Restorff effect]].

===Repetition===
The well-known role of repetition in the common process of memorization of course plays a role in the more complex techniques of the art of memory. The earliest of the references to the art of memory, the ''Dialexis'', mentioned above, makes this clear: "repeat again what you hear; for by often hearing and saying the same things, what you have learned comes complete into your memory."&lt;ref&gt;from the excerpt of this work available in Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p29&lt;/ref&gt; Similar advice is a commonplace in later works on the art of memory.

==Techniques==
The art of memory employed a number of techniques which can be grouped as follows for purposes of discussion, however they were usually used in some combination:

===Architectural mnemonic===
{{main|Method of loci}}
The architectural mnemonic was a key group of techniques employed in the art of memory. It is based on the use of places (Latin ''loci''), which were memorized by practitioners as the framework or ordering structure that would 'contain' the images or signs 'placed' within it to record experience or knowledge. To use this method one might walk through a building several times, viewing distinct places within it, in the same order each time. After the necessary repetitions of this process, one should be able to remember and visualize each of the places reliably and in order. If one wished to remember, for example, a speech, one could break up the content of the speech into images or signs used to memorize its parts, which would then be 'placed' in the locations previously memorized. The components of the speech could then be recalled in order by imagining that one is walking through the building again, visiting each of the loci in order, viewing the images there, and thereby recalling the elements of the speech in order. A reference to these techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. These techniques, or variants, are sometimes referred to as [[Method of loci|"the method of loci"]], which is discussed in a separate section below. 

The primary source for the architectural mnemonic is the anonymous ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', a Latin work on rhetoric from the first century BCE. It is unlikely that the technique originated with the author of the ''Ad Herennium''. The technique is also mentioned by [[Cicero]] and Quintilian. According to the account in the ''Ad Herennium'' (Book III) backgrounds or 'places' are like wax tablets, and the images that are 'placed' on or within them are like writing. Real physical locations were apparently commonly used as the basis of memory places, as the author of the ''Ad Herennium'' suggests

&lt;blockquote&gt;
it will be more advantageous to obtain backgrounds in a deserted than in a populous region, because the crowding and passing to and fro of people confuse and weaken the impress of the images, while solitude keeps their outlines sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 31, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, real physical locations were not the only source of places. The author goes on to suggest

&lt;blockquote&gt;
if we are not content with our ready-made supply of backgrounds, we may in our imagination create a region for ourselves and obtain a most serviceable distribution of appropriate backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 32, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Places or backgrounds hence require, and reciprocally impose, order (often deriving from the spatial characteristics of the physical location memorized, in cases where an actual physical structure provided the basis for the 'places'). This order itself organizes the images, preventing confusion during recall. The anonymous author also advises that places should be well lit, with orderly intervals, and distinct from one another. He recommends a virtual 'viewing distance' sufficient to allow the viewer to encompass the space and the images it contains with a single glance.

Turning to images, the anonymous author asserts that they are of two kinds: those establishing a likeness based upon subject, and those establishing a likeness based upon a word. This was the basis for the subsequent distinction, commonly found in works on the art of memory, between 'memory for words' and 'memory for things'. He provides the following famous example of a likeness based upon subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Often we encompass the record of an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor has said that the defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin ''testiculi'' suggests ''testes'' or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 33, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to memorize likenesses based on words he provides an example of a verse and describes how images may be placed, each of which corresponds to words in the verse. He notes however that the technique will not work without combination with rote memorization of the verse, so that the images call to mind the previously memorized words.

The architectural mnemonic was also related to the broader concept of learning and thinking. Aristotle considered the technique in relation to topica, or conceptual areas or issues. In his ''Topics'' he suggested

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For just as in a person with a trained memory, a memory of things themselves is immediately caused by the mere mention of their places, so these habits too will make a man readier in reasoning, because he has his premisses classified before his mind's eye, each under its number.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Topica, 163, 24-30 (translated by W.A. Pickard-Cambridge in Works of Aristotle, ed. W.D. Ross, Oxford, 1928, Vol. I), cited in Yates, The Art of Memory, 1966, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Graphical mnemonic===
Because of the influence of the pioneering work of [[Frances Yates]], the architectural mnemonic is often characterized as the art of memory itself. However, primary sources show that from very early in the development of the art, non-physical or abstract locations and/or spatial graphics were employed as memory 'places'. Perhaps the most famous example of such an abstract system of 'places' is the memory system of Metrodorus of Scepsis, who was said by Quintilian to have organized his memory using a system of backgrounds in which he "found three hundred and sixty places in the twelve signs of the zodiac through which the sun moves". Some researchers (L.A. Post and Yates) believe it likely that Metorodorus organized his memory using places based in some way upon the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; In any case Quintilian makes it clear that non-alphabetic signs can be employed as memory images, and even goes on to mention how 'shorthand' signs (''notae'') can be used to signify things that would otherwise be impossible to capture in the form of a definite image (he gives "conjunctions" as an example).&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, Institutio oratoria, XI, ii, 23-26, Loeb Edition English translation by H. E. Butler&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it clear that though the architectural mnemonic with its buildings, niches and three-dimensional images was a major theme of the art as practiced in classical times, it often employed signs or notae and sometimes even non-physical imagined spaces. During the period of migration of barbarian tribes and the transformation of the Roman empire the architectural mnemonic fell into disuse. However the use of tables, charts and signs appears to have continued and developed independently. Mary Carruthers has made it clear that a trained memory occupied a central place in late antique and medieval pedagogy, and has documented some of the ways in which the development of medieval memorial arts was intimately intertwined with the emergence of the book as we understand it today. Examples of the development of the potential inherent in the graphical mnemonic include the lists and combinatory wheels of the Majorcan Ramon Llull. The Art of Signs (Latin ''Ars Notoria'') is also very likely a development of the graphical mnemonic. Yates mentions [[Apollonius of Tyana]] and his reputation for memory, as well as the association between trained memory, astrology and divination.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to suggest

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may have been out of this atmosphere that there was formed a tradition which, going underground for centuries and suffering transformations in the process, appeared in the Middle Ages as the ''Ars Notoria'', a magical art of memory attributed to Apollonius or sometimes to Solomon. The practitioner of the ''Ars Notoria'' gazed at figures or diagrams curiously marked and called 'notae' whilst reciting magical prayers. He hoped to gain in this way knowledge, or memory, of all the arts and sciences, a different 'nota' being provided for each discipline. The ''Ars Notoria'' is perhaps a descendant of the classical art of memory, or of that difficult branch of it which used the shorthand ''notae''. It was regarded as a particularly black kind of magic and was severely condemned by Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Textual mnemonic===
Carruthers's studies of memory suggest that the images and pictures employed in the medieval arts of memory were not representational in the sense we today understand that term. Rather, images were understood to function "textually", as a type of 'writing', and not as something different from it in kind.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_222"&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

If such an assessment is correct, it suggests that the use of text to recollect memories was, for medieval practitioners, merely a variant of techniques employing ''notae'', images and other non-textual devices. Carruthers quotes [[Pope Gregory I]], in support of the idea that 'reading' pictures was considered to be a variation of reading itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is one thing to worship a picture, it is another by means of pictures to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see what they ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_222"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her work makes clear that for medieval readers the act of reading itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and appears to have been the exception rather than the rule), then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own. She asserts that both 'textual' activities (picturing and reading) have as their goal the internalization of knowledge and experience in memory.

The use of manuscript illuminations to reinforce the memory of a particular textual passage, the use of visual alphabets such as those in which birds or tools represent letters, the use of illuminated capital letters at the openings of passages, and even the structure of the modern book (itself deriving from scholastic developments) with its index, table of contents and chapters reflect the fact that reading was a memorial practice, and the use of text was simply another technique in the arsenal of practitioners of the arts of memory.

==Method of loci==
{{Main|Method of loci}}

The 'method of loci' (plural of Latin ''locus'' for place or location) is a general designation for mnemonic techniques that rely upon memorized spatial relationships to establish, order and recollect memorial content. The term is most often found in specialized works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]] and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on Rhetoric, Logic and [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe and Nadel refer to "'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by Yates (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or a video game,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2987335/Building_a_memory_palace_in_minutes_Equivalent_memory_performance_using_virtual_versus_conventional_environments_with_the_Method_of_Loci Building a memory palace in minutes: Equivalent memory performance using virtual versus conventional environments with the Method of Loci]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Artificial_Memory_Palaces Artificial memory palaces]&lt;/ref&gt; or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Palace#Get_more_memory_palaces_or_journeys Getting more memory palace locations]&lt;/ref&gt; When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any distinguishing feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use."&lt;ref&gt;John O'Keefe &amp; Lynn Nadel, ''The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'', Oxford University Press, 1978, p389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the art of memory, the origins of which are related, according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]]: and the collapsing banquet hall discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Steven M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC"&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from Frances Yates) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the art of memory. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon A. Gutman, ''Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals'', SLACK Incorporated, 2001, p216&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the art of memory, hastily glossed in some of the works just cited, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plant morphology buds axillary.png|alt=The axillary buds are highlighted in yellow.|thumb|Axillary buds are located at the intersection of the leaf and stem of a plant.]]The '''axillary bud''' (or '''lateral bud''') is an [[Plant embryogenesis|embryonic]] [[shoot]] located in the [[axil]] of a [[leaf]]. Each [[bud]] has the potential to form shoots, and may be specialized in producing either vegetative shoots (stems and branches) or reproductive shoots ([[flower]]s). Once formed, a bud may remain dormant for some time, or it may form a shoot immediately.&lt;ref name="BellBryan2008pg306"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adrian D. Bell|author2=Alan Bryan|title=Plant Form: An Illustrated Guide to Flowering Plant Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM3khPHXhKEC&amp;pg=PA306|year=2008|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-850-1|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
An axillary bud is an embryonic [[shoot]] which lies dormant at the junction of the [[plant stem|stem]] and [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] of a [[plant]].&lt;ref name="BellBryan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adrian D. Bell|author2=Alan Bryan|title=Plant Form: An Illustrated Guide to Flowering Plant Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM3khPHXhKEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2008|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-850-1|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arises exogenously from outer layer of [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the stem.

Axillary buds do not become actively growing shoots on plants with strong [[apical dominance]] (the tendency to grow just the terminal bud on the main stem). Apical dominance occurs because the shoot [[apical meristem]] produces auxin which prevents axillary buds from growing. The axillary buds begin developing when they are exposed to less auxin, for example if the plant naturally has weak apical dominance, if apical dominance is broken by removing the terminal bud, or if the terminal bud has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect.&lt;ref name="Berg2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Berg|title=Introductory Botany: Plants, People, and the Environment, Media Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I71WWH9ZmfsC&amp;pg=PA238|date=23 March 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-534-46669-9|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axillary buds can be used to differentiate if the plant is single-leafed or multi-leafed. Simply count the number of leaves after an axillary bud. If there is only one leaf, then the plant is considered single-leafed, if not it is considered multi-leafed. [[File:Searsia angustifolia (Rhus angustifolia) axillary buds 5540.jpg|thumb|Example of an axillary bud. Axillary buds have the potential to form new shoots and become branches or flowers.|left]] An example of axillary buds are the eyes of the potato. [[File:Axillary-buds.jpg|thumb|Axillary buds only develop if they're not exposed to high levels of auxin from the terminal bud.]]

=== Effects of auxin ===
As the apical meristem grows and forms [[leaves]], it leaves behind a region of meristematic cells at the node between the stem and the leaf. These axillary buds are usually dormant, inhibited by [[auxin]] produced by the apical meristem, which is known as [[apical dominance]].

If the apical meristem is removed, or has grown a sufficient distance away from an axillary bud, the axillary bud may become activated (or more appropriately freed from [[hormone]] inhibition). Like the apical meristem, axillary buds can develop into a stem or flower.

=== Diseases that affect axillary buds ===
Certain [[plant pathology|plant diseases]] - notably [[phytoplasma]]s - can cause the proliferation of axillary buds, and cause plants to become bushy in appearance.

{{Bible-related}}

'''Biblical literalist chronology''' is the attempt to correlate the theological dates used in the Bible with the real chronology of actual events.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The Bible measures time from the date of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] (years are measured as [[anno mundi]], or AM, meaning Year of the World), but there is no agreement on when this was, some of the better-known alternatives including Archbishop [[Ussher chronology|James Ussher]], who placed it in 4004 BCE, [[Isaac Newton]] in 4000 BCE, [[Martin Luther]] in 3961 BCE, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the [[Septuagint]], of 5009 BCE.{{sfn|Day|2014|p=3-4}} To the foundation of the Temple of Solomon the passage of time is measured by simple addition of from the Creation; for later periods it measures time by the reigns of kings, but the data is conflicting and there is no agreement on how to resolve the problems.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}} 

== Background ==
The Jewish Bible (the Christian [[Old Testament]]) dates events either by simple arithmetic taking the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] as the starting point, or, in the later books, by correlations between the reigns of kings in Israel and Judah.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The data it provides falls into three periods:{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96-97}}
# From the Creation to Abraham's migration to Canaan, during which events are dated by adding the ages of the patriarchs;
# From Abraham's migration to the foundation of Solomon's temple, in which the chronology in Genesis continues to be arrived at by adding ages, but from Exodus on is usually given in statements;
# From the foundation of the temple onward, which gives the reigns in years (sometimes shorter periods) of kings in Israel and Judah.
 
For the biblical authors the chronology was theological in intent, functioning as prophecy and not as history.{{sfn|Christensen|1990|p=148}}{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=73-74}} [[Biblical literalism]], however, does not treat it this way, because literalists have a profound respect for the Bible as the word of God.{{sfn|Olson|2011|p=22}} This way of thinking had its origins in [[Christian fundamentalism]], an early 20th century movement which opposed then-current non-supernatural interpretations of the life of Jesus by stressing, among other things, the verbal inspiration of scripture.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}} The underlying concept, or fear, was that if everything in the Bible were not true, everything would collapse.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}}

==Literalist chronologies==
The creation of a literalist chronology of the Bible faces several hurdles, of which the following are the most significant:
* There are different texts of the Jewish Bible, the major text-families being: the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the original Hebrew scriptures made in the last few centuries before Christ; the [[Masoretic text]], a version of the Hebrew text curated by the Jewish rabbis but the earliest manuscripts of which date from the early years of the 2nd millennium CE; and the Samaritan text, restricted to the five books of the Torah plus the Book of Joshua. The three differ quite markedly from each other.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=1}}
* Literalists prefer the Masoretic text, on which Protestant Bibles are based, but the Masoretic text sometimes contains absurdities, as when it states that Saul came to the throne at the age of one and reigned for two years. Such obvious errors can be corrected by reference to other versions of the Bible (in this case the Septuagint, which gives more realistic numbers), but their existence calls into question the fundamentalist idea that the MT text is the inspired word of God.{{sfn|Vriezen|van der Woude|2005|p=98}} Most fundamentalists, with the notable exception of the [[King James Only]] movement, avoid this by holding that only the authors of the original autographs (the very first copies written by [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]] and others) were inspired by God.{{sfn|Whelan|2012|p=unpaginated}}
* The Bible is not always consistent.{{sfn|Greenspahn|2016|p=380}} For example, Exodus 12:30 states that the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt, while Paul in the New Testament says the 430 years covers the period from Abraham to Moses.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}}
* The earlier part of the Bible's history contradicts science and known history (the world is not 6,000 years old as the Biblical chronology suggests, the ages of the patriarchs in Genesis are far longer than is reasonable, and serious historians of Israel's history no longer regard the exodus, the conquest of Canaan, or the entire period prior to David as real history).
* Very few events in the Bible are mentioned in outside sources, making it difficult to move from a relative chronology (X happened before Y happened) to an absolute one (X happened in a known year).

==Tables==
The Bible measures events from the year of God's creation of the world, a type of calendar called [[Anno Mundi]] ("Year of the World"), shortened as AM. The task of a literal biblical chronology is to convert this to dates in the modern chronology expressed as years before or after Christ, BC and AD. There have been many attempts to do this, none of them universally accepted. The following tables (derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past''; notes within the table as cited) divide the Bible's AM dates by the three periods into which they most naturally fall.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}}

| style="text-align:left;"|From Creation to the birth of Abraham time is calculated by adding the ages of the Patriarchs when their first child is born.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|p=124}} It seems possible that the period of the Flood is not meant to be included in the count – Shem, born 100 years before the Flood, "begot" his first son two years after it, which should make him 102, but Genesis 11:10-11 specifies that he is only 100, suggesting that time has been suspended.{{sfn|Guillaume|2007|p=6,252-253}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A literal chronology would put the creation of the world about 4000 BCE and the Flood about 2300 BCE.{{sfn|Matthews|1996|p=302fn18}} The best-known attempt to provide a date for Creation is probably that of Archbishop [[Ussher chronology|James Ussher]], who placed it 4004 BCE, but there are many alternatives, including [[Isaac Newton]] in 4000 BCE, [[Martin Luther]] in 3961 BCE, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the Septuagint, of 5009 BCE.{{sfn|Day|2014|p=3-4}} The dates given to subsequent events such as the Flood will depend on this initial date.

| style="text-align:left;"|Entrance into Egypt&lt;br&gt;Exodus&lt;br&gt;Foundation of Solomon's Temple
| style="text-align:left;"|The 215 years between Abraham's call to enter Canaan (AM 2021) and Jacob's entry into Egypt (AM 2236) are calculated from the ages of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob provided in Genesis; the 430 year period in Egypt is stated in Exodus 12:40, although [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in the New Testament says that the 430 years covers the entire period from Abraham to the exodus.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The Exodus (AM 2666) occurs exactly two-thirds of the way through the 4,000 years from the Creation to the rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE, marking it as the pivotal event of the chronology.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}} It is also two-thirds of the way through the 40 notional "generations" of 100 years each making up the 4,000 years, with Aaron, the first High Priest, being the 26th generation from Adam.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}&lt;br&gt;
A literal reading of the Biblical chronology would place the Exodus about 1446 BCE, on the basis of the statement in 1 Kings 6:1 that the Temple was founded 480 years after the Exodus.{{sfn|Reed|2011|p=107}} From this a literal chronology can deduce dates for the entry into Canaan 40 years later and the birth of Moses 80 years earlier. It seems impossible, however, to reconcile the 430 years in Egypt with the Bible's information (Exodus 12:40) that this involved only four generations.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=28}}

| The period from the foundation of the Temple to its destruction, 430 years, is found by adding the reigns of the kings of Judah from the fourth year of Solomon (the year of the Temple's foundation).{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The fourth year of Solomon came exactly 1,200 years after the birth of Abraham (Abraham was born in AM 1946 if the two years of the Flood are excluded),{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=30}} and there were exactly 20 kings in both Judah and Israel following Solomon, despite Judah lasting more than a century longer than Israel.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=26-27}} The complete chronology seems to point towards the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE bringing the chronology to AM 4000, from which the entire cycle is calculated backwards.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2006|p=87}}&lt;br&gt;

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|p=95-96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]] can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}} Possibly the most widely followed attempt to resolve the problems is [[Edwin R. Thiele]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} Subsequent scholars continue to propose alternative chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}&lt;br&gt;

== Example of literalist chronology ==

The following tabulation of years and dates is according to the literal letter of the text of the Bible alone. Links to multiple translations and versions are provided for verification. For comparison, known historically dated events are associated with the resultant literal dates. Dates according to the famous [[Ussher chronology]] appear in small type italics "''{{small|A.M.}}''" (Latin: "''Year of the World''"), "''{{small|Ante C.}}''" (Latin: "''Before Christ''"). In ancient Israel a part year was designated as the previous king's last year and the new king's 1st year. The arithmetic can be checked by starting at the bottom of the table with the date of the destruction of the Temple in 587 and adding the number of years in the Scriptures (books of the ''Prophets'' and ''Chronicles'' through ''Genesis'') back up to the beginning. Dates with ''events in italics'' appearing in ''{{small|small type}}'' for historical comparison are according to Bernard Grun's ''The Timetables of History''. For the period after 587 BCE known historical dates are used as referents. Biblical source texts for stated numbers of years are referenced and linked. Reference sources are the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSVCE]],&lt;ref&gt;''Revised Standard Version'', © 1966 Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, published by Thomas Nelson Publishers for Ignatius Press, {{ISBN|0-89870-490-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Saint Joseph Edition of The New American Bible | publisher = [[Catholic Book Publishing|Catholic Book Publishing Co.]], New York, N.Y. | year = 1987, 1980, 1970 by the [[Confraternity of Christian Doctrine]], Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Timetables of History'' by [[Bernard Grun]], and the ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'' (2003).

|The [[Book of Joshua|conquest of Canaan]], a period of 32 (?) years, beginning with [[Jericho]] (1536). &lt;br/&gt; The Bible does not state the number of the years of the conquest of Canaan during the lifetime of Joshua, only that Joshua was 110 years old when he died.
*''See'' [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] &lt;br/&gt; [[John Garstang]] and [[Kathleen Kenyon]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to [[carbon-dating]], Jericho (Jericho City IV) was destroyed between 1617 and 1530 BCE. The site remained uninhabited (Joshua's curse ? {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|6:26}}) until the city was refounded in the 9th century BCE. John Garstang determined that Jericho was destroyed by fire around 1400 BCE, corresponding to the biblical dating of the Israelite conquest current at that time. Kathleen Kenyon's findings disagreed with Garstang and the accepted biblical dating, and she dated the destruction and the city wall to a much earlier time, in the 1600–1500s, c. 1550. But she believed that the Exodus and the conquest under Joshua took place in the 1200s and declared that, since the city had already been long uninhabited through the entire 13th century, it was impossible that Jericho had been destroyed by Joshua according to the biblical account. "While critical scholars underline the conflict between archaeological data and the biblical conquest narrative, in reality there is no conflict here."—Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell. &lt;br/&gt; —''Source'': "Jericho", Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 885–888. &lt;br/&gt; Israeli-Canadian journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]]  (''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'', 2006) pointed out that if researchers of the future insisted that the American Civil War took place at the time of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States in the 1960s at the time of the Vietnam War, and then looked for evidence supporting occurrence of the Civil War at that time, they would find none, and the presidency of Abraham Lincoln would be regarded as only legendary. If chronological dating provided by a more literal reading of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' were taken seriously, then concrete archaeological evidence for the historical accuracy of the biblical text would become more evident: "It's staring them in the face, and they don't recognize it."&lt;/ref&gt;

*A plain, explicit meaning for the exact period of "''the days of the elders''" and of the "''generation after them''" cannot be drawn from the text of the Bible alone; the Bible text does not explicitly state the number of days of that generation. &lt;br/&gt; The "''300 years''" of Judges 11:26 is not useful here in determining the period of that generation and does not correspond to the literal numbering of the years stated plainly in all the chronological texts of the Bible tabulated from David back to Joshua, from ''2 Samuel'' through ''Joshua'' (Jephthah 1186 BCE back to Cushan-Rishathaim 1505 BCE: 1505–1186 BCE = 319 years). &lt;br/&gt; The "''450 years''" of Acts 13:19-20 for the period of the judges exactly corresponds to the literal tabulation of the years in this table, from 1505 BCE, after Joshua, to 1055 BCE, when David began to rule over all Israel and Judah (1505 – 1055 = 450), but it does not correspond to the literal tabulation of the years of the "''judges until Samuel the prophet''" 1115/1075 BCE. (1505–1115 BCE = 390 years, and 1505–1075 BCE = 430 years.) This text too is not useful in determining the number of days and length of years of the 2 generations after Joshua.

Though there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}), William F.

*The specific identities of this particular Ptolemy and his co-regent Cleopatra together with the period of their reign cannot be drawn from the Bible. Two dates have been proposed for the 4th year of the reign of the otherwise unspecified Ptolemy and Cleopatra. The [[New American Bible]] annotation suggests that Ptolemy refers to [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] and Cleopatra to [[Cleopatra V Tryphaena]], and the date referred to as 78–77 B.C. during their reign; the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] (1899 American edition) suggests in its footnote annotation to Esther 11:1 "Ante C. 177" (177 BC). This date falls within the reign of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]], who ruled jointly with his mother, [[Cleopatra I Syra]], until her death in 176 BC.

"''between the sea and the glorious holy mountain...he shall come to his end with none to help him.''"—"''...among the mountains in a strange land.''" A majority of Biblical scholars maintain that Daniel wrongly prophesied that Antiochus would die in Palestine.]]Daniel's prophesy of the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes "''among the mountains in a strange land''" ({{bibleverse|2|Maccabees|9:28|63}}; {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45|ESV}}) is [[Controversy|controverted]]. Daniel 11:45 does not specify which "''sea''". Some students of the Bible [{{small|source: "Daniel", S. Miller, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary''}}] identify Antiochus literally with Daniel 11:21-44, which accords with the description of his policies and actions in 1 and 2 Maccabees. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16 and 2 Maccabees 9:1-16, 28 shows that Antiochus died travelling on the [[Silk Road|great east-west highway]] running through Persia, northeast of Judea and [[Mount Zion]] and southwest of the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the mountainous Zagros region of Persia between [[Ecbatana]] and Babylon. It is evident that he did not die in Palestine between Mount Zion and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Traditionally, "''the sea''" and "''the great sea''" in the Bible is the Mediterranean ({{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|9:1|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:12|ESV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:47|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|23:4|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:11|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|25:19-22|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:19|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:2-3|ESV}}; compare {{bibleverse||Joel|2:20|ESV}} "''eastern sea''" and "''western sea''", and {{bibleverse||Micah|7:12|ESV}} "''from sea to sea''"). This is the understanding of a majority of Old Testament Biblical scholars such as [[Choon-Leong Seow|C. L. Seow]] [{{small|''Daniel'', 2003, [[Westminster John Knox Press]], Louisville, Kentucky, ISBN 978-0-664-25675-3}}], and [[John J. Collins]], Peter W. Flint, and others [{{small|''[http://www.brill.com/book-daniel-volume-1-composition-and-reception The Book of Daniel: Volume 1 Composition and Reception]'', 2000, BRILL, ISBN 978-90-04-11675-7}}] who hold that Daniel 11:45 refers to the mountains of Judea between Mount Zion and the Mediterranean Sea, or more specifically to Mount Zion, and conclude that the prophesy that Antiochus would die in Palestine "is totally inaccurate" since he died in Persia. Bible translations of this passage differ: some have Antiochus pitching his pavilion "''between the seas''", others have it "''on the glorious holy mountain''", while others more literally have it "''between the glorious holy mountain and the sea''" (see variant translations at {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45}}). The conclusion of most Old Testament scholars is that the account in Daniel 11 is completely accurate through verse 44, but wrong in verse 45, and therefore it must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem. But this scholarly reading of "''the sea''" as the Mediterranean, and those translations having Antiochus' pavilion "''on/in the glorious holy mountain (Zion)''" in Palestine, are simply dismissed as wrong by a literalist plain reading of the Biblical text ([[Context (language use)|context]]) as it relates to the death of Antiochus among the mountains of Persia "''in a strange land''" between the Caspian Sea and Mount Zion. —''Sources'': &lt;br/&gt; "Mediterranean Sea", Philip Lee, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 1097–1098. &lt;br/&gt;"Daniel, book of", Stephen R.

*2 Maccabees 1:13-16 relates the death of [[Antiochus X Eusebes]] and his men, during the course of a military expedition, as locked inside the temple of [[Nanaya|Nanea]] in Persia, stoned to death and beheaded by the priests.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Mahlon H. Smith]] states that Antiochus X Eusebes died fighting the [[Parthian Empire]] (which included Persian territory). See [http://virtualreligion.net/iho/antiochus_10.html Antiochus X Eusebes: ''Mahlon H. Smith''].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{small|This Antiochus should not be confused with the earlier Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who failed to take Elymais and its temple, and afterward died of parasitic infection and decay in the mountains of Persia. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16; 2 Maccabees 9:1-10, 28.}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some scholars (''The New American Bible'' for example) believe that the ''Antiochus'' referred to in this text of 2 Macc. 1:14 was Antiochus IV Epiphanes: "'''''1, 14-17''': A different account of the death of Antiochus IV is given in 2 Mc 9, 1-29 and another variant account in 1 Mc 6, 1-16. The writer of this letter'' [2 Macc. 1:10–2:18 one copy to Aristobulus in Jerusalem, one copy to the Jews in Egypt] ''probably heard a distorted rumor of the king's death. This fact and other indications show that the letter was written very soon after Antiochus IV died, hence in 164 B.C.'' —New American Bible, 2 Maccabees 1:14–17, footnote. &lt;br/&gt; As with the text of Daniel 11:45, a literalist interpretation of 2 Maccabees rejects the scholarly view of a "''distorted rumor''" in favor of an "inerrant" reading that takes the narrative as an accurate report, and therefore as not referring to the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, but to the actual death of another Antiochus who was slain by Parthians in the (Syrian) region of [[Parthian Empire#Rome and Armenia|Persia/the Parthian Empire]] in the temple of Nanaya. The extra-biblical evidence cited by Mahlon H. Smith and others regarding the circumstances of the death of Antiochus X tends to support this literalist view, but this is currently a minority opinion.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Breeding back''' is a form of [[artificial selection]] by the deliberate [[selective breeding]] of [[domestication|domestic]] animals, in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a [[phenotype]] that resembles a [[wildtype]] ancestor, usually one that is [[extinction|extinct]] in its wild form. Breeding back is not to be confused with [[dedomestication]].

It must be kept in mind that a breeding-back breed may be very similar to the extinct wild type in phenotype, ecological niche, and to some extent genetics, but the initial [[gene pool]] of that wild type is lost forever with its [[extinction]]. It is not truly possible for a breeding back attempt to actually recreate an extinct wild type that is the breeding target, as an extinct wild type cannot be resurrected via selective breeding alone. Furthermore, even the outward authenticity of a bred-back type depends on the quality of the stock used as the foundation of the project. As a result, some breeds, like [[Heck cattle]], are at best a vague look-alike of the extinct wildtype [[aurochs]], according to the literature.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"&gt;Cis van Vuure: Retracing the Aurochs – History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. 2005. {{ISBN|954-642-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Rebuilding a Species.ogv|thumb|left|[[VOA]] report about the Quagga Project]]
It is the target of breeding back to restore the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage. Commonly, not only the phenotype but also the ecological capacity are considered in breeding back projects, because hardy breeding back results are used in certain [[Conservation movement|conservation]] projects. In nature, usually only individuals suited to the natural circumstances can survive and reproduce, while humans select those with additional attractive, docile or productive characteristics. Therefore, selection criteria in nature versus those in domestic conditions are different and domesticated animals often differ significantly in [[phenotype]], behaviour and [[genetics]] from their wild forerunners. It is the target of breeding back to re-create the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage.

In many cases, the extinct wild type ancestors of a given species are known only through skeletons and, in some cases, historical descriptions, so their phenotype is not directly accessible. Therefore, there is no certainty of success with a breeding back attempt and the results must be reviewed with caution. In order to test genetic closeness, both [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[nuclear DNA]] have to be accessible. However, success is possible: humans selected only for superficial characters and as a rule did not change inner mechanisms such as digestion.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  Further, since many domestic animals show a behaviour that is derived from their wild ancestors (such as the herding instinct of [[cattle]] or the social instincts of [[dog]]s), and are fit to survive under natural circumstances, as evidenced by the many [[feral]] populations of many domestic animals, it can be presumed that back-bred animals will function like their wild ancestors.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  For example, food choice should be the same in domestic and wild types. [[Natural selection]] could serve as an additional tool in creating authentic robustness, behaviour and maybe also phenotype. For large herbivores, a sufficient predator population would also be necessary to support such a process, but this predator population is largely not present in today's [[Europe]], where many breeding back projects are conducted.

There is a difference between creating a look-alike breed from domestic animals and creating a look-alike via artificial selection of individuals of a different species or subspecies that may resemble the animal that is targeted. 

For example, the [[Quagga Project]] is trying to breed animals which strongly resemble the original [[Quagga]] of South Africa.  The quagga was a subspecies of the [[plains zebra]] and has no descendants.  Accordingly, the Project is limited to selecting for the physical appearance of the original, as illustrated by twenty three mounted specimens, contemporary paintings and written accounts.    

However, the two most noticeable characteristics of the quagga, fewer stripes and darker pelage, are frequently observed to varying degrees in wild plains zebra populations.  Animals with these characteristic are included in the Quagga Project breeding programme.  

After nearly thirty years of selective breeding, to concentrate these characteristics, recent foals show a marked resemblance to the original.

== Use ==

Bred-back breeds are interesting for [[conservation biology]] since they may fill an ecological gap that has been left due to the extinction of the wildtypes due to hunting by humans. As long as food choice, behaviour, robustness, defence against predators, hunting or foraging instincts and phenotype are the same as in the wild type, it will function like it in the wilderness. Releasing such animals into the wild would fill the previously empty niche and allows a natural dynamic between the species of the ecosystem to re-evolve. However, breeding-back attempts do not always result in an animal that is closer to the wild type than other domestic breeds. For example, Heck cattle bear less resemblance to the aurochs than many Iberian fighting cattle do.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;

== Examples==

=== Aurochs ===
Ideas for creating an [[aurochs]]-like animal from domestic cattle have been around since 1835. In the 1920s, [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]] tried to breed a look-alike using central European dairy breeds and southern European cattle. The result, Heck cattle, are hardy, but differ from the aurochs in many respects, although a resemblance in colour and sometimes also horns has been achieved.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt; From 1996 onwards, Heck cattle have been crossed with primitive Iberian breeds like [[Sayaguesa Cattle]] and Fighting cattle, and the very large Italian breed [[Chianina]] in a number of German reserves in order to enhance the resemblance to the aurochs. The results are called [[Taurus cattle]], which are larger and more long-legged than Heck cattle and have a more aurochs-like horn shape. Another project to achieve a type of cattle that resembles the aurochs is [[TaurOs Project]], using primitive and hardy southern European breeds and also Scottish [[Highland cattle]]. These Tauros cattle are planned to be established in various European natural reserves.

=== European wild horse ===
The Polish [[Konik]] horse is often erroneously considered the result of a breeding-back experiment to "recreate" the [[phenotype]] of the [[Tarpan]], the European [[wild horse]]. The Konik is actually a hardy [[landrace]] breed originating in Poland which was called ''Panje horse'' before agriculturist [[Tadeusz Vetulani]] coined the name "Konik" in the 1920s. Vetulani did start an experiment trying to reconstruct the Tarpan using Koniks, but his stock only had a minor contribution to the modern Konik population.&lt;ref name="DPK"&gt;Tadeusz Jezierski, Zbigniew Jaworski: ''Das Polnische Konik. Die Neue Brehm-Bücherei Bd. 658'', Westarp Wissenschaften, Hohenwarsleben 2008, {{ISBN|3-89432-913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during World War II, the Heck brothers crossed Koniks with [[Przewalski's horse]]s and also other ponies like [[Icelandic horse]]s and [[Gotland pony|Gotland ponies]]; the result is now called the [[Heck Horse]]. During the last decades, Heck horses have continuously been crossed with Koniks, so that their phenotype now is nearly indistinguishable, except that the Heck horse has a slenderer build on average.&lt;ref name="Weiden"&gt;Bunzel-Drüke, Finck, Kämmer, Luick, Reisinger, Riecken, Riedl, Scharf &amp; Zimball: ''"Wilde Weiden: Praxisleitfaden für Ganzjahresbeweidung in Naturschutz und Landschaftsentwicklung''&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Konik-type horses, the [[Exmoor Pony]] that still lives in a [[semi-feral]] state in some parts of Southern England has also been claimed to be closer to the European wild horse as it carries [[pangare]] coloration and has a resemblance to the horses in [[Lascaux]] [[cave paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurowildlife.org/news/wild-horses-for-europe–-which-breed-is-the-best/ ''European Wildlife'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wolf ===
[[File:Tamaskan.jpg|thumb|A [[Tamaskan Dog]], bred to visually resemble a wolf.]]
Although the [[wolf]], the wild ancestor of domestic dogs, is not extinct, its phenotype is the target of several developmental breeds including the [[Northern Inuit Dog]] and the [[Tamaskan Dog]]. They are all crossbreeds of [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Alaskan Malamutes]] and [[husky|huskies]], selected for phenotypic wolf characteristics. Therefore, these breeds are breeding-back attempts as well.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gamborg et al: ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00005 De-Domestication: Ethics at the Intersection of Landscape Restoration and Animal Welfare] In: ''Environmental Values'' 2010, 19(1):57-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Although extinct, [[Japanese wolf]] DNA survives in the modern domestic [[Shikoku Inu]]. It is thought that crossing this breed with some subspecies of [[Asian Wolf]] would result in a authentic analogue to fill the ecological niche left by the absence of the apex predator.

The Dire Wolf Project, started in 1988, concerns the [[dire wolf]], an extinct prehistoric wolf, and aims to bring it back by breeding different dog breeds that resemble it.

'''East China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''ECUPL'''; {{zh|s=华东政法大学|p=Huádōng Zhèngfǎ Dàxué}}) is a [[public university]] in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China]], founded in 1952.

==History==
[[File:Thumb-2.jpeg|thumb|Library building at the [[Songjiang University Town|Songjiang Campus]] of ECUPL]]
The urban campus is located on the campus of the former [[St. John's University, Shanghai|St. John's University]]. The new campus that houses the undergraduate students is located in the [[Songjiang University Town]] adjacent to the six universities [[Shanghai International Studies University]]; [[Donghua University]]; [[Shanghai Institute of Foreign Trade]]; [[Shanghai University of Engineering Sciences]]; [[Shanghai Lixin University of Commerce]] and [[Shanghai Institute of Visual Art]].

ECUPL is one of the few higher education institutions in China specializing in legal education. In the field of legal education, ECUPL enjoys unparalleled influence and prestige in Shanghai and greater East China, which is China's most developed geographical division. ECUPL's alumni are found in virtually every legal profession and institution in East China, such as law firms, governmental agencies, courts, and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecupl.edu.cn/en/introdution/intro.htm Introduction to ECUPL]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1952, ECUPL is one of the first group of higher learning institutions of politics and law established by the People's Republic of China and it used to be one of the higher learning institutions of the Ministry of Justice of PRC. It is now a university jointly administered by the Ministry of Justice and local government, with the local government enjoying the priority of administration. Through the efforts of several generations, ECUPL has gradually developed into a multidisciplinary university of economics, management, finance, foreign languages, etc. with focus on law.

ECUPL now has campuses in two districts: Changning and Songjiang, covering an area of 1,064 mu (161.5 acres or 65.37 hectare) and a total building area of 240,000 square meters. At present, ECUPL has four LLD programs, i.e. legal historiography, criminal jurisprudence, economic jurisprudence, and international law, and nine LLM programs of law, i.e. theories of law, legal historiography, constitutional jurisprudence and administrative jurisprudence, criminal jurisprudence, civil and commercial jurisprudence, procedural law, economic jurisprudence，international jurisprudence, environment and resources protection jurisprudence and one LLM program of professional law and on-the-job students are accepted to pursue doctor and master's degrees. ECUPL has 22 majors for bachelors, i.e. law, economics reconnaissance study, finance, administration, English, Japanese, international business and trade, sociology, public security labour and social security, frontier defence management, politics and administration, journalism, public affairs administration, accounting and intellectual property, information science and technology, business administration, cultural industry management, Chinese literature, social work, among which the law major offers undergraduate programs intended for a second bachelor's degree in law.

International economic law and history of law are the key subjects assigned by the Ministry of Justice, and the subject of law is the key subject by the local government. The university has four journals, named, Law, Studies of Crime, Issues of Juvenile delinquency, and the Journal of East China University of Political Science and Law. It also has more than 30 research institutions, studying ancient Chinese legal documents, juvenile delinquency and so on. The library in the university has a collection of books more than 600,000 volumes and has over 1,200 Chinese and foreign journals and magazines. ECUPL has established cooperative relationship with more than 100 overseas colleges and universities, research institutions and legal institutions in the country. There are about 800 faculty members, among whom more than 400 are teaching and research staff and more than 160 are professors or associate professors, and over 10,000 students. It is also a Shanghai Model Unit and Shanghai Garden Unit and its architecture on campus receives special protection from the government.
 
For the last fifty years, ECUPL has adhered to the party's policies on education, struck to the principle of "Behave sincerely and learn thirstily; revere virtues and respect laws." It bases herself in Shanghai, faces east China and radiates the whole nation and has gradually developed into a higher learning institution with abundant teaching staff, distinct   
operating features, high teaching quality, advanced academic level, outstanding academic achievements, frequent operations and exchanges and beautiful campus. ECUPL has become an "oriental pearl in the law education", which makes a great contribution to the socialistic legal construction and modernization construction by bringing up more than 40,000 high-level talents of law for the party and the country.

In December 2013 the school attracted international headlines on news that lecturer [[Zhang Xuezhong (academic)|Zhang Xuezhong]] had been expelled.  Prior to his dismissal Zhang had provided legal counsel to the [[New Citizens' Movement (China)|New Citizens' Movement]] and, according to state-controlled media, expressed "political opinions that go against the law."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Jacobs (journalist)|Andrew Jacobs]] (10 December 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/asia/chinese-professor-who-advocated-free-speech-is-fired.html Chinese Professor Who Advocated Free Speech Is Fired] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Phillips (10 December 2013), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10507646/Fresh-fears-of-crackdown-as-Chinese-professor-is-fired-for-criticising-Xi-Jinping.html Fresh fears of crackdown as Chinese professor is fired for 'criticising Xi Jinping'] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu Sha (10 December 2013), [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/831398.shtml Vocal law professor fails to renew contract with university] ''[[Global Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Cooperation and Exchange==
East China University of Political Science and Law (ECUPL) is always paying much attention to the cooperative exchanges with overseas universities or higher institutions. It has set up joint program with the National University of Singapore and the City University of Hong Kong. Also, it receives students groups annually from the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecupl.edu.cn/en/cooperation/cooper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Currently, it has signed cooperation agreements with around 35 overseas universities, including Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio in the United States, Wisconsin University of the United States, Willammette University of the United States,Golden Gate University of the United States, Ghent University of Ghent, Vrije University of the Netherlands, Groningen University of the Netherlands, Queensland University of Australia, Bond University of Australia, Kyushu University of Japan, Kumamoto University of Japan, Anshan University of South Korea and so on. Every year, it selects and sends excellent faculty members and students to sister universities for further study and research. Also it encourages graduate and first-year postgraduate students to pursue the LLM degree in overseas universities. At the same time, the East China University of Political Science and Law also maintains good relationships with well-known law firms in Shanghai and world-renowned companies.

He became again acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] from 23 February 2010 until 14 October 2010 following the resignation of [[Guusje Ter Horst]].

After the [[Dutch general election, 2010|Dutch general election of 2010]], he made an appeal to his party not to work with [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) to begin a [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]] for a new cabinet. After the success of the formation he was not offered a new position in the new [[First Rutte cabinet|Cabinet Rutte]], and returned as a [[Professor]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Tilburg University]] as a legal scholar.

Hirsch Ballin is also an active member of the Justice Leadership Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justiceleaders.org/leaders/ernst-hirsch-ballin/|title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin - Justice Leadership|publisher=justiceleaders.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hirsch Ballin was born to a [[Jewish]] father Prof. Dr. Ernst Danny Hirsch Ballin, and a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] mother. After completing his secondary education, he studied law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and became a practicing [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

He graduated in 1974, and he received a [[Master of Laws]] degree. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1979 for his dissertation on public law and policy, which focussed on fundamental issues surrounding the work of the Advisory Council on Government Policy (WRR).

Hirsch Ballin was a research assistant in constitutional law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] from 1974 to 1977. He was subsequently employed as a legal officer at the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Ministry of Justice]]. In 1981 he was appointed [[professor]] of constitutional and administrative law at [[Tilburg University]].

===Politics===
[[Image:Ernst Hirsch Ballin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Hirsch Ballin in 2009.]]

From 7 November 1989 to 27 May 1994 Hirsch Ballin served as [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs]] in the [[Netherlands cabinet Lubbers-3|Cabinet Lubbers III]]. In 1994 he offered his resignation, after turmoil about the Dutch Criminal Investigation Department.

After the [[Netherlands cabinet Kok-1|Cabinet Kok I]] with a coalition of the [[Dutch Labour Party]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Democrats 66]] came to power the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] was pushed to the opposition and Hirsch Ballin became a [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Member of the House of Representatives]] a post he held until 1995.

During this period he was also [[professor]] of legislative issues at the [[Tilburg University]]. In 1995 he was appointed [[professor]] of [[international law]] at the same university and later became [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/6715 |title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Hirsch Ballin was appointed to the [[Dutch Council of State]] and he resigned as a [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]].

Hirsch Ballin has held numerous other positions, among them government commissioner for the review of legislation, member of the Board of the [[Netherlands Atlantic Association]], member of Committee 2004 (for the relationship between the [[Netherlands]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]) and deputy justice on the Central Appeals Tribunal and the ''Administrative Court for Trade and Industry''. He has been editor of the Dutch administrative law journal "Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Bestuursrecht" and the book series European and [[International Law]].

On 23 May 2008 satirical cartoonist [[Gregorius Nekschot]] was arrested which caused (inter)national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2008/05_mei/15/binnenland/0515_2315_gregorius_nekschot_cartoonist_opgepakt.xml/ Cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot opgepakt], [[RTL Nederland|RTL Nieuws]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsch Ballin wanted to pass a bill on blasphemy, but failed. He was accused of causing the cartoonist to be brought to court for blasphemy to get a verdict to bypass the parliament.

===Family===
Ernst Hirsch Ballin is married; he and his wife have two children.

A '''European Study Group with Industry (ESGI)''' is usually a week-long meeting where applied mathematicians work on problems presented by industry and research centres. The aim of the meeting is to solve or at least make progress on the problems.

The study group concept originated in Oxford, in 1968 (initiated by [[Leslie Fox]] and [[Alan B Tayler|Alan Tayler]]). Subsequently, the format was adopted in other European countries to form ESGIs. Currently, with a variety of names, they appear in the same or a similar format throughout the world. More specific topics have also formed the subject of focussed meetings, such as the environment, medicine and agriculture.

Problems successfully tackled at study groups are discussed in a number of textbooks as well as a collection of case studies, European Success Stories in Industrial Mathematics. A guide for organising and running study groups is provided by the [[:fr:European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry]].

== European Study Group with Industry ==

A European Study Group with Industry or ESGI is a type of workshop where mathematicians work on problems presented by industry representatives. The meetings typically last five days, from Monday to Friday. On the Monday morning the industry representatives present problems of current interest to an audience of applied mathematicians. Subsequently, the mathematicians split into working groups to investigate the suggested topics. On the Friday solutions and results are presented back to the industry representative. After the meeting a report is prepared for the company, detailing the progress made and usually with suggestions for further work or experiments.

== History ==

The original Study Groups with Industry started in Oxford in 1968. The format provided a method for initiating interaction between universities and private industry which often led to further collaboration, student projects and new fields of research (many advances in the field of free or moving boundary problems are attributed to the industrial case studies of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=C.M.|last2=Ockendon|first2=J.R.|title=Weak and variational methods for free and moving boundary problems|date=1982|publisher=Pitman Publishing|isbn=0-273-08503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Study groups were later adopted in other countries, starting in Europe and then spreading throughout the world. The subject areas have also diversified, for example the Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-medicine.org/|title=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|last=|first=|date=|website=Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpib.ac.uk/outreach/mpssg/|title=Mathematics in the Plant Sciences Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the environment, uncertainty quantification and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maths-in-industry.org/past/|title=Mathematics in Industry {{!}} Past Study Groups|last=Bentahar|first=K.|website=www.maths-in-industry.org|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academics work on the problems for free. The following have been given as motivation for this work:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wits.ac.za/conferences/misgsa2016/|title=South African Maths in Industry Study Group|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Discovering new problems and research areas with practical applications.
# The possibility of further projects and collaboration with industry.
# The opportunity for future funding.

A number of reasons have also been quoted for companies to attend ESGIs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miis.maths.ox.ac.uk/how/|title=Maths in Industry Information Service, How|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The possibility of a quick solution to their problem, or at least guidance on a way forward.
# Mathematicians can help to identify and correctly formulate a problem for further study.
# Access to state-of-the-art techniques.
# Building contacts with top researchers in a given field.

ESGIs are currently an activity of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI|title=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/|website=European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ESGI webpage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ECMI ESGI|title=Study Groups|url=https://ecmiindmath.org/study-groups/|website=Study Groups|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains details of European meetings and contact details for prospective industry or academics participants. The current co-ordinator of the ESGIs is Prof. Tim Myers of the [[Centre de Recerca Matemàtica|Centre de Recerca Matemática]], Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre de Recerca Matemática|url=http://www.crm.cat||website=CRM|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2015 and 2019 ESGIs are eligible for funding through the COST network MI-Net (Maths for Industry Network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematics for Industry Network|url=https://mi-network.org/|website=MI-Net|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''evolutionary argument against naturalism''' ('''EAAN''') is a philosophical argument asserting a problem with believing both [[theory of evolution|evolution]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] simultaneously. The argument was first proposed by [[Alvin Plantinga]] in 1993 and "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Beilby(2002) p vii&lt;/ref&gt; The EAAN argues that the combined belief in both evolutionary theory and naturalism is epistemically [[self refuting idea|self-defeating]]. The argument for this is that if both evolution and naturalism are true, then the probability of having reliable cognitive faculties are low.

==Development of the idea==
The idea that "naturalism" undercuts its own justification was put forward by [[Arthur Balfour]].&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) p 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] popularised it in the first edition of his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' in 1947.&lt;ref name = Nathan&gt;{{cite journal| last = Nathan| first = N.M.L.| year = 1997| title = Naturalism and Self-Defeat: Plantinga's Version| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 135–42| jstor = 20008086| doi = 10.1017/S0034412597003855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments were advanced by [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]] in ''Metaphysics'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix&gt;Beilby(2002) p ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen R. L. Clark|Stephen Clark]],&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt;&lt;ref name = Balfour&gt;Arthur Balfour, The Foundations of Belief: Notes Introductory to the Study of Theology, 8th ed. Rev. with a new introduction and summary (1906) pp 279-285&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Purtill]]&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Purtill&gt;Richard Purtill, Reasons to Believe (1974) pp 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. P. Moreland]].&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Moreland&gt;J. P. Moreland, "God and the Argument from Mind", in Scaling the Secular City (1978) pp 77-105&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Victor Reppert]] developed a similar argument in detail in his book ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason''.&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt; Contemporary philosophers who have employed a similar argument against physical determinism are [[James N. Jordan|James Jordan]] and [[William Hasker]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) pp 204-275&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga proposed his "evolutionary argument against naturalism" in 1993.&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; In the twelfth chapter of his book ''Warrant and Proper Function'', Plantinga developed Lewis' idea,&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt; and constructed two formal arguments against evolutionary naturalism.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt; He further developed the idea in an unpublished manuscript entitled "Naturalism Defeated" and in his 2000 book ''Warranted Christian Belief'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; and expanded the idea in ''Naturalism Defeated?'', a 2002 anthology edited by [[James Beilby]]. He also responded to several objections to the argument in his essay "Reply to Beilby's Cohorts" in Beilby's anthology.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"&gt;Beilby(2002) p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008&gt;Alvin Plantinga, Michael Tooley, Knowledge of God (2008) pp 31-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plantinga's 1993 formulation of the argument==
Plantinga's argument attempted to show that to combine naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, because, under these assumptions, the probability that humans have reliable cognitive faculties is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref name = Warrant&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|authorlink=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant and Proper Function|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-507864-0|doi=10.1093/0195078640.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that several thinkers, including [[C. S. Lewis]], had seen that evolutionary naturalism seemed to lead to a deep and pervasive skepticism and to the conclusion that our unreliable cognitive or belief-producing faculties cannot be trusted to produce more true beliefs than false beliefs. He claimed that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] himself had worries along these lines" and quoted from an 1881 letter:&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2008/julaug/11.37.html |title=Evolution vs. Naturalism&amp;nbsp;— Books &amp; Culture |author=Alvin Plantinga |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |date=July–August 2008 |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beilby p 3"&gt;Beilby p 3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy.

In the letter, Darwin had expressed agreement with William Graham's claim that natural laws implied purpose and the belief that the universe was "not the result of chance", but again showed his doubts about such beliefs and left the matter as insoluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[James Moore (biographer)|Moore, James William]] |author2=[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond, Adrian J.]] |title=Darwin |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth [Eng.] |year=1992 |page=653 |isbn=0-14-013192-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin only had this doubt about questions beyond the scope of science, and thought science was well within the scope of an evolved mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Isaak |title=The counter-creationism handbook |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2007 |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-520-24926-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]] said that by presenting it as "Darwin's doubt" that evolutionary naturalism is self-defeating, Plantinga failed to note that Darwin at once excused himself from philosophical matters he did not feel competent to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |title=Darwinism and its discontents |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-521-82947-X|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Evan Fales, agreed that this citation allowed Plantinga to call the source of the problem EAAN addresses ''Darwin's Doubt''.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 46&lt;/ref&gt; Also, contrary to Ruse's claim, Plantinga gave the name "Darwin's Doubt" not to the idea that the conjunction of naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, but rather to the view that given naturalism and evolution our cognitive faculties are unlikely to be reliable.  Plantinga asserts that "this doubt arises for naturalists or atheists, but not for those who believe in God. That is because if God has created us in his image, then even if he fashioned us by some evolutionary means, he would presumably want us to resemble him in being able to know; but then most of what we believe might be true even if our minds have developed from those of the lower animals."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;

Plantinga defined:
* ''N'' as naturalism, which he defined as "the idea that there is no such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;
* ''E'' as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary theory
* ''R'' as the proposition that our faculties are "reliable", where, roughly, a cognitive faculty is "reliable" if the great bulk of its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a thermometer stuck at {{convert|72|°F}} placed in an environment which happened to be at 72&amp;nbsp;°F as an example of something that is not "reliable" in this sense&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"/&gt;

and suggested that the [[conditional probability]] of R given N and E, or P(R|N&amp;E), is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/naturalism_defeated.pdf|title=Naturalism Defeated, by Alvin Plantinga|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four jointly exhaustive categories:

#[[epiphenomenalism]], where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. "if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be ''invisible'' to evolution" so P(R|N&amp;E) would be low or inscrutable&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Semantic'' epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to behaviour but not by virtue of their ''semantic'' content.  Under this theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal event.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 6-7. Here Plantinga cites [[Robert Cummins]] as suggesting that this is the "received view"&lt;/ref&gt; However, on this view P(R|N&amp;E) would be low because the semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural selection, and it is semantic content that determines [[truth-value]].
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but ''maladaptive'', in which case P(R|N&amp;E) would be low, as R would be selected against.
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus P(R|N&amp;E) in this case would also be low.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga pointed out that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a tiger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps Paul very much ''likes'' the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him.  This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief.&amp;nbsp;... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it.&amp;nbsp;... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plantinga | first1 =  | year = | title = Warrant and Proper Function | url = | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 225–226 | doi = 10.1093/0195078640.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of [[metaphysical naturalism|philosophical naturalism]] and [[Naturalistic Evolution|naturalistic evolution]] is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically [[defeater|defeats]] the belief that naturalistic evolution is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Fitelson and Sober's response===
In a 1998 paper [[Branden Fitelson]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] set out to show that the arguments presented by Plantinga contain serious errors. Plantinga construed evolutionary naturalism as the conjunction of the idea that human cognitive faculties arose through evolutionary mechanisms, and naturalism which he equated to atheism. Plantinga tried to throw doubt on this conjunction with a preliminary argument that the conjunction is probably false, and a main argument that it is self-defeating, if you believe it you should stop believing it.&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, they criticised Plantinga's use of a [[Bayes Theorem|Bayesian]] framework in which he arbitrarily assigned initial probabilities without [[empirical evidence]], predetermining the outcome in favor of traditional theism, and described this as a recipe for replacing any non-deterministic theory in the natural sciences, so that for example a probable outcome predicted by [[quantum mechanics]] would be seen as the outcome of God's will. Plantinga's use of R to mean that "the great bulk" of our beliefs are true fails to deal with the cumulative effect of adding beliefs which have variable reliability about different subjects. Plantinga asserted that the traditional theist believes being made in God's image includes a reflection of divine powers as a knower, but [[cognitive science]] finds human reasoning subject to biases and systematic error. Traditional theology is not shown to predict this varying reliability as well as science, and there is the [[theodicy|theological problem]] of the omnipotent Creator producing such imperfection. They described how Plantinga set out various scenarios of belief affecting evolutionary success, but undercut the low probability he previously required when he suggested an "inscrutable" probability, and by ignoring availability of variants he fails to show that false beliefs will be equally adaptive as his claim of low probability assumes. Even if his claims of improbability were correct, that need not affect belief in evolution, and they considered it would be more sensible to accept that evolutionary processes sometimes have improbable outcomes.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

They assessed Plantinga's main argument which asserts that since the reliability of evolutionary naturalism is low or of inscrutable value, those believing it should withhold assent from its reliability, and thus withhold assent from anything else they believe including evolutionary naturalism, which is therefore self-defeating. They found this unconvincing, having already disputed his argument that the reliability is low. Even if ''E&amp;N'' defeated the claim that 'at least 90% of our beliefs are true,' they considered that Plantinga must show that it also defeats the more modest claim that 'at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true'. They considered his sentiment that high probability is required for rational belief to be repudiated by philosophical lessons such as the [[lottery paradox]], and that each step in his argument requires principles different from those he had described. They concluded that Plantinga has drawn attention to unreliability of cognitive processes that is already taken into account by evolutionary scientists who accept that science is a fallible exercise, and appreciate the need to be as scrupulous as possible with the fallible cognitive processes available. His [[hyperbolic doubt]] as a defeater for evolutionary naturalism is equally a defeater for theists who rely on their belief that their mind was designed by a non-deceiving God, and neither "can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

===Robbins' response===
[[Indiana University South Bend]] Professor of Philosophy J. Wesley Robbins contended that Plantinga's argument applied only to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian philosophies of mind]] but not to pragmatist philosophies of mind.  Robbins' argument, stated roughly, was that while in a Cartesian mind beliefs can be identified with no reference to the environmental factors that caused them, in a pragmatic mind they are identifiable ''only'' with reference to those factors. That is to say, in a pragmatic mind beliefs would not even exist if their holder had not come in contact with external belief-producing phenomena in the first place.&lt;ref name = Robbins&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robbins| first = J. Wesley| year = 1994| title = Is Naturalism Irrational?| journal = Faith and Philosophy| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 255–59| url =| doi=10.5840/faithphil199411216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Naturalism Defeated?''===
A collection of essays entitled ''Naturalism Defeated?'' (2002) contains responses by 11 philosophers to EAAN.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised, unless otherwised referenced, from the [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1105 review by John F Post]&lt;/ref&gt; According to James K. Beilby, editor of the volume, Plantinga's proposition "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt; The responsive essays include the following:
* William Ramsey argued that Plantinga "overlooks the most sensible way . . . to get clear on how truth can be a property of beliefs that bestows an advantage on cognitive systems". He also argued that ''some'' of our cognitive faculties ''are'' slightly unreliable, and ''E&amp;N'' seems better suited than theism to explain this imperfection.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argued that there is a plausible historical scenario according to which our minds were selected because their cognitive mechanisms produced, by and large, adaptive true beliefs.
* Evan Fales&lt;ref&gt;Fales's article, "Plantinga's Case Against Naturalistic Epistemology" is also reprinted at p387 et seq. of ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics'' ([[Robert T. Pennock]], editor, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plantinga had not demonstrated that the reliability of our cognitive faculties is improbable, given Neo-Darwinism, and emphasizes that "if Plantinga's argument fails here, then he will not have shown that [N&amp;E] is probabilistically incoherent." Also, given how expensive (in biological terms) our brain is, and considering we are rather unremarkable creatures apart from our brains, it would be quite improbable that our rational faculties be selected if unreliable. "Most of our eggs are in that basket," said Fales. Fales argued along the same as Robbins: take a [[mental representation]], of heat, for example. Only so long as it is really caused by heat can we call it a mental representation of heat; otherwise, it is not at all a mental representation, of heat or of anything else: "so long as representations [semantics] are causally linked to the world via the syntactic structures in the brain to which they correspond [syntax], this will guarantee that syntax maps onto semantics in a generally truth-preserving way."&lt;ref name = Fales&gt;{{cite journal| last = Fales| first = Evan| year = 1996| title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology| journal = Philosophy of Science| volume = 63| issue = 3| pages = 432–51| jstor= 188104| doi = 10.1086/289920}}, cited in ''Naturalism Defeated?'' as being an earlier version of Fales' response.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct response to one of Plantinga's scenarios where, according to Plantinga, false-belief generating mechanisms may have been naturally selected.
* Michael Bergmann suggested that [[Thomas Reid]] offered the resources for a commonsense (Reidian) defense of naturalism against EAAN.
* [[Ernest Sosa]] drew on features of [[Descartes]]' epistemology to argue that while "[i]ssues of circularity do arise as to how we can rationally and knowledgeably adopt [an epistemically propitious] view about our own epistemic powers," nonetheless, "these problems are not exclusive to naturalism."
* James Van Cleve suggested that even if the probability thesis is true, it need not deliver an undefeated defeater to R, and that even if one has a defeater for R, it doesn't follow that one has a defeater for everything.
* Richard Otte thought that the argument "ignore[d] other information we have that would make R likely."
* William Talbott suggested that "Plantinga has misunderstood the role of undercutting defeaters in reasoning."
* [[Trenton Merricks]] said that "in general, inferences from low or inscrutable conditional probability to defeat are unjustified."
* [[William Alston]] argued that the claim that P(R/N&amp;E) is low is poorly supported; if, instead, it is inscrutable, this has no clear relevance to the claim that (1) is a defeater for N&amp;E.

''Naturalism Defeated?'' also included Plantinga's replies to both the critical responses contained in the book and to some objections raised by others, including Fitelson &amp; Sober:
* Plantinga expounded the notion of ''Rationality Defeaters'' in terms of his theory of warrant and proper function and distinguishes between Humean Defeaters and Purely Alethic Defeaters, suggesting that although a naturalist will continue to assume R "but (if he reflects on the matter) he will also think, sadly enough, that what he can't help believing is unlikely to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 211&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plantinga argued that ''semantic epiphenomenalism'' is very likely on N&amp;E because, if [[materialism]] is true, beliefs would have to be neurophysiological events whose ''propositional'' content cannot plausibly enter the causal chain.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp211-213 - he says that these arguments are "related in ways that are not entirely clear to arguments made by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in ''Mind in a Physical World''&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that the ''reliability'' of a cognitive process requires the truth of a substantial proportion of the beliefs it produces, and that a process which delivered beliefs whose probability of truth was in the neighbourhood of 0.5 would have a vanishingly unlikely chance of producing (say) 1000 beliefs 75% of which were true.
* In ''The conditionalisation problem,'' Plantinga discussed the possibility that N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. "Naturalism plus R," could be a basic belief thus staving off defeat of R, suggesting that this procedure cannot be right in general otherwise every defeater could automatically be defeated, introducing the term "''defeater-deflector''&lt;ref&gt;''ie'' something that prevents D (a supposed Defeater) from being a defeater in the first place, as opposed to a defeater-defeater which defeats D Beilby(2002) p224.&lt;/ref&gt; " and initially exploring the conditions under which a defeater-deflector can be valid.
* Plantinga concluded that the objections pose a challenge to EAAN, but that there are successful arguments against the objections.

===Ruse's response===
In a chapter titled 'The New Creationism: Its Philosophical Dimension', in ''The Cultures of Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]] discussed EAAN. He argued:
*That the EAAN conflates methodological and metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187&gt;Coleman(2004) p187&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "we need to make a distinction that Plantinga fudges" between "the world as we can in some sense discover" and "the world in some absolute sense, metaphysical reality if you like." Then, "Once this distinction is made, Plantinga's refutation of naturalism no longer seems so threatening."&lt;ref name=Coleman188&gt;Coleman(2004) p188&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "It is certainly the case that organisms are sometimes deceived about the world of appearances and that this includes humans. Sometimes we are systematically deceived, as instructors in elementary psychology classes delight in demonstrating. Moreover, evolution can often give good reasons as to why we are deceived." We know there are misconceptions arising from selection as we can measure them against reliable touchstones, but in Plantinga's hypothesised deceptions we are deceived all the time which is "not how evolution's deceptions work".&lt;ref name=Coleman188/&gt; He comments that in Plantinga's thinking we have confusion between the world as we know it, and the world as it might be knowable in some ultimate way, but "If we are all in an illusion then it makes no sense to talk of illusion, for we have no touchstone of reality to make absolute judgements."&lt;ref name=Coleman190/&gt;

Ruse concluded his discussion of the EAAN by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To be honest, even if Plantinga's argument [the EAAN] worked, I would still want to know where theism ends (and what form this theism must take) and where science can take over. Is it the case that evolution necessarily cannot function, or it is merely false and in another God-created world it might have held in some way&amp;nbsp;— and if so, in what way? Plantinga has certainly not shown that the theist must be a creationist, even though his own form of theism is creationism.&lt;ref name=Coleman190&gt;Coleman(2004) pp189–190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==C.S. Lewis framing==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It's like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can't trust my own thinking, of course I can't trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Plantinga's 2008 formulation of the argument==
In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008/&gt;

Plantinga stated that from a materialist's point of view a belief will be a neuronal event. In this conception a belief will have two different sorts of properties:&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;
*''electro-chemical'' or ''neurophysiological'' properties (''NP'' properties for short)
*and the property of having ''content'' (It will have to be the belief that ''p'', for some proposition ''p'').
Plantinga thought that we have something of an idea as to the history of NP properties: structures with these properties have come to exist by small increments, each increment such that it has proved to be useful in the struggle for survival. But he then asked how the ''content'' property of a belief came about: "How does it [the content] get to be associated in that way with a given proposition?"&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He said that materialists offer two theories for this question: According to the first, content ''[[Supervenience|supervenes]] upon'' NP properties; according to the second, content ''is reducible to'' NP properties. (He noted that if content properties are reducible to NP properties, then they also supervene upon them.) He explained the two theories as follows:
*Reducibility: A belief is a disjunction of conjunctions of NP properties.
*Strong Supervenience (S+): For any possible worlds ''W'' and ''W*'' and any structures ''S'' and ''S*'', if ''S'' has the same NP properties in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*'', then ''S'' has the same content in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*''. Supervenience can either be broadly logical supervenience or nomic supervenience.
Plantinga argued that neural structures that constitute beliefs have ''content'', in the following way: "At a certain level of complexity, these neural structures start to display content. Perhaps this starts gradually and early on (possibly C. elegans [a small worm with a nervous system composed of only a few neurons] displays just the merest glimmer of consciousness and the merest glimmer of content), or perhaps later and more abruptly; that doesn't matter. What does matter is that at a certain level of complexity of neural structures, content appears. This is true whether content properties are reducible to NP properties or supervene on them."&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 37&lt;/ref&gt;
So given materialism some neural structures at a given level of complexity acquire content and become beliefs. The question then is according to Plantinga: "what is the likelihood, ''given materialism'', that the content that thus arises is in fact ''true''?"&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"/&gt;

This way of proceeding replaced the first step of Plantinga's earlier versions of the argument.

==EAAN, intelligent design and theistic evolution==
In his discussion of EAAN, [[Michael Ruse]] described Plantinga as believing in the truth of the attack on evolution presented by [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]], and as having endorsed Johnson's book ''[[Darwin on Trial]]''. Ruse said that Plantinga took the [[Conflict thesis|conflict between science and religion]] further than Johnson, seeing it as not just a clash between the philosophies of naturalism and theism, but as an attack on the true philosophy of theism by what he considers the incoherent and inconsistent philosophy of naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187/&gt;

Plantinga has stated that EAAN is not directed against "the theory of evolution, or the claim that human beings have evolved from simian ancestors, or anything in that neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the problems raised by EAAN do not apply to the conjunction of [[theism]] and contemporary evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''Evolution and Design'' Plantinga outlines different ways in which [[theism]] and [[evolutionary theory]] can be combined.&lt;ref&gt;For Faith and Clarity, Philosophical Contributions to Christian Theology, Ed. James Beilby (2006) p 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the anthology ''Naturalism Defeated?'' James Beilby wrote: "Plantinga's argument should ''not'' be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic."&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

An '''expanded genetic code''' is an artificially modified [[genetic code]] in which one or more specific [[codon]]s have been re-allocated to encode an [[amino acid]] that is not among the 20 common naturally-encoded [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xie | first1 = J | last2 = Schultz | first2 = PG | title = Adding amino acids to the genetic repertoire | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–54 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16260173 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2005.10.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key prerequisites to expand the genetic code are:
* the non-standard amino acid to encode,
* an unused codon to adopt,
* a tRNA that recognises this codon, and
* a tRNA synthetase that recognises only that tRNA and only the non-standard amino acid.

Expanding the genetic code is an area of research of [[synthetic biology]], an applied biological discipline whose goal is to engineer living systems for useful purposes. The genetic code expansion enriches the repertoire of useful tools available to science.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins are produced thanks to the translational system molecules, which decode the RNA messages into a string of amino acids. The [[translation (biology)|translation]] of genetic information contained in [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) into a protein is catalysed by [[ribosome]]s. [[Transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) are used as keys to decode the [[ribonucleic acid|mRNA]] into its encoded [[polypeptide]]. The tRNA recognizes a specific three nucleotide codon in the mRNA with a [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] sequence called the [[anticodon]] on one of its loops. Each three nucleotide codon is translated into one of twenty naturally occurring amino acids.&lt;ref name="Wang 2001" /&gt;  There is at least one tRNA for any codon, and sometimes multiple codons code for the same amino acid. Many tRNAs are compatible with several codons. An enzyme called an [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] covalently attaches the amino acid to the appropriate tRNA.&lt;ref name="Alberts 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts, et. al|first=Bruce|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2008|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-4105-9|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most cells have a different synthetase for each amino acid (20 or more synthetases). On the other hand, some bacteria have fewer than 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and introduce the "missing" amino acid(s) by modification of a structurally related amino acid by an [[aminotransferase]] enzyme.&lt;ref name="Woese 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woese, et. al|first=Carl|journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.|title=Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the genetic code, and the evolutionary process.|year=2000|volume=64|pages=202–236|doi=10.1128/mmbr.64.1.202-236.2000|pmid=10704480|pmc=98992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A feature exploited in the expansion of the genetic code is the fact that the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase often does not recognize the anticodon, but another part of the tRNA, meaning that if the anticodon were to be mutated the encoding of that amino acid would change to a new codon.
In the ribosome, the information in mRNA is translated into a specific amino acid when the mRNA codon matches with the complementary anticodon of a tRNA, and the attached amino acid is added onto a growing polypeptide chain. When it is released from the ribosome, the polypeptide chain folds into a functioning protein.&lt;ref name="Alberts 2008" /&gt;

In order to incorporate a novel amino acid into the genetic code several changes are required. First, for successful translation of a novel amino acid, the codon to which the novel amino acid is assigned cannot already code for one of the 20 natural amino acids. Usually a nonsense codon ([[stop codon]]) or a four-base codon are used.&lt;ref name="Wang 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=L.|author2=Brock, A. |author3=Herberich, B. |author4=Schultz, P. G. |title=Expanding the Genetic Code of Escherichia coli|journal=Science|date=April 2001|volume=292|issue=5516|pages=498–500|doi=10.1126/science.1060077 | pmid = 11313494 |bibcode = 2001Sci...292..498W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a novel pair of tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase are required, these are called the orthogonal set. The orthogonal set must not crosstalk with the endogenous tRNA and synthetase sets, while still being functionally compatible with the ribosome and other components of the translation apparatus.  The active site of the synthetase is modified to accept only the novel amino acid.  Most often, a library of mutant synthetases is screened for one which charges the tRNA with the desired amino acid. The synthetase is also modified to  recognize only the orthogonal tRNA.&lt;ref name="Wang 2001" /&gt; The tRNA synthetase pair is often engineered in other bacteria or eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref name=pmid12409460 /&gt;

In this area of research, the 20 encoded proteinogenic amino acids are referred to as standard amino acids, or alternatively as natural or canonical amino acids, while the added amino acids are called non-standard amino acids (NSAAs), or unnatural amino acids (uAAs; term not used in papers dealing with natural non-proteinogenic amino acids, such as [[phosphoserine]]), or non-canonical amino acids.

The first element of the system is the amino acid that is added to the genetic code of a certain strain of organism.

Over 71 different NSAAs have been added to different strains of ''E. coli'', yeast or mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=Liu2010&gt;{{cite journal

Availability of the non-standard amino acid requires that the organism either import it from the medium or biosynthesised it.
In the first case, the unnatural amino acid is first synthesised chemically in optically pure &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cardillo|first1=G|last2=Gentilucci|first2=L|last3=Tolomelli|first3=A|title=Unusual amino acids: synthesis and introduction into naturally occurring peptides and biologically active analogues.|journal=Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry|date=March 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=293–304|pmid=16515468|doi=10.2174/138955706776073394}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then added to the growth medium of the cell.&lt;ref name=Liu2010 /&gt; Generally a library of compounds is tested to see which can be imported and incorporated, but often the various transport systems can handle unnatural amino acids with apolar side-chains.
In the second case, a biosynthetic paths need to be engineered. One example is an ''E. coli'' strain that biosynthesizes a novel, previously unnatural amino acid (p-aminophenylalanine) from basic carbon sources and includes this amino acid in its genetic code.&lt;ref name="SchultzLab" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Chemical Society''. 2003 Jan 29;125(4):935-9.

== Codon assignment ==
Another element of the system is a codon to allocate to the new amino acid.

A major problem for the genetic code expansion is that there are no free codons. The genetic code has a nonrandom layout that shows tell-tale signs of various phases of primordial evolution, however, it has since frozen into place and is near-universally conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Nevertheless, some codons are rarer than others. In fact, in ''E. coli'' (and all organisms) the codon usage is not equal, but presents several rare codons (see table), the rarest being the amber stop codon (UAG).

=== Amber codon suppression ===
The possibility of reassigning codons was realized by Normanly ''et al.'' in 1990, when a viable mutant strain of ''E. coli''  read through the UAG ("amber") [[stop codon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80258-X | last1 = Normanly | first1 =  J| last2 = Kleina | first2 = L.G. | last3 = Masson | first3 = J.M. | last4 = Abelson | first4 = J. | last5 = Miller | first5 = J.H. | year = 1990 | title = Construction of Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA genes.

This was possible thanks to the rarity of this codon and the fact that release factor 1 alone makes the amber codon terminate translation. Later, in the [[Peter G. Schultz|Schultz]] lab, the tRNATyr/tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) from ''[[Methanococcus jannaschii]]'', an archaebacterium,&lt;ref name="Wang 2001" /&gt; was used to introduce a tyrosine instead of STOP, the default value of the amber codon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja000595y | last1 = Wang | first1 = L. | last2 = Magliery | first2 = T.J. | last3 = Liu | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Schultz | first4 = P.G. | year = 2000 | title = A new functional suppressor tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair for the in vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | url = http://www.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~magliery/pdfs/WangSchultz2000JACS.pdf | journal = J.

Subsequently, the group evolved the orthologonal tRNA/synthase pair to utilise the non-standard amino acid ''O''-methyltyrosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=L|last2=Brock|first2=A|last3=Herberich|first3=B|last4=Schultz|first4=PG|title=Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli.|journal=Science|date=20 April 2001|volume=292|issue=5516|pages=498–500|pmid=11313494|doi=10.1126/science.1060077|bibcode = 2001Sci...292..498W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the larger naphthylalanine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=L|last2=Brock|first2=A|last3=Schultz|first3=PG|title=Adding L-3-(2-Naphthyl)alanine to the genetic code of E. coli.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=6 March 2002|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1836–7|pmid=11866580|doi=10.1021/ja012307j}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the photocrosslinking benzoylphenylalanine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chin|first1=JW|last2=Martin|first2=AB|last3=King|first3=DS|last4=Wang|first4=L|last5=Schultz|first5=PG|title=Addition of a photocrosslinking amino acid to the genetic code of Escherichiacoli.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=20 August 2002|volume=99|issue=17|pages=11020–4|pmid=12154230|doi=10.1073/pnas.172226299|bibcode = 2002PNAS...9911020C|pmc=123203}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proved the potential utility of the system.

The amber codon is the least used codon in ''Escherichia coli'', but hijacking it results in a substantial loss of fitness. One study in fact found that there were at least 83 peptides majorly affected by the readthrough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In most ''E. coli'' K-12 strains (viz. [[Escherichia coli (molecular biology)|''Escherichia coli'' (molecular biology)]] for strain pedigrees) there are 314 UAG stop codons. Consequently, a gargantuan amount of work has gone into the replacement of these. One approach pioneered by the group of Prof. George Church from Harvard, was dubbed MAGE in CAGE: this relied on a multiplex transformation and subsequent strain recombination to remove all UAG codons—the latter part presented a halting point in a first paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Rare sense codon reassignment ===
In addition to the amber codon, rare sense codons have also been considered for use. The AGG codon codes for arginine, but a strain has been successfully modified to make it code for 6-''N''-allyloxycarbonyl-lysine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Another candidate is the AUA codon, which is unusual in that its respective tRNA has to differentiate against AUG that codes for methionine (primordially, isoleucine, hence its location). In order to do this, the AUA tRNA has a special base, lysidine. The deletion of the synthase (''tilS'') was possible thanks to the replacement of the native tRNA with that of ''Mycoplasma mobile'' (no lysidine). The reduced fitness is a first step towards pressuring the strain to loose all instances of AUA, allowing it to be used for genetic code expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohlke|first1=N|last2=Budisa|first2=N|title=Sense codon emancipation for proteome-wide incorporation of noncanonical amino acids: rare isoleucine codon AUA as a target for genetic code expansion.|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|date=February 2014|volume=351|issue=2|pages=133–44|pmid=24433543|doi=10.1111/1574-6968.12371|pmc=4237120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches include the addition of extra base pairing or the use of orthologous ribosomes that accept in addition to the regular triplet genetic code, tRNAs with quadruple code.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.12.027| title = Recent advances in genetic code engineering in Escherichia coli| journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology| volume = 23| issue = 5| pages = 751–7| year = 2012| last1 = Hoesl | first1 = M.

== tRNA/synthetase pair ==
Another key element is the tRNA/synthetase pair.

The orthologous set of synthetase and tRNA can be mutated and screened through directed evolution to charge the tRNA with a different, even novel, amino acid. Mutations to the plasmid containing the pair can be introduced by error-prone PCR or through degenerate primers for the synthetase's active site.
Selection involves multiple rounds of a two-step process, where the plasmid is transferred into cells expressing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase with a premature amber codon.  In the presence of toxic chloramphenicol and the non-natural amino acid, the surviving cells will have overridden the amber codon using the orthogonal tRNA aminoacylated with either the standard amino acids or the non-natural one. To remove the former, the plasmid is inserted into cells with a barnase gene (toxic) with a premature amber codon but without the non-natural amino acid, removing all the orthogonal synthases that do not specifically recognize the non-natural amino acid.&lt;ref name="Wang 2001" /&gt;
In addition to the recoding of the tRNA to a different codon, they can be mutated to recognize a four-base codon, allowing additional free coding options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1263/jbb.105.211 | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = T | last2 = Muranaka | first2 = N | last3 = Hohsaka | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = Four-base codon-mediated saturation mutagenesis in a cell-free translation system | url = | journal = J Biosci Bioeng | volume = 105 | issue = 3| pages = 211–5 | pmid = 18397770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The non-natural amino acid, as a result, introduces diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to explore [[protein structure]] and function or to create novel or enhanced protein for practical purposes.

=== Orthogonal sets in ''E. coli'' ===
The orthogonal pairs of synthetase and tRNA that work for one organism may not work for another, as the synthetase may mis-aminoacylate endogenous tRNAs or the tRNA be mis-aminoacylated itself by an endogenous synthetase. As a result, the sets created to date differ between organisms.

== Orthogonal Ribosomes ==
Similarly to orthogonal tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), orthogonal ribosomes have been engineered to work in parallel to the natural ribosomes. Orthogonal ribosomes ideally use different mRNA transcripts than their natural counterparts and ultimately should draw on a separate pool of tRNA as well. This should alleviate some of the loss of fitness which currently still arises from techniques such as Amber codon suppression. Additionally, orthogonal ribosomes can be mutated and optimized for particular tasks, like the recognition of quadruplet codons. Such an optimization is not possible, or highly disadvantageous for natural ribosomes.

=== o-Ribosome ===
In 2005 three sets of ribosomes were published, which did not recognize natural mRNA, but instead translated a separate pool of orthogonal mRNA (o-mRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nchembio719 | last1 = Chin| first1 = J. W. | last2 = Rackham| first2 = Oliver | year = 2005| title = A network of orthogonal ribosomedotmRNA pairs | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–166 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved by changing the recognition sequence of the mRNA, the [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]], and the corresponding recognition sequence in the 16S rRNA of ribosomes, the so-called Anti-Shine-Darlgarno-Sequence. This way the base pairing, which is usually lost if either sequence is mutated, stays available. However the mutations in the 16S rRNA were not limited to the obviously base-pairing nucleotides of the classical Anti-Shine-Darlgarno sequence.

=== Ribo-X ===
In 2007 the group of Jason W. Chin presented an orthogonal ribosome, which was optimized for Amber codon suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nbt1314 | last1 = Wang| first1 = Kaihang  | last2 = Neumann| first2 = Heinz | last3 = Peak-Chew | first3 = Sew Y | last4 = Chin | first4 = Jason W. | year = 2007 | title = Evolved orthogonal ribosomes enhance the efficiency of synthetic genetic code expansion | url = | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 770–777 | pmid = | pmc = | display-authors = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16S rRNA was mutated in such a way that it bound the release factor RF1 less strongly than the natural ribosome does. This ribosome did not eliminate the problem of lowered cell fitness caused by suppressed stop codons in natural proteins. However through the improved specificity it raised the yields of correctly synthesized target protein significantly (from ~20% to &gt;60% percent for one amber codon to be suppressed and form &lt;1% to &gt;20% for two amber codons).

=== Ribo-Q ===
In 2010 the group of Jason W. Chin presented a further optimized version of the orthogonal ribosome. The Ribo-Q is a 16S rRNA optimized to recognize tRNAs, which have quadruplet anti-codons to recognize quadruplet codons, instead of the natural triplet codons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; With this approach the number of possible codons rises from 64 to 256. Even accounting for a variety of stop codons, more than 200 different amino acids could potentially be encoded this way.

=== Ribosome stappling ===
The orthogonal ribosomes described above all focus on optimizing the 16S rRNA. Thus far, this optimized 16S rRNA was combined with natural large-subunits to form orthogonal ribosomes. If the 23S rRNA, the main RNA-component of the large ribosomal subunit, is to be optimized as well, it had to be assured, that there was no crosstalk in the assembly of orthogonal and natural ribosomes (see figureX B). To ensure that optimized 23S rRNA would only form into ribosomes with the optimized 16S rRNA, the two rRNAs were combined into one transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/anie.201506311 | last1 = Fried| first1 = S. D.| last2 = Schmied| first2 = W. H.| last3 = Uttamapinant | first3 = C. | last4 = Chin | first4 = Jason W. | year = 2015 | title = Ribosome Subunit Stapling for Orthogonal Translation in E. coli | url = | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 54 | issue = 43 | pages = 12791–12794 | pmid = 27570300| pmc = 4985662}}&lt;/ref&gt; By inserting the sequence for the 23S rRNA into a loop-region of the 16S rRNA sequence, both subunits still adopt functioning folds. Since the two rRNAs are linked and thus in constant proximity, they preferably bind each other, not other free floating ribosomal subunits.

===Engineered peptidyl transferase center===
In 2014 it was shown that by altering the peptidyl transferase center of the 23S rRNA, ribosomes could be created which draw on orthogonal pools of tRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nchembio.1549 | last1 = Terasaka| first1 = Naohiro | last2 = Hayashi| first2 = Gosuke | last3 = Katoh | first3 = Takayuki | last4 = Suga| first4 = Hiroaki | year = 2014| title = An orthogonal ribosome-tRNA pair via engineering of the peptidyl transferase center | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 555–557 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3’ end of tRNAs is universally conserved to be CCA. The two cytidines base pair with two guanines the 23S rRNA to bind the tRNA to the ribosome. This interaction is required for translational fidelity. However, by co-mutating the binding nucleotides in such a way, that they can still base pair, the translational fidelity can be conserved. The 3’-end of the tRNA is mutated from CCA to CGA, while two cytidine nucleotides in the ribosomes [[Translation (biology)#Basic mechanisms|A- and P-sites]] are mutated to guanidine. This leads to ribosomes which do not accept naturally occurring tRNAs as substrates and to tRNAs, which cannot be used as substrate by natural ribosomes. &lt;br /&gt;
To use such tRNAs effectively, they would have to be aminoacylated by specific, orthogonal aaRSs. Most naturally occurring aaRSs recognize the 3’-end of their corresponding tRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1096/fasebj.7.1.8422978 | last1 = Cavarelli| first1 = J.| last2 = Moras| first2 = D.| year = 1993| title = Recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases | url = | journal = The FASEB Journal | volume = 7| issue = 1 | pages = 79–86 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.48.070179.003125 | last1 = Schimmel| first1 = Paul R. | last2 = Söll| first2 = Dieter | year = 1979| title = Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases: General Features and Recognition of Transfer RNAs | url = | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 48| issue = | pages = 601–648 | pmid = 382994| pmc = | display-authors = }}&lt;/ref&gt; aaRSs for these 3’-mutated tRNAs are not available yet. Thus far, this system has only been shown to work in an [[Cell-free protein synthesis|in-vitro translation]] setting where the aminoacylation of the orthogonal tRNA was achieved using so called “flexizymes”.

== Applications ==
With an expanded genetic code, the unnatural amino acid can be genetically directed to any chosen site in the protein of interest. The high efficiency and fidelity of this process allows a better control of the placement of the modification compared to modifying the protein post-translationally, which, in general, will target all amino acids of the same type, such as the thiol group of [[cysteine]] and the amino group of lysine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Q | last2 = Parrish | first2 = AR | last3 = Wang | first3 = L | title = Expanding the Genetic Code for Biological Studies | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–36 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19318213 | pmc = 2696486 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, an expanded genetic code allows modifications to be carried out ''in vivo''.
The ability to site-specifically direct lab-synthesized chemical moieties into proteins allows many types of studies that would otherwise be extremely difficult, such as:
* Probing protein structure and function: By using amino acids with slightly different size such as ''O''-methyltyrosine or dansylalanine instead of tyrosine, and by inserting genetically coded reporter moieties (color-changing and/or spin-active) into selected protein sites, chemical information about the protein's structure and function can be measured.
* Probing the role of post-translational modifications in protein structure and function: By using amino acids that mimic [[post-translational modification]]s such as phosphoserine, biologically active protein can be obtained, and the site-specific nature of the amino acid incorporation can lead to information on how the position, density, and distribution of protein phosphorylation effect protein function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Expanding the Genetic Code of Escherichia coli with Phosphoserine|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6046/1151|journal = Science|date = 2011-08-26|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 21868676|pages = 1151–1154|volume = 333|issue = 6046|doi = 10.1126/science.1207203|first = Hee-Sung|last = Park|first2 = Michael J.|last2 = Hohn|first3 = Takuya|last3 = Umehara|first4 = Li-Tao|last4 = Guo|first5 = Edith M.|last5 = Osborne|first6 = Jack|last6 = Benner|first7 = Christopher J.|last7 = Noren|first8 = Jesse|last8 = Rinehart|first9 = Dieter|last9 = Söll|bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1151P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Robust production of recombinant phosphoproteins using cell-free protein synthesis|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150909/ncomms9168/full/ncomms9168.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-09-09|pmc = 4566161|pmid = 26350765|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9168|first = Javin P.|last = Oza|first2 = Hans R.|last2 = Aerni|first3 = Natasha L.|last3 = Pirman|first4 = Karl W.|last4 = Barber|first5 = Charlotte M.|last5 = ter Haar|first6 = Svetlana|last6 = Rogulina|first7 = Matthew B.|last7 = Amrofell|first8 = Farren J.|last8 = Isaacs|first9 = Jesse|last9 = Rinehart|pages=8168|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8168O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A flexible codon in genomically recoded Escherichia coli permits programmable protein phosphorylation|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150909/ncomms9130/full/ncomms9130.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-09-09|pmc = 4566969|pmid = 26350500|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9130|first = Natasha L.|last = Pirman|first2 = Karl W.|last2 = Barber|first3 = Hans R.|last3 = Aerni|first4 = Natalie J.|last4 = Ma|first5 = Adrian D.|last5 = Haimovich|first6 = Svetlana|last6 = Rogulina|first7 = Farren J.|last7 = Isaacs|first8 = Jesse|last8 = Rinehart|pages=8130|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8130P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Efficient genetic encoding of phosphoserine and its nonhydrolyzable analog|journal = Nature Chemical Biology|date = 2015-01-01|volume = 11|issue = 7|pages = 496–503|doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1823|pmid = 26030730|first = Daniel T|last = Rogerson|first2 = Amit|last2 = Sachdeva|first3 = Kaihang|last3 = Wang|first4 = Tamanna|last4 = Haq|first5 = Agne|last5 = Kazlauskaite|first6 = Susan M|last6 = Hancock|first7 = Nicolas|last7 = Huguenin-Dezot|first8 = Miratul M K|last8 = Muqit|first9 = Andrew M|last9 = Fry|pmc=4830402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identifying and regulating protein activity: By using photocaged aminoacids, protein function can be "switched" on or off by illuminating the organism.
* Changing the mode of action of a protein: One can start with the gene for a protein that binds a certain sequence of DNA and, by inserting a chemically active amino acid into the binding site, convert it to a protein that cuts the DNA rather than binding it.
* Improving immunogenicity and overcoming self-tolerance: By replacing strategically chosen tyrosines with ''p''-nitro phenylalanine, a tolerated [[self-protein]] can be made immunogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Future ==
The expansion of the genetic code is still in its infancy. Current methodology uses only one non-standard amino acid at the time, whereas ideally multiple could be used.

=== Recoded synthetic genome ===
One way to achieve the encoding of multiple unnatural amino acids is by rewriting genome synthetically.&lt;ref name=future&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnakumar|first1=R|last2=Ling|first2=J|title=Experimental challenges of sense codon reassignment: an innovative approach to genetic code expansion.|journal=FEBS Letters|date=31 January 2014|volume=588|issue=3|pages=383–8|pmid=24333334|doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2013.11.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, at the cost of $40 million an organism, ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]'', was constructed that was controlled by a synthetic genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibson|first1=DG|last2=Glass|first2=JI|last3=Lartigue|first3=C|last4=Noskov|first4=VN|last5=Chuang|first5=RY|last6=Algire|first6=MA|last7=Benders|first7=GA|last8=Montague|first8=MG|last9=Ma|first9=L|last10=Moodie|first10=MM|last11=Merryman|first11=C|last12=Vashee|first12=S|last13=Krishnakumar|first13=R|last14=Assad-Garcia|first14=N|last15=Andrews-Pfannkoch|first15=C|last16=Denisova|first16=EA|last17=Young|first17=L|last18=Qi|first18=ZQ|last19=Segall-Shapiro|first19=TH|last20=Calvey|first20=CH|last21=Parmar|first21=PP|last22=Hutchison CA|first22=3rd|last23=Smith|first23=HO|last24=Venter|first24=JC|title=Creation of a bacterial cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome.|journal=Science|date=2 July 2010|volume=329|issue=5987|pages=52–6|pmid=20488990|doi=10.1126/science.1190719|bibcode = 2010Sci...329...52G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the larger genome size this is not possible with ''E. coli'', however several methods are being developed to overcome this, such as the fragmentation of the genome into separate linear chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=X|last2=Baek|first2=CH|last3=Katzen|first3=F|title=Escherichia coli with two linear chromosomes.|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|date=20 December 2013|volume=2|issue=12|pages=734–40|pmid=24160891|doi=10.1021/sb400079u}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the elimination of the usage of rare codons, the specificity of the system needs to be increased as many tRNA recognise several codons&lt;ref name=future /&gt;

=== Expanded genetic alphabet ===
{{Main|Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)|l1=Unnatural base pair}}
Another approach is to expand the number of nucleobases to increase the coding capacity.

An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. A demonstration of UBPs were achieved ''in vitro'' by Ichiro Hirao's group at [[RIKEN]] institute in Japan. In 2002, they developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions ''in vitro'' in transcription and translation for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirao | first1 = I. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogs into proteins | url = | journal = Nat.

The objective of expanding the genetic code is more radical as it does not replace an amino acid, but it adds one or more to the code.

The genetic code expansion described above is ''in vivo''. An alternative is the change of coding ''in vitro'' translation experiments. This requires the depletion of all tRNAs and the selective reintroduction of certain aminoacylated-tRNAs, some chemically aminoacylated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=SH|last2=Kwon|first2=YC|last3=Jewett|first3=MC|title=Non-standard amino acid incorporation into proteins using Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis|journal=Frontiers in Chemistry|date=2014|volume=2|page=34|pmid=24959531|pmc=4050362|doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00034|bibcode=2014FrCh....2...34H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical synthesis ===
{{Main|Peptide synthesis}}
There are several techniques to produce [[peptide]]s chemically, generally it is by solid-phase protection chemistry. This means that any (protected) amino acid can be added into the nascent sequence.

In November 2017, a team from the [[Scripps Research Institute]] reported having constructed a semi-synthetic ''E. coli'' bacteria genome using six different nucleic acids (versus four found in nature). The two extra 'letters' form a third, unnatural base pair. The resulting organisms were able to thrive and synthesize proteins using "unnatural amino acids".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42167569 'Unnatural' microbe can make proteins].

'''Freeway removal''' is a [[public policy]] of [[urban planning]] policy to demolish [[freeways]] and create [[mixed-use]] urban areas, parks, residential, commercial, or other land uses. Such highway removal is often part of a policy to promote [[smart growth]], [[transit-oriented development]], [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[bicycle-friendly]] cities. In some cases freeways are re-imagined as [[boulevard]]s, rebuilt as tunneled freeways (see [[tunnel]]s) or relocated through less densely-developed areas.

== Urban design ==
Urban freeways were built to expedite traffic into and out of cities in the mid 20th century. Many of these freeways were built through dense neighborhoods, and destroyed blocks and sometimes entire neighborhoods in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/|title=60 Years of Urban Change: Midwest|date=2014-12-12|work=The Institute for Quality Communities|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities, strategies were implemented or planned for freeway removal policies to tear down highways that cut through neighborhoods. These freeways created blight that minimized use of land space and reduced the quality of life for city residents. The alternative that some cities have chosen for [[urban design]] is to replace elevated highways with [[boulevard]]s to restore neighborhoods affected by highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/2017/09/11/reconnecting-cities-through-urban-highway-removals/|title=Reconnecting Cities through Urban Highway Removals - Car Free America|date=2017-09-11|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions, freeway removal has been proposed but these plans have not yet been completed or funded. In many cases, there are political battles between citizens' groups who are proponents of freeway removal proposals and drivers that want to keep the freeways.&lt;ref name="preservation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.preservenet.com/freeways/FreewaysPlansProposals.html |title= Freeway Removal Plans and Proposals |author= Staff |publisher= Preservation Institute |year= 2007 |accessdate= November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase land usage, the demolition of freeways is often a part of the discussion for both city and state’s governmental strategies. Cities planning redevelopment of certain neighborhoods, such as [[Washington, D.C.]]’s [[Whitehurst Freeway]] in the neighborhood of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], were set for demolition but were frozen so the city may do an environmental impact study.  Other cities – such as [[Nashville, Tennessee]], whose government is planning to demolish the downtown loop where three major interstates ([[I-65]], [[I-40]], and [[I-24]]) converge – are planning to replace these areas with parks, boulevards, and mixed-use communities that will reconnect their cores with adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="preservation"/&gt;

== Urban intensification ==
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Cheonggyecheon-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cheonggyecheon]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea was formerly the route for a major elevated highway; It was completed in 1976 and removed in 2005.]]
To counteract urban sprawl, some cities have made redevelopment plans around urban intensification. Urban intensification – also known as [[Compact City|Compact Cities]] in Europe – is an urban planning technique which promotes high residential density with mixed land uses based around an efficient public transport system. Typically, cities redevelop neighborhoods to concentrate growth in the center of the city with the goal of better land usage to support a high concentration of jobs and residents.  [[Smart growth]] principles and incentives generate residential, retail, and recreational development.  The purpose is to transform deteriorating, low-density commercial corridors into mixed-use corridors that focus around [[transit-oriented development]]. Cities have implemented plans to use intensification corridors functioning as [[boulevard]]s aimed at being transit supportive and pedestrian friendly, and provide\ a focus for higher density mixed-use development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Melissa |last= Shih |title= Municipal Conformity to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe: An Evaluation of Future Density Potential Along the Fairview Street Intensification Corridor in Burlington, Ontario |location= Kingston, ON |publisher= Queens University |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of transit oriented development along these corridors with subsequent increase in transit ridership has been well documented in neighborhoods such as [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]] and [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Urban Form Case Studies |publisher= Ontario Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cities, such as Portland Oregon, have implemented freeway removal policies to create intensification corridors.  Much of this began in the [[freeway and expressway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

== Boulevards and urban design ==
[[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] executed freeway removal projects that reduced traffic , spurred economic development, and allowed for the creation of new neighborhoods and commercial districts. The [[Harbor Drive]] Freeway in Portland was replaced by [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]], while the [[Park East Freeway]] in Milwaukee recovered prime land for development in the urban core.  In [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], the easternmost portion of the [[Gardiner Expressway]], which was located between Don Road and Leslie Street, was demolished in 2000 and replaced with an at-grade urban boulevard with traffic lights, railroad crossings and a [[bike trail]].

After acute damage to San Francisco's double-decked [[Embarcadero Freeway]] occurred during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] in 1989, it was demolished, but only after several years' wait &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Timeline-A-look-back-at-the-Embarcadero-2642356.php, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a boulevard flanked by the restored Beaux-Arts style Ferry Building.&lt;ref&gt;http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Embarcadero+Freeway+Removal, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underground relocation==
In some situations where removing an urban freeway would exacerbate traffic problems within a city, urban planners may resort to constructing [[tunnel]]s to relocate the freeway underground and reclaim the surface space previously occupied by the facility.

In [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the [[Central Artery]] ([[Interstate 93]]) ran through the center of the city on an elevated green viaduct from its opening in the 1950s until 2005.  The freeway divided historic neighborhoods and business districts in downtown Boston, and it was referred to as Boston's "other [[Green Monster]]."  During the 1990s and early 2000s, a $15 billion project known as the [[Big Dig]] relocated the Central Artery into tunnels underneath downtown Boston; the old viaduct was demolished, and its path was reclaimed for a surface boulevard and park space.

A similar project is underway to replace the crumbling [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, with [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel|a tunnel]] that will carry the [[Washington State Route 99|SR-99]] freeway underneath the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24506">'''GOMS''' is a specialized [[human information processor model]] for [[human-computer interaction]] observation that describes a user's cognitive structure on four components. In the book ''The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction''.&lt;ref name="psychology"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction|last=Card|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Card |author2=[[Thomas P. Moran]] |author3=[[Allen Newell]]|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1983|isbn=0-89859-859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1983 by [[Stuart K. Card]], [[Thomas P. Moran]] and [[Allen Newell]], the authors introduce: "a set of '''Goals''', a set of '''Operators''', a set of '''Methods''' for achieving the goals, and a set of '''Selections rules''' for choosing among competing methods for goals."&lt;ref name="psychology" /&gt;
GOMS is a widely used method by usability specialists for computer system designers because it produces quantitative and qualitative predictions of how people will use a proposed system.

==Overview==
[[File:Elements of a GOMS model.svg|thumb|The concepts behind a GOMS model and their relationships]]
A '''GOMS''' model is composed of methods that are used to achieve specific goals. These methods are then composed of operators at the lowest level. The operators are specific steps that a user performs and are assigned a specific execution time. If a goal can be achieved by more than one method, then selection rules are used to determine the proper Method.

* '''Goals''' are symbolic structures that define a state of affairs to be achieved and determinate a set of possible methods by which it may be accomplished
* '''Operators''' are elementary perceptual, motor or cognitive acts, whose execution is necessary to change any aspect of the user's mental state or to affect the task environment
* '''Methods''' describe a procedure for accomplishing a goal
* '''Selection Rules''' are needed when a goal is attempted, there may be more than one method available to the user to accomplish it.

There are several different GOMS variations which allow for different aspects of an interface to be accurately studied and predicted. For all of the variants, the definitions of the major concepts are the same. There is some flexibility for the designer's/analyst's definition of all of the entities. For instance, an operator in one method may be a goal in a different method. The level of granularity is adjusted to capture what the particular evaluator is examining.
For a simple applied example see [[#CMN-GOMS|CMN-GOMS]].

== Qualification ==

===Advantages ===

The '''GOMS''' approach to user modeling has strengths and weaknesses.
While it is not necessarily the most accurate method to measure human-computer interface interaction, it does allow visibility of all procedural knowledge. With GOMS, an analyst can easily estimate a particular interaction and calculate it quickly and easily. This is only possible if the average [[Methods-Time Measurement]] data for each specific task has previously been measured experimentally to a high degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="comparison"&gt;{{cite book|title=The GOMS Family of User Interface Analysis Techniques: Comparison and Contrast|last=John |first=Bonnie E. |author2=David E. Kieras |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|year=1996|location=[[United States of America]]|issn=1073-0516 |doi = 10.1145/235833.236054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages ===

'''GOMS''' only applies to skilled users. It does not work for beginners or intermediates for errors may occur which can alter the data.&lt;ref name="interaction"&gt;{{cite book|title=Interaction Design|last=Rogers|first=Yvonne |author2=Helen Sharp |author3=Jenny Preece|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2002|location=[[United States of America]]|isbn=0-471-49278-7|page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also the model doesn't apply to learning the system or a user using the system after a longer time of not using it.&lt;ref name="interaction" /&gt;
Another big disadvantage is the lack of account for errors, even skilled users make errors but GOMS does not account for errors.&lt;ref name = "interaction" /&gt;
Mental workload is not addressed in the model, making this an unpredictable variable. The same applies to fatigue.&lt;ref name = "interaction" /&gt;
GOMS only addresses the usability of a task on a system, it does not address its functionality.&lt;ref name = "interaction" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
User personalities, habits or physical restrictions (for example disabilities) are not accounted for in any of the GOMS models.  All users are assumed to be exactly the same. Recently some extensions of GOMS were developed, that allow to formulate GOMS models describing the interaction behavior of disabled users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Measuring website usability for visually impaired people – A modified GOMS analysis.

Moran]] |author3=[[Allen Newell]]|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1980|isbn=0-13-444910-X | doi = 10.1145/358886.358895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

Basically there are four different GOMS models: the [[Keystroke-Level Model]], [[CMN-GOMS]], [[NGOMSL]], [[CPM-GOMS]], and SGOMS.
Each model has a different complexity and varies in activities.

===KLM===

The [[Keystroke-Level Model]] ('''KLM''') is the first and simplest GOMS technique [[Stuart Card]], [[Thomas P. Moran]] and [[Allen Newell]] created.&lt;ref name="keystroke-level-model" /&gt;
Estimating an execution time for a task is done by listing the sequence of operators and then totaling the execution times for the individual operators. 
With KLM the analyst must specify the method used to accomplish each particular task instance. 
Furthermore, the specified methods are limited to being in sequence form and containing only keystroke-level primitive operators. 
The biggest difference between GOMS and [[Keystroke-level model|KLM]] is how time is assigned to cognitive and perceptual operators when it comes to execution time predictions.
Another major difference is that the goal-hierarchy is explicit in GOMS while it was implicit in the [[Keystroke-level model|KLM]].
The nature of unobservable operators is another important difference. [[Keystroke-level model|KLM]] has a single '''M''' operator that precedes each cognitive unit of action. In contrast, GOMS assigns no time to such cognitive overhead. But both models include '''M'''-like operators for substantial time-consuming mental actions such as locating information on the screen and verifying entries.
Both methods assign roughly the same time to unobservable perceptual and cognitive activities.
Also they make different assumptions about unobservable cognitive and perceptual operators and so distribute the time in different ways.&lt;ref name="comparison" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="technique"&gt;{{cite book|title=Using GOMS for User Interface Design and Evaluation: Which Technique?|last=John |first=Bonnie E. |author2=David E. Kieras |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|year=1996|location=[[United States of America]]|issn=1073-0516 | doi = 10.1145/235833.236050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KLM's execution part is described in four physical-motor operators:

* '''K'''  keystroking/ keypressing
* '''P'''  pointing with a mouse to a target
* '''H''' homing the hand on the keyboard
* '''D''' drawing a line segment on a grid

One mental operator '''M''' that stands for the time a user has to mentally prepare himself to do an action, and a system response operator '''R''' in with the user has to wait for the system.
Execution time is the sum of the times spent executing the different operator types:

''T''&lt;small&gt;execute&lt;/small&gt; = ''T''&lt;small&gt;K&lt;/small&gt; + ''T''&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt; + ''T''&lt;small&gt;H&lt;/small&gt; + ''T''&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; + ''T''&lt;small&gt;M&lt;/small&gt; + ''T''&lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name="psychology" /&gt;

Each of these operators has an estimate of execution time, either a single value, a parameterized estimate.

==== Touch Level Model (TLM) ====
GOMS and it variants were designed for keyboard interfaces, nowadays a new type of interface is omnipresent.
This addition to the GOMS family, together with updates to the existing KLM operators, is called the Touch Level Model (TLM). 
[[Andrew D. Rice]] and [[Jonathan W. Lartigue]] propose this model for the used to model human task performance on a constrained input touchscreen device and, with proper benchmarking, accurately predict actual user performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touch-level model (TLM): evolving KLM-GOMS for touchscreen and mobile devices|last=Rice|first=Andrew D.|author2=Jonathan W. Lartigue|publisher=ACM|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4503-2923-1 | doi = 10.1145/2638404.2638532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to provide an instrument for quantitative analysis of touchscreen interfaces.  &lt;br /&gt;
A number of operators are added for touchscreen interactions: 
*'''Distraction (X)''' a multiplicative operator that is applied to other operators to model real world distractions
*'''Gesture (G)''' gestures are conceptualized as specialized combinations of finger movements across the device's screen
*'''Pinch (P)''' refers to the common two-finger gesture  
*'''Zoom (Z)''' the reverse application of the Pinch operator. value in MS = 200 Ms
*'''Initial Act (I)''' KLM assumed the user is prepared to begin an action, touchscreen devices require users to prepare them for use (home button or password)
*'''Tap (T)'''  operator refers to the physical action of tapping an area on the touchscreen device in order to initiate some change or action
*'''Swipe (S)''' usually a horizontally or vertically swipe like changing the page in a book. value in MS = 70 Ms
*'''Tilt (L(d))''' used  with an interacting with  a devices equipped with accelerometers.
*'''Rotate (O(d))''' gesture in which two or more fingers are placed on the screen and then rotated about a central point
*'''Drag (D)''' similar to Swipe, Drag also involves tapping a location on the screen and then moving one or more fingers in specific direction

===CMN-GOMS===

'''CMN-GOMS''' is the original GOMS model proposed by [[Stuart Card]], [[Thomas P. Moran]] and [[Allen Newell]]. &lt;br /&gt;
CMN stands for Card, Moran and Newell and it takes the KLM as its basic and adds subgoals and selection rules.
This model can predict operator sequence as well as execution time. A CMN-GOMS model can be represented in program form, making it amenable to analysis as well as execution. 
CMN-GOMS has been used to model word processors &lt;ref name="psychology" /&gt; and CAD systems for ergonomic design(see [[#CAD|CAD]]).
&lt;ref name="comparison" /&gt; 
The CMN method can predict the operator sequence and the execution time of a task on a quantitative level and can focus its attention on methods to accomplish goals on a qualitative level. &lt;br /&gt;
In the example by [[Bonnie E. John]] and [[David E. Kieras]] a simple CMN-GOMS on editing a manuscript is shown.&lt;ref name="comparison" /&gt;

===NGOMSL===

'''NGOMSL''' is a structured natural language notation for representing GOMS models and a procedure for constructing them. 
This program form provides predictions of operator sequences, execution time and time to learn methods.
An analyst constructs an NGOMSL model by performing a top-down, breadth-first expansion of the user's top-level goals into methods, until the methods contain only primitive
operators, typically keystroke-level operators. 
This model explicitly represents the goal structure just like the CMN-GOMS and can so represent high-level goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=GOMS modeling of user interfaces using NGOMSL|last= Kieras |first=David|publisher=ACM|year=1994|isbn=0-89791-651-4 | doi = 10.1145/259963.260467}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

etc.
&lt;/small&gt;

===CPM-GOMS===

[[Bonnie E. John]] and [[David Kieras]] describe four different types of GOMS. CMN-GOMS, KLM and NGOMSL assume that all of the operators occur in sequence and do not contain operators that are below the activity level. 
CPM-GOMS being the fourth method uses operators at the level of [[Model Human Processor]] which assumes that operators of the cognitive processor, perceptual processor, and the motor processor can work in parallel to each other.
The most important point of CPM-GOMS is the ability to predict skilled behavior from its ability to model overlapping actions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Automating CPM-GOMS|last=John.|first=Bonnie E.|authorlink=Bonnie E. John |author2=Alonso Vera |author3=Michael Mattesa|publisher=ACM|year=2002|isbn=1-58113-453-3 | doi= 10.1145/503376.503404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SGOMS===

SGOMS stands for Sociotechnical GOMS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1= R. L. |last2= Nagy|first2= N.|date=2007 |title=Using GOMS for Modeling Routine Tasks Within Complex Sociotechnical Systems: Connecting Macrocognitive Models to Microcognition |url= |journal= Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1= R. L. |last2= Provnost|first2= S.|date=2009 |title= Modeling SGOMS in ACT-R: Linking Macro- and Microcognition |url= |journal= Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1= R. L. |last2= Macdougal|first2= W.|date=2015 |title= The Macro Architecture Hypothesis: Modifying Newell's System  Levels to Include Macro Cognition |url= |journal= Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created to allow GOMS to model work in complex sociotechnical systems. GOMS is meant to model an individual user, working in isolation, with no unexpected interruptions, similar to a Cognitive Psychology experiment. This level of analysis is sometimes referred to as ''microcognition'' to distinguish it from [[macrocognition]], which refers to real world cognition. SGOMS is meant to expand the applicability of GOMS to the macro cognitive level of analysis. To do this, SGOMS adds a high level control structure to GOMS, called the ''planning unit''. This allows GOMS to deal with unexpected interruptions. 

A planning unit is a list of unit tasks. Planning units can be ordered (the unit tasks must be done in order) or situated (the unit tasks in the list are done as the situation demands). Consistent with [[CPM-GOMS]], SGOMS assumes that the agent can monitor the situation in parallel in order to detect threats (neurophysiologically, this function is associated with the [[amygdala]]). Planning units can be interrupted and bookmarked so they can be resumed later. When a planning unit is interrupted the agent considers the situation and can resume the same planning unit or bookmark it and switch to a different planning unit. SGOMS does not prescribe how this choice is made but, if the decision is based on routine expertise, it can be included in the SGOMS model.

==Assumptions and Errors==

===Importance of Assumptions in GOMS Analysis===

Accurate assumptions are vital in GOMS analysis.  Before applying the average times for detailed functions, it is very important that an experimenter make sure he or she has accounted for as many variables as possible by using assumptions.  Experimenters should design their GOMS analysis for the users who will most likely be using the system which is being analyzed.  Consider, for example, an experimenter wishes to determine how long it will take an [[F22 Raptor]] pilot to interact with an interface he or she has used for years.  It can probably be assumed that the pilot has outstanding vision and is in good physical health.  In addition, it can be assumed that the pilot can interact with the interface quickly because of the vast hours of simulation and previous use he or she has endured.  All things considered, it is fair to use fastman times in this situation.  Contrarily, consider an 80-year-old person with no flight experience attempting to interact with the same [[F22 Raptor]] interface.  It is fair to say that the two people would have much different skill sets and those skill sets should be accounted for subjectively.

===Accounting for Errors===

The only way to account for errors in GOMS analysis is to predict where the errors are most likely to occur and measure the time it would take to correct the predicted errors.  For example, assume an experimenter thought that in typing the word "the" it was likely that a subject would instead incorrectly type "teh."  The experimenter would calculate the time it takes to type the incorrect word, the time it takes to recognize that a mistake has been made, and the time it takes to correct the recognized error.

==Applications of GOMS==

=== Workstation Efficiency ===
A successful implementation of CPM-GOMS was in ''Project Ernestine'' held by [[Verizon New England|New England Telephone]].  New ergonomically designed workstations were compared to old workstations in terms of improvement in telephone operators' performance.  CPM-GOMS analysis estimated a 3% decrease in productivity.  Over the four-month trial 78,240 calls were analysed and it was concluded that the new workstations produced an actual 4% decrease in productivity.  As the proposed workstation required less keystrokes than the original it was not clear from the time trials why the decrease occurred.  However CPM-GOMS analysis made it apparent that the problem was that the new workstations did not utilize the workers' slack time.  Not only did CPM-GOMS give a close estimate, but it provided more information of the situation.&lt;ref name="CHI92"&gt;{{cite conference|first=Wayne D.|last=Gray |author2=John, Bonnie E. |author3=Atwood, Michael E.| title=The Precis of Project Ernestine or an overview of a validation of GOMS|booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems|year=1992|doi=10.1145/142750.142821|isbn=0897915135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAD ===

GOMS models were employed in the redesign of a '''CAD''' ([[computer-aided design]]) system for industrial [[ergonomics]].&lt;ref name="Cad"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Validation of the GOMS Model Methodology in the Development of a Specialized, Commercial Software Application|last=Gong|first=Richard |author2=David Kieras |publisher=ACM|year=1994|isbn=0-89791-650-6 | doi = 10.1145/191666.191782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An applied GOMS model shows where the interface needs to be redesigned, as well as provides an evaluation of design concepts and ideas. 
In [[Richard Gong]]'s example, when GOMS revealed a frequent goal supported by a very inefficient method, he changed the method to a more efficient one. 
If GOMS showed that there were goals not supported by any method at all, then new methods were added. 
GOMS also revealed where similar goals are supported by inconsistent methods, a situation in which users are likely to have problems remembering what to do, and showed how to make the methods consistent.&lt;ref name="Cad" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">In [[marketing]], '''geomarketing''' (also called '''marketing geography''') is a discipline that uses [[geolocation]] ([[Geography|geographic]] information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the [[marketing mix]] – the product, price, promotion, or place ([[geo targeting]]).  [[Market segments]] can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing.

Geomarketing isapplied  in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp Geomarketing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080312045856/http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, [[Whois]] data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria.

[[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer.

==Geo marketing software==
[[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area.  It can be used to:
* Recommend nearby social events.&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level).
* Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; credit card information, VOIP address, etc.
* Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map.
* Locate a web client's computer on a digital map.
* Calculate summary information for specific areas.
* Select customers within specific areas.
* Select customers with a certain radius of a point.
* Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country.

Some of the software used includes [[Geoconcept]] Sales&amp;Marketing Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) [[GeoEdge]] (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful.

==Applications for Geo==

===Different content by choice===
Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/location-based-social-media-marketing/|title=Location Based Social Media Marketing|author=Lauren Wilson |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=22 August 2016|access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical example for different [[web content]] by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo —location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
Individuals can deliver different content in [[internet marketing]], through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical [[geolocation]] of the targeted audiences.

===Other applications===
* Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet
* Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management.
* Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers.
* Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations.
* Improve customer cooperation.
* Creation of sales territories

We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others.

With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field.

Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to [[comScore]], about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps.

One example of Geo Location is Google Maps - you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

[[File:Green Beard Effect.svg|thumb|upright|The Green-beard effect is a form of selection in which individuals with genes that produce unique observable traits select individuals with the specific trait and thereby the same gene. In this illustration individuals selectively mate with individuals of the same head color.]]

The '''green-beard effect''' is a [[thought experiment]] used in [[evolutionary biology]] to explain selective [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]] among individuals of a species. Altruistic behaviour is paradoxical when viewed in the light of old ideas of evolutionary theory that emphasised the role of competition. The evolution of altruism is better explained through the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], which emphasizes an interpretation of [[natural selection]] from the point of view of the [[gene]] which acts as an agent that has the metaphorical "selfish goal" of maximizing its own propagation. A gene for (behavioral) selective altruism can be favored by (natural) selection if the altruism is primarily directed at other individuals who share the gene. Since genes are invisible, such an effect requires perceptible markers for altruistic behaviour to occur.

A green-beard effect occurs when an [[allele]], or a set of [[Genetic linkage|linked]] alleles, produce three expressed (or [[phenotype|phenotypic]]) effects: 
*a perceptible [[Trait (biology)|trait]]&amp;mdash;the hypothetical "green beard"
*recognition of this trait by others; and
*preferential treatment of individuals with the trait

The carrier of the gene (or a specific allele) is essentially recognizing copies of the same gene (or a specific allele) in other individuals.  Whereas [[kin selection]] involves altruism to related individuals who share genes in a non-specific way, green-beard alleles promote altruism toward individuals who share a gene that is expressed by a specific phenotypic trait. Some authors also note that the green-beard effects can include "spite" for individuals lacking the "green-beard" gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Altruism, Spite, and Greenbeards|author1=West, Stuart A. | author2=Gardner, Andy| journal=Science| volume=327| year=2010| pages=1341–1344|url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/West&amp;Gardner_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have the effect of delineating a subset of organisms within a population that is characterized by members who show greater cooperation toward each other, this forming a "clique" that can be advantageous to its members who are not necessarily kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gardner, Andy|author2=West, Stuart A.|year=2010| volume=64| issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00842.x| pages=25–38| title=Greenbeards| journal=Evolution}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green-beard effect could increase altruism on green-beard phenotypes and therefore its presence in a population even if genes assist in the increase of genes that are not exact copies; all that is required is that they express the three required characteristics. Green-beard alleles are vulnerable to mutations that produce the perceptible trait without the helping behaviour.

The idea of a green-beard allele was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] in his articles of 1964,&lt;ref name="pmid5875341"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I | journal =  [[J Theor Biol]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=July 1964 | pmid = 5875341 | url = | doi =10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5875340"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. II | journal =  [[J Theor Biol]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–52 |date=July 1964 | pmid = 5875340 | url = | doi =10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and got the name from the example used by [[Richard Dawkins]] (''"I have a green beard and I will be altruistic to anyone else with green beard"'') in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="TheSelfishGene"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dawkins, Richard | title = The Selfish Gene | publisher = Oxford University Press, Oxford |isbn=0-19-217773-7 | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt;

==Examples==
Evolutionary biologists have debated the potential validity of green-beard genes, suggesting that it would be extraordinarily rare for a single or even a set of linked genes to produce three complex phenotypic effects. This criticism has led some to believe that they simply cannot exist or that they only can be present in less complex organisms, such as microorganisms. Several discoveries within the past ten years have illuminated the validity of this critique.

The concept remained a merely theoretical possibility under Dawkins' selfish gene model until 1998, when a green-beard allele was first found in nature, in the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'').&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt;&lt;ref name=invicta/&gt; [[Polygyne]] colony queens are [[heterozygous]] (Bb) at the Gp-9 gene locus. Their worker offspring can have both heterozygous (Bb) and [[homozygous]] (BB) genotypes. The investigators discovered that homozygous dominant (BB) queens, which in the wild form produce [[monogyne]] rather than polygyne colonies, are specifically killed when introduced into polygyne colonies, most often by heterozygous (Bb) and not homozygous (BB) workers. They concluded that the allele Gp-9&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is linked to a greenbeard allele which induces workers bearing this allele to kill all queens that do not have it. A final conclusion notes that the workers are able to distinguish BB queens from Bb queens based on an odor cue.&lt;ref name=invicta /&gt;

The gene csA in the [[slime mould]] ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', discovered in 2003,&lt;ref name=discoideum/&gt; codes for a [[cell adhesion]] protein which binds to gp80 proteins on other cells, allowing multicellular fruiting body formation on soil.  Mixtures of csA [[gene knockout|knockout]] cells with wild-type cells yield [[spores]], "born" from the fruiting bodies, which are 82% wild-type (WT).  This is because the wild-type cells are better at adhering and more effectively combine into aggregates; knockout (KO) cells are left behind.  On more adhesive but less natural substances, KO cells can adhere; WT cells, still better at adhering, sort preferentially into the stalk.&lt;ref name=discoideum /&gt;

In 2006, green beard-like recognition was seen in the cooperative behavior among color morphs in side-blotched lizards, although the traits appear to be encoded by multiple loci across the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid16651531"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinervo B, Chaine A, Clobert J, Calsbeek R, Hazard L, Lancaster L, McAdam AG, Alonzo S, Corrigan G, Hochberg ME | title = Self-recognition, color signals, and cycles of greenbeard mutualism and altruism | journal =  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue = 19 | pages = 7372–7377 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16651531 | url = | doi =10.1073/pnas.0510260103 | pmc = 1564281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example, found in 2008, is a gene that makes [[brewer's yeast]] clump together in response to a toxin such as alcohol.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; By investigating [[flocculation]], a type of self-adherence generally present in asexual aggregations, Smukalla ''et al.'' showed that ''S. cerevisiae'' is a model for cooperative behavior evolution. When this yeast expresses FLO1 in the laboratory, flocculation is restored.  Flocculation is apparently protective for the FLO1+ cells, which are shielded from certain stresses (ethanol, for example).  In addition FLO1+ cells preferentially adhere to each other.  The authors therefore conclude that flocculation is driven by this greenbeard allele.&lt;ref name=cerevisiae/&gt;

A mammalian example appears to be the reproductive strategy of the [[wood mouse]], which shows cooperation among spermatozoa. Single sperms hook in each other to form sperm-trains, which are able to move faster together than single sperm would do.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;

It has been suggested that [[speciation]] could be possible through the manifestation of a green-beard effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2003)057[0154:SMS]2.0.CO;2 |title=Socially mediated speciation| author1=Hochberg,  Michael E. |author2=Sinervo, Barry |author3=Brown, Sam P. | journal=Evolution| volume= 57|issue=1|pages=154–158| year=2003|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/classes/game_theory/HochbergEvo2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been pointed out that both the biological and cultural aspects of language are bestowed with green beard recognition systems, thus providing insights into the evolution of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2013-02-27|title=The green beards of language|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.506|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1104–1112|doi=10.1002/ece3.506|issn=2045-7758|pmc=3631417|pmid=23610647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Audodidact computer programmer [[Jeri Ellsworth]] at a 2009 Bay Area "Maker Faire" conference.]]
The '''history of women in engineering''' predates the development of the profession of engineering. Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors, such as [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. During the Islamic Golden Period from 8th Century until 15th Century along with men who were masters in Engineering, philosophy, mathematics, Science,Physics etc., there were also many muslim women who were inventors and engineers much before the european rennaisance. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852) was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor studied mathematics at Cambridge in the 1880s. [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first female engineers in Europe. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1906 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish Architectural Archive|title=PERRY, ALICE JACQUELINE|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4332/PERRY-ALICEJACQUELINE|website=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720-1940|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cociuban|first1=Anca|title=Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu – First female engineer in the world|url=http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|website=Amazing Romanians|accessdate=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208215432/http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces. The [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The Penn Stater |title=In Memoriam: Pilot and Physics Teacher |date=July–August 2013 |quote=Fenton...arrived at Penn State in 1942 as part of the '''Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program''', which was training women to replace male engineers who were fighting in World War II. [After] work[ing] at Curtiss-Wright, [she] enlist[ed] in the Navy, including a stint at...Wright-Patterson... She later taught physics at Cal State-Sacramento for 38 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name=Bix&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the [[ENIAC]]. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873. The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, from 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in [[computer science]] decreased by 23 percent.

==Terminology==
Although the terms [[engineer]] and [[engineering]] date from the Middle Ages, they acquired their current meaning and usage only recently in the nineteenth century. Briefly, an engineer is one who uses the principles of engineering – namely acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge – in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. Some of the major branches of the engineering profession include [[civil engineering]], [[military engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[computer engineering]], and [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= What is engineering and what do engineers do? | work= National Academy of Engineering website FAQ | url= http://www.nae.edu/About/FAQ/20650.aspx | accessdate= 2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventors==
Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. One of the earliest women inventors was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350? 370?–415), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. [[Tabitha Babbit]] (1784–1853?) was an American toolmaker who invented the first circular saw.  [[Sarah Guppy]] (1770–1852) was an Englishwoman who patented a design for bridge foundations. [[Mary Dixon Kies]] (1752–1837) was the first American woman to receive a patent for her method of weaving straw in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Autumn, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Invention'' (Metuchen, NJ and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century: entry into technical professions==
With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, new technology-based occupations opened up for both men and women. [[Sarah Bagley]] (1806–?) is remembered not only for her efforts to improved working conditions for women mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the 1830s and 1840s, but also for being one of the earliest women to work as a telegraph operator. [[Mathilde Fibiger]] (1830–1872), a Danish novelist and advocate of women's rights, became a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph system in the 1860s.

Engineering began to be taught as a formal academic discipline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[École Polytechnique]] in France was established in 1794 to teach military and civil engineering; [[West Point Military Academy]] in the United States established a program modeled after the École Polytechnique in 1819. [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) began to teach civil engineering in 1828. However, none of these institutions admitted women as students at the time of their founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= No. 1107: Engineering Education | author= John H. Lienhard | work= Engines of our Ingenuity | url= http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1107.htm | accessdate= 2011-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852), [[Lord Byron]]'s daughter, was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning the collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time.  Similarly, [[Mary Engle Pennington]] (1872–1952), an American chemist and refrigeration engineer, completed the requirements for a BS degree in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, but was given a certificate of proficiency instead.
[https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Morais_de_Sarmento Rita de Morais Sarmento] (1872–1931) was the first woman to obtain an Engineering degree from the Polytechnic Academy of Porto, in Portugal. She obtained this degree in 1894 and latter certified in 1896, which means she may have been the first formally recognised female engineer in Europe.
[[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first formally recognised female engineers in Europe. Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, she was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania. However, in 1909, she was accepted at the Royal Academy of Technology in Berlin. She graduated from the university in 1912, with a degree in engineering, specialising in chemistry, possibly becoming one of the first women engineers in the world. Other women in engineering in the same time period include three Danish women: Agnes Klingberg, Betzy Meyer, and Julie Arenholt, who graduated in 1897 and 1901 from 'Polyteknisk Læreanstalt', today known as the Danish Technical University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ida.dk/content/de-foerste-kvindelige-ingenioerer-agnes-og-betzy-pionerer|title=De første kvindelige ingeniører Agnes og Betzy - to pionerer|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Danish Society of Engineers, IDA website|work=|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female engineering graduate in Britain was [[Alice Perry]] who graduated from Queen's College, Galway in 1906.

Women without formal engineering degrees were also integral to great 19th century civil engineering feats. Emily Warren Roebling is recognized as managing the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was the first person to cross the bridge at its opening ceremony in 1883.&lt;ref name="asce.org"&gt;http://www.asce.org/templates/person-bio-detail.aspx?id=11203&lt;/ref&gt; Roebling's husband, Washington Roebling, worked as the chief engineer for the Brooklyn Bridge project until he fell ill of decompression sickness. Upon her husband's illness, Emily Warren Roebling assumed her husband's duties at the project site, and taught herself about material properties, cable construction, calculating catenary curves, and the like.&lt;ref name="asce.org"/&gt;

==20th century: entry into engineering programs==

In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. [[Nora Stanton Blatch Barney]] (1883–1971), daughter of [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and granddaughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], was the first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from [[Cornell University]] in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]; however, twelve years later, after having worked as an engineer, architect, and engineering inspector, her request for an upgrade to associate membership was denied. [[Olive Dennis]] (1885–1957), who became the second woman to graduate from Cornell with a civil engineering degree in 1920, was initially hired by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] as a draftsman; however, she later became the first person to claim the title of Service Engineer when this title was created.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1908 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"/&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"/&gt;

Edith Clarke, the inventor of the graphical calculator, was the first woman to earn a degree in MIT's electrical engineering department in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineergirl.org/Engineers/HistoricalEngineers/4399.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also became the first woman admitted to the American Institution of Electrical Engineers, the precursor to the IEEE. She taught at the University of Texas Austin, where she was the only woman faculty member in the engineering department.

==World War II engineering programs for women==

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces at the same time that industry ramped up production of armaments, battleships, and airplanes.  The U.S. Office of Education initiated a series of courses in science and engineering that were open to women as well as men.

Private programs for women included [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"/&gt;

[[Thelma Estrin]] (1924–2014 ), who would later become a pioneer{{Specify|reason=What did she pioneer?|date=July 2013}} in the fields of computer science and biomedical engineering, took a 1942 three-month engineering assistant course at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] and earned [[University of Wisconsin]] BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees.{{Dubious|reason=This anecdote that she took an engineering assistant course and earning 3 EE degrees doesn't seem to be wikinotable—what did Estrin DO AS AN ENGINEER?|date=July 2013}}

Through an accelerated program brought on by the war, [[Lois Graham]] (1925-2013) graduated from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rpi.edu/about/alumni/inductees/graham.html|title=Lois Graham, Engineering Education Leader|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (M.S. ME ’49, Ph.D. ’59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.iit.edu/news/2014/01/memoriam-lois-graham-ms-me-49-phd-59-iit-armour-college-engineering|title=In Memoriam – Lois Graham (M.S.

==Postwar era==

In 1943, the [[United States Army]] authorized a secret project at the University of Pennsylvania's [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] to develop an electronic computer to compute artillery firing tables for the Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]]. The project, which came to be known as [[ENIAC]], or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was completed in 1946.

Previous to the development of the ENIAC, the U.S. Army had employed women trained in mathematics to calculate artillery trajectories, at first using mechanical desk calculators and later the [[differential analyzer]] developed by [[Vannevar Bush]], at the Moore School. In 1945, one of these "computers", [[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC, together with  [[Frances Spence]] (1922– ), [[Betty Holberton]] (1917–2001), [[Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Ruth Lichterman]] (1924–1986), and [[Betty Jean Jennings]] (1924–2011). McNulty, Holberton, and Jennings would later work on the [[UNIVAC]], the first commercial computer developed by the [[Remington Rand Corporation]] in the early 1950s.

In 1946, [[Hattie Scott Peterson]] gained a degree in civil engineering, believed to be the first African-American woman to do so.&lt;ref name="California State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hattie Peterson (1913-1993)|url=http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409134822/http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html?utm_source=csl0613|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 April 2016|website=Library.ca.gov|publisher=California State Library|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to coeducation in engineering schools, 1950s–1970s==

The Cold War and the space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] created additional demands for trained engineering talent in the 1950s and 1960s. Many engineering schools in the U.S. that had previously admitted only male students began to tentatively adopt coeducation. After 116 years as an all-male institution, RPI began to admit small numbers of female students in the 1940s. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, but only in programs not available in other state universities. It would be 1968 before women were admitted to all courses offered by Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Terraso |first=David |title=Georgia Tech Celebrates 50 Years of Women |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology News Room |date=2003-03-21 |url=http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924111921/http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="females"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Cuneo|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3|title=Female faculty, staff offer professional perspectives|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110222125/http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3 |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873; she later became an instructor at MIT. However, until the 1960s, MIT enrolled few female engineering students, due in part to a lack of housing for women students. After the completion of the first women's dormitory on campus, McCormick Hall, in 1964, the number of women enrolled increased greatly.  Influenced in part by the [[second wave feminism]] movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, female faculty members at MIT, including [[Mildred Dresselhaus]] and [[Sheila Widnall]], began to actively promote the cause of women's engineering education.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus," 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972.

[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] is also notable for her contributions to computer and aerospace engineering in the 1970s. Hamilton, the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory at the time, is famous for her work in writing the on-board guidance code for the Apollo 11 mission.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@verne/margaret-hamilton-the-engineer-who-took-the-apollo-to-the-moon-7d550c73d3fa#.i1blqgw5r&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s–1990s==

As more engineering programs were opened to women, the number of women enrolled in engineering programs increased dramatically. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, during the period of 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent (from 37 percent of graduates in 1984 to 28 percent in 1994). This phenomenon became known as "The incredible shrinking pipeline," from the title of a 1997 paper on the subject by Dr. [[Tracy Camp]], a professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the [[Colorado School of Mines]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy, "The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 40 Nr. 10 (October 1997), 103–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reasons for the decline cited in the paper included:
* The development of computer games designed and marketed for males only;
* A perception that computer science was the domain of "hacker/nerd/antisocial" personality types;
* Gender discrimination in computing;
* Lack of role models at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, T., and Gurer, D., "Women in Computer Science: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going?" ''Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives.'' IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

===United States===
According to studies by the [[National Science Foundation]], the percentage of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased steadily from 0.4 percent in 1966 to a peak of 20.9 percent in 2002, and then dropped off slightly to 18.5 percent in 2008.  However, the trend identified in "The incredible shrinking pipeline" has continued; the percentage of BA/BS degrees in mathematics and computer science awarded to women peaked in 1985 at 39.5 percent, and declined steadily to 25.3 percent in 2008.

The percentage of master's degrees in engineering awarded to women increased steadily from 0.6 percent in 1966 to 22.9 percent in 2008. The percentage of doctoral degrees in engineering awarded to women during the same period increased from 0.3 percent to 21.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= S&amp;E Degrees: 1966–2008 | work= National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, National Science Foundation | url= https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf11316/content.cfm?pub_id=4062&amp;id=2 | accessdate= 2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Only 9.6% of engineers in Australia are women, and the rate of women in engineering degree courses has remained around 14% since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robogals.org/about/the-case-for-robogals&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digital home ap.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-priced Panasonic Home Theatre in a Box package, which consists of the DVD player, which contains an integrated multi-channel [[power amplifier]], and a set of speakers. The consumer must buy the [[television]] and stand separately.]]
A "'''home theater in a box'''" (HTIB) is an integrated [[home cinema|home theater]] package which "bundles" together a combination  [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a [[surround sound]] decoder, a [[radio tuner]], and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a [[remote control]], a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as "2.1") and a low-frequency [[subwoofer]] cabinet.
In 2016,
they are manufactured by most makers of [[consumer electronics]]. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price "house" brands (e.g., [[Best Buy]]'s ''Insignia'' line) may be a "2.1" system. Many, however, are a full "[[5.1]]" system and some higher-end packages even have a [[7.1]] system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are [[RCA]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[LG Corp|LG]] and [[Samsung]], all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] and [[Onkyo]] make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.

==Market positioning==
HTIBs are marketed as an "all-in-one" way for consumers to enjoy the [[surround sound]] experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics "know-how" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include [[HDMI cable]]s, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.

On the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and "tweakability" of [[home cinema|home theater]] components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a [[Audio crossover|crossover]] control, a phase inversion switch, and a [[parametric equalizer]], a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too "boomy" in a room.

==Features==
A typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a [[subwoofer]]. Some HTIB systems also have a [[radio tuner]] or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. [[Spotify]]). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a [[television set]] or [[video monitor|monitor]] with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with [[HDMI]] with ARC, optical and [[SPDIF]] inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.

There are systems in this class that are sold without a [[DVD Video|DVD]] player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the "receiver-only" packages that do not come with a DVD player.

Some HTIBs use [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation.  However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by [[manufacturer]]s to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.

A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the [[surround speakers]] in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.

Some older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a [[hard disk]] for recording TV shows.

They can be [[benign tumor|benign]] or [[malignant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms - Benign|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There are four main groups of vaginal neoplasms: benign neoplasms, [[Carcinoma in situ|in situ neoplasms]], malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as [[cancers]]. ''Tumor'' ([[American English]]) or ''tumour'' ([[British English]]), Latin for ''swelling'', one of the cardinal signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses ''tumor'' as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic [[lesion]] that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include [[leukemia]] and most forms of [[carcinoma in situ]]. ''Tumor'' is also not synonymous with ''[[cancer]].'' While cancer is by definition malignant, a tumor can be [[Benign tumor|benign]], [[Precancerous condition|precancerous]], or [[Malignancy|malignant]]}} A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that usually forms a tissue mass.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Lost artworks''' are original pieces of art that credible sources indicate once existed but that cannot be accounted for in museums or private collections or are known to have been [[Iconoclasm|destroyed deliberately]] or accidentally, or neglected through ignorance and lack of [[connoisseurship]].

The US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] maintains a list of "Top Ten Art Crimes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft|title=FBI — Art Theft|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2006 book by Simon Houpt&lt;ref name="Houpt2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houpt |first=Simon |title=Museum of the Missing: The High Stakes of Art Crime |year=2006 |publisher=Key Porter Books |isbn=978-1-86189-316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other media outlets have profiled the most significant outstanding losses.

==Chronology of notable loss events==
&lt;!-- Consistent and concise format is: Identifying place proper name as indicated elsewhere on English wiki (should be linked out to that page) followed by a 1-2 word event-type descriptor ("fire", "theft") then comma plus the most specific date possible in euro format: "Gosford House fire, 1940". Use a geographic designation only to differentiate between places with exactly the same name (i.e. Museum of Modern Art). If event has a globally recognized standard name (i.e. "Bonfire of the Vanities" that supersedes this convention) ---&gt;

== Research and recovery efforts ==

The [[Art Loss Register]] is a commercial computerized international database which captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques and collectables. It is operated by a commercial company based in London.

In the U.S., the FBI maintains the [https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|National Stolen Art File], "a database of stolen art and cultural property. Stolen objects are submitted for entry to the NSAF by law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad."&lt;ref name="FBI20160930"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Stolen Art File|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|website=fbi.gov|publisher=FBI|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of search and recovery efforts were created in response to major loss events, notably:
*[[Monuments Men|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program ("Monuments Men"), 1943–1946]]
*[[World War II looting of Poland#Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art|Bureau of Revindication and Damages (Poland), operated from 1945 to 1951]]
*[[World War II looting of Poland#Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art|Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad, 1991-]]

{{main|Vincent van Gogh}}
The events that befell the early '''paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh''' in the period prior to the posthumous recognition of [[Vincent van Gogh]] (1853 – 1890) as an innovative artist show how the appreciation of his legacy changed [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|his reputation]] in a relatively short time.

A part of the work that remained with his family when he left the Netherlands must be considered '''[[Lost artworks|lost]]''', and the remaining [[early works of Vincent van Gogh]] tell an incomplete story. Van Gogh himself wrote that he had stored some 70 painted studies in the attic of his studio when he left The Hague, but only some 25 of these are now known.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Letter 391" &gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 391: To Theo van Gogh. Hoogeveen, Friday, 28 September 1883|url= http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let391/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= Note 8|quote= I have more than 70 painted studies lying in The Hague ...|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those involved in the early trade have been interviewed by journalists and art researchers, but the literature on Van Gogh relies and focuses largely on his [[List of works by Vincent van Gogh|known existing work]].

== To Breda ==
[[File:WLANL - artanonymous - Stilleven met bijbel.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Bible'', 1885, Nuenen.]]
The father of Vincent van Gogh, the [[Nuenen]] pastor [[Van Gogh's family in his art#Theodorus van Gogh|Theo van Gogh]], died unexpectedly on 26 March 1885. Vincent moved to Antwerp on November 27. In the following months his mother, Anna-Cornelia van Gogh-Carbentus, decided to move to a smaller home for her and her daughter [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]. They found an upper part of a house on the corner of the Nieuwe Ginnekenstraat and Wapenplein (nowadays Van Coothplein 33 A) in [[Breda]] and moved there on 30 March 1886 (coincidentally Vincent's 33rd birthday).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Vincent's mother had a part of the furniture, including Vincent's possessions, stored because the new house had insufficient space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jo van Gogh-Bonger's Memoir of Vincent van Gogh|url=http://www.vggallery.com/misc/archives/jo_memoir.htm|publisher=vggallery.com|quote=When in May his mother also left Nuenen, everything belonging to Vincent was packed in cases, left in the care of a carpenter in Breda and--forgotten! After several years the carpenter finally sold everything to a junk dealer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ended up in a warehouse owned by a carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen, living in the Ginnekenstraat. When the furniture and boxes were later retrieved, Vincent's sister Wil discovered traces of [[woodworm]] in the crates and it was decided to leave it with Schrauwen in the attic.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stockvis|first=Benno J.|title=Letter from Benno J. Stokvis to n/a Breda, 1926|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/15/etc-A13a.htm%20Lost%20works|publisher=WebExhibits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Rubbish" of Vincent ==
In the period from November 1885 until the end of February 1886, Vincent wrote from Antwerp to his brother Theo in Paris various letters about the upcoming move in March 1886 of his mother and sister. He wondered if he had to help with arrangements in Nuenen. Vincent went to Paris at the end of February 1886 and he did not help his family with packing. When the family moved, the things that Vincent had left behind when he went to Antwerp, including wood engravings and books, were stored in a carpenter's attic in Breda. The carpenter's name was Adrianus Schrauwen. In a letter from Arles to his sister Wil from June 1888 Vincent writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh. Arles, between Saturday, 16 and Wednesday, 20 June 1888|at= note 9|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let626/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Speaking of rubbish... It is perhaps worth saving what is good among the rubbish which, as Theo says, is still in an attic somewhere in Breda. I dare not ask, however, and perhaps it is lost, so do not worry about it.

According to specialist researcher [[Jan Hulsker]] in his book ''Van Gogh door Van Gogh'' (1973) the word rubbish refers not to Vincent's own work, but to books and woodcuts, illustrations which he had taken from magazines and such. In a postscript of a letter in early August 1888, Vincent asks Wil to bring him some wood engravings and prints that had remained in Breda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Sunday, 15 July 1888|at= note 12|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let642/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of Schrauwen ==
This could mean that Vincent considered his work in the attic at Schrauwen lost. In any case, in 1888 Theo and Wil knew of belongings that had been left behind in Breda. In a letter from Vincent to Wil (end of October 1889) he says that Wil and her mother would move shortly thereafter to Leiden. The population register in Breda mentions that the move took place on November 2, 1889. On this basis, it is assumed that in the beginning of November 1889 his mother and Wil reclaimed their possessions from Schrauwen, but left Vincent's boxes because of the alleged woodworm.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

Stokvis writes in his ''Research about Vincent van Gogh in Brabant'' (Nasporingen omtrent Vincent van Gogh in Brabant, 1926) on page 27:

:At the request of the old Mrs Van Gogh one of the sisters Begemann (in Nuenen) had a part of what had been left behind in the studio, packed in boxes and sent to carpenter Schrauwen in Breda after the departure of the family.

Years later, Schrauwen considered himself the rightful owner of the boxes because nobody had ever picked them up, he broke them open, took the folders with drawings, sketches and watercolors, and used the wood for various other purposes.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;

== Role of Couvreur ==
Seventeen years later, in 1903, Schrauwen invited a market merchant Mr. J.C. Couvreur to sell some belongings, such as a small can, a pot and other kitchen equipment. Couvreur offered 2.50 guilders and Schrauwen accepted on condition that he also take the rubbish which he had stored in his attic for so long. Couvreur agreed and stored the approximately sixty paintings, one hundred and fifty loose canvases, eighty pen drawings and between one hundred and two hundred chalk drawings in the basement of his house in the Stallingstraat in Breda.&lt;ref name= "Stockvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peasant and peasant woman planting potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Planting Potatoes'', April 1885, Nuenen.]]
[[File:Basket of Potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|''Still Life with Potatoes'', September 1885, Nuenen.]]
He spoke of this in an article in the newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' on 25 April 1938:

:So I had those things in the basement, higgledy-piggledy, my wife looked there every now and then, flipped through the drawings and saw many nude studies. She said to me: That I do not want to have in my house, it must go. I said: you can never know what those things may turn out to be worth, but my wife said: those things go out the door or I go out the door. In such a case, things go out the door. So I went into my basement one day, picked up all drawings that were somewhat offensive, put them in a big bag and when that bag was full, I brought it to the paper factory of Tilburg to be ground to paper; I've had a few dimes for it. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

After clearing his basement of the bags with nude drawings, Couvreur wanted to get rid of the remaining pictures as well and he approached a Rotterdam paintings merchant, called De Winter, who thought it was worthless, according to Couvreur in an article on 18 February 1950 in the Breda newspaper ''De Stem''. Couvreur also delivered some paintings to Frans Meeuwissen, the owner of the café at the corner of Ginnekenstraat and Stallingstraat, who sold them or gave them away to customers. If someone offered Couvreur a beer, he could have a Van Gogh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Van Gogh's for a dime ===
Couvreur was planning on selling the remaining canvases and drawings on the market, he tells in a ''Telegraaf'' newspaper article:

:I have stood on the market with a cart for thirty years. I pinned the drawings and paintings of Van Gogh on the cart and anyone could have one for ten cents. Sometimes I gave them to the children on the street to play with. One of those pieces I had to buy back later for seventy-five guilders. I was now gradually getting rid of the items in the basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to his story one day on his way to the market in the Ginnekenstraat the tailor C. Mouwen approached him to buy some paintings. Couvreur sold him six canvases for ten cents each. Later in the day a maid of Mouwen came and asked if she could have another six for the same price.

:My wife says: now don't be silly, he does not do it for fun, those things are worth more that. You need to ask not one, but two dimes apiece. I said to the girl: thank Mr. Mouwen and tell him he can get six for two dimes apiece. The girl went away, came back and said that Mr. Mouwen would not go higher than 35 cents per piece. I quickly sold them for thirty-five cents per piece.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In a short time the amounts went tenfold, and then again:

:Then one morning comes which I shall never forget. Coincidentally I get a newspaper in my hands and I see that Van Gogh is a [[posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|famous painter]]. Well, I thought, now I understand how that Mr. Mouwen could make me earn 25 cents on a painting! I spoke with him and we agreed that I would try to find the people to whom I had sold paintings for a dime and fifteen cents, and ask them to sell the pictures back. We have been busy with that for a while. For example, there was a farmer who had two pieces of me. I went to the man and said: can I have them back for a two and half guilders? And he gave them for 2.50 guilders. ... It was a strange story. To get them back I had to pay fifty, sixty, seventy guilders to the parents of the children to whom I had sold those paintings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The majority of the retrieved works was bought by C. Mouwen, who loaned some fifty paintings for an exhibition with [[art dealer]] Oldenzeel in Rotterdam in January 1903 and sold 25 paintings at an auction on 3 May 1904, and an unknown number went to his cousin W. van Bakel, lecturer at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Because the names of the buyers have not all been recorded, traces of early works by Van Gogh continued to get lost until the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Breda Museum's ''Lost and Found'' exhibition ==

Breda Museum hosted an exhibition called ''Vincent van Gogh: Lost and Found'' between November 2003 and February 2004. The show-piece of the exhibition was a painting ''Houses near the Hague'',  which the museum claimed had been authenticated by their experts as painted by Vincent on the basis of x-ray analysis. The painting had come from the so-called Marijnissen collection of Barend den Houter, a tax official at Breda. This collection had formerly been examined by experts in 1940 and declared unimportant, consisting of forgeries or work by little known contemporaries. However, Breda Museum said they had uncovered a connection between den Houter and Vincent's mother. The [[Van Gogh Museum]] said they were sceptical about the authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alleged newly discovered van Gogh|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3541333/ns/today-entertainment/t/alleged-newly-discovered-van-gogh/#.T1lRjXmO4rU|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=12 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement in response to questions raised by the exhibition 'Lost and Found' at the Breda's Museum|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=8000&amp;lang=en|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|date=18 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie (2004) pp. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the [[University of Toronto]] in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

McLuhan is known for coining the expression "[[the medium is the message]]"&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; and the term [[global village]], and for predicting the [[World Wide Web]] almost 30 years before it was invented.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt; He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plummer|first=Kevin|title=Historicist: Marshall McLuhan, Urban Activist|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/06/historicist_marshall_mcluhan_urban_activist/|publisher=www.torontoist.com|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles.&lt;ref name="stille"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/arts/marshall-mcluhan-back-dustbin-history-with-internet-his-ideas-again-seem-ahead.html|title=Marshall McLuhan Is Back From the Dustbin of History; With the Internet, His Ideas Again Seem Ahead of Their Time|last=Stille|first=Alexander| date=14 October 2000|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] interest was renewed in his work and perspective.&lt;ref name="guard08"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/feb/28/livinginmarshallmcluhansga|title=Living in Marshall McLuhan's galaxy|last=Beale|first=Nigel|date=28 February 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2011|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boxer"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/03/arts/critic-s-notebook-mcluhan-s-messages-echoing-on-iraq.html?scp=12&amp;sq=mcluhan&amp;st=nyt|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; McLuhan's Messages, Echoing On Iraq|last=Boxer| first=Sarah|date=3 April 2003|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to Elsie Naomi ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. "Marshall" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a [[Baptist]] school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when [[World War I]] broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian army]]. After a year of service, he contracted [[influenza]] and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending [[Kelvin High School|Kelvin Technical School]] before enrolling in the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to "gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edan, Tina (2003).

He had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate "affiliated" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 40; McLuhan later commented  "One advantage we Westerners have is that we're under no illusion we've had an education.

Leavis]] and was influenced by [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the ''training of perception'' and such concepts as Richards' notion of ''[[I.

After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a lifelong interest in the number three&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the trivium, the [[Trinity]]) and sometimes said that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] provided intellectual guidance for him.&lt;ref&gt;Associates speculated about his intellectual connection to the Virgin Mary, one saying, "He had a direct connection with the Blessed Virgin Mary.... He alluded to it very briefly once, almost fearfully, in a please-don't-laugh-at-me tone. He didn't say, 'I know this because the Blessed Virgin Mary told me,' but it was clear from what he said that one of the reasons he was so sure about certain things was that the Virgin had certified his understanding of them." (cited in Marchand, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at [[Saint Louis University]] (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on [[Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and tutored and befriended [[Walter J. Ong]], who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

While the McLuhans were in England, [[World War II|war]] had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  He next taught at [[Assumption University (Windsor)|Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] from 1944 to 1946, then moved to [[Toronto]] in 1946 where he joined the faculty of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], a Catholic college of the [[University of Toronto]]. [[Hugh Kenner]] was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar [[Harold Innis]] was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.  McLuhan wrote in 1964: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of [[writing]] then of [[printing]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall.

This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man|The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] also produced an important journal called ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Prins and Bishop 2002&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]], together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]]. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] on the subject of [[Wyndham Lewis]]. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan was named to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair in Humanities at [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx for one year (1967–68).&lt;ref&gt;During the time at Fordham University, his son [[Eric McLuhan]] conducted what came to be known as the [[Fordham Experiment]] about the different effects of "light-on" versus "light-through" media.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in [[Wychwood Park]], a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where [[Anatol Rapoport]] was his neighbour.  In 1970, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[University of Dallas]] hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan (n.d.).

Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&amp;T among them.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-winning motion picture ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, "You know nothing of my work."

In September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.&lt;ref name=nytimesobituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Marshall McLuhan, Author, Dies; Declared 'Medium Is the Message'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-obit.html|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
During his years at [[Saint Louis University]] (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral [[doctoral thesis|dissertation]] and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'', which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts ([[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]—collectively known as the [[trivium]]) from the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's doctoral dissertation from 1942 was published by [[Gingko Press]] in March 2006. Gingko Press also plans to publish the complete manuscript of items and essays that McLuhan prepared, only a selection of which were published in his book. With the publication of these two books a more complete picture of McLuhan's arguments and aims is likely to emerge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the ''trivium'' to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the [[Late Middle Ages]], for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the [[Renaissance]] was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the [[New Criticism]] of Richards and Leavis.&lt;ref&gt;For a nuanced account of McLuhan's thought regarding Richards and Leavis, see McLuhan's "Poetic and Rhetorical Exegesis: The Case for Leavis against Richards and Empson" in the ''Sewanee Review'', volume 52, number 2 (1944): 266–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mechanical Bride'', McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary [[popular culture]]. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of [[mass media|communication media]] independent of their content. His famous [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'') calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "the medium is the message" may be better understood in light of [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s further articulation of related ideas: at the empirical level of [[consciousness]], the medium is the message, whereas at the intelligent and rational levels of consciousness, the content is the message. This sentence uses Lonergan's terminology from ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' to clarify the meaning of McLuhan's statement that "the medium is the message"; McLuhan read this when it was first published in 1957 and found "much sense" in it—in his letter of September 21, 1957, to his former student and friend, Walter J. Ong, S.J., McLuhan says, "Find much sense in Bern. Lonergan's ''Insight''" (''Letters of Marshall McLuhan'', 1987: 251). Lonergan's ''Insight'' is an extended guide to "making the inward turn": attending ever more carefully to one's own consciousness, reflecting on it ever more carefully, and monitoring one's articulations ever more carefully.  When McLuhan declares that he is more interested in [[percept]]s than [[concept]]s, he is declaring in effect that he is more interested in what Lonergan refers to as the empirical level of consciousness than in what Lonergan refers to as the intelligent level of consciousness in which concepts are formed, which Lonergan distinguishes from the rational level of consciousness in which the adequacy of concepts and of predications is adjudicated. This inward turn to attending to percepts and to the cultural conditioning of the empirical level of consciousness through the effect of communication media sets him apart from more outward-oriented studies of sociological influences and the outward presentation of self carried out by [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]], [[Kenneth Burke]], Hugh Duncan, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan also started the journal ''Explorations'' with anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund "Ted" Carpenter]]. In a letter to [[Walter Ong]] dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plummer | first=Kevin | date=May 3, 2014 | title=Historicist: ''Explorations'' at the Vanguard of Communications Studies |  work=[[Torontoist]] | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/historicist-explorations-at-the-vanguard-of-communications-studies/ | access-date=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, [[Tom Wolfe]] suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the "[[noosphere]]".&lt;ref name="TWolfe"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPmRPa7ls | title = Tom Wolfe on Media, Advertising, Technology (1999) | accessdate = 23 April 2017 | last = Wolfe | first = Tom | date = December 2015 | publisher = C-SPAN | quote = 45m}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): "This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence."

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: "I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies." Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: "The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ .... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community."&lt;ref name="AChrystall"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/778 | title = The New American Vortex (2007)| accessdate = 24 Jun 2018 | last = Chrystall | first = Andrew | date = December 2007 | publisher = Massey University | quote = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
McLuhan's first book, ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man]]'' (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the [[Dada]]ist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]].

Like his 1962 book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', ''The Mechanical Bride'' is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the "mosaic approach" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.

=== ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962) ===
McLuhan's ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]].

Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Movable type ====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] replaces [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm |publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) |title=The source of the term 'global village' |author=Eric McLuhan |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies".&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented almost thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as  its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getto |first=Erica |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/jul/15/celebrating-marshall-mcluhans-legacy/ |title=The Medium is the Massage: Celebrating Marshall McLuhan's Legacy |publisher=WNYC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Levinson | url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 |first=Paul|last=Levinson |title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-19251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Medeasfhsdl.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Book cover ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' by Marshall McLuhan, 1964. It is the source of the phrase [[The medium is the message]].]] --&gt;

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world "we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

==== {{anchor|Hot and cool media}}"Hot" and "cool" media ====
In the first part of ''Understanding Media,'' McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were "hot"—that is, they enhance one single [[sense]], in this case [[Visual perception|vision]], in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with "cool" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and [[comics]], which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be "hot", intensifying one single sense "high definition", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be "cool" and "low definition", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include [[radio]], as well as [[film]], the [[lecture]], and [[photography]].

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include [[television]], as well as the [[seminar]] and [[cartoons]]. McLuhan describes the term "cool media" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean "detached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-342-1818/people/mcluhan/clip4 |title=CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an "extension of ourselves." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Playboy Interview|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|date=March 1969|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

==== Critiques of ''Understanding Media'' ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word "medium" for being too simplistic.  [[Umberto Eco]], for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;{{cite web|last=Debray|first=Regis|title=Media Manifestos|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Debray-MediaManifestos1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Media Manifestos'', [[Régis Debray]] also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium.  Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary "public" for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious "mana"; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.&lt;ref name="Debray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, when ''Wired'' interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan "more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ...  McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyne|first=Andrew|title=Debray on Technology|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdebray1.htm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Macdonald]], in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his "aphoristic" style of prose, which he believes left ''Understanding Media'' filled with "contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness." &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen|first=Megan|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw: Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media|url=http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105045526/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|archivedate=5 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Brian Winston]]’s ''Misunderstanding Media'', published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] stances.&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]] and [[James W. Carey]] further this point of contention, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Carr states that there has been a long line of "academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem," whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Marshall McLuhan: Media Savant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Carr-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 November 2011|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as "probes" or "mosaics" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grossweiler, ''The Method is the Message: Rethinking McLuhan through Critical Theory'' (Montreal: Black Rose, 1998), 155-81&lt;/ref&gt; and suitability for virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levinson, ''Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium'' (New York: Routledge,1999), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Medium Is the Massage:&lt;!-- "MASSAGE" IS CORRECT, EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: "The Medium is the MASSAGE" is the correct title. Please DO NOT change "Massage" to "Message" here --&gt; An Inventory of Effects'' (1967) ===
''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'', published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller,&lt;ref name="wired saint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/saint.marshal.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= |title=The Wisdom of Saint Marshall, the Holy Fool |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by [[Quentin Fiore]],&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  McLuhan adopted the term "massage" to denote the effect each medium has on the human [[sensorium]], taking inventory of the "effects" of numerous media in terms of how they "massage" the sensorium.&lt;ref&gt;According to McLuhan biographer W. Terrence Gordon, "by the time it appeared in 1967, McLuhan no doubt recognized that his original saying had become a cliché and welcomed the opportunity to throw it back on the compost heap of language to recycle and revitalize it.  But the new title is more than McLuhan indulging his insatiable taste for puns, more than a clever fusion of self-mockery and self-rescue—the subtitle is 'An Inventory of Effects,' underscoring the lesson compressed into the original saying." (Gordon, p. 175.)

However, the FAQ section on the website maintained by McLuhan's estate says that this interpretation is incomplete and makes its own leap of logic as to why McLuhan left it as is. "Why is the title of the book ''The Medium Is the Massage'' and not ''The Medium is the Message''? Actually, the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter's, it had on the cover 'Massage' as it still does. The title was supposed to have read ''The Medium is the Message'' but the typesetter had made an error. When McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, 'Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!' Now there are possible four readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: ''Message'' and ''Mess Age'', ''Massage'' and ''Mass Age''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page.  The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from "reading" typographic print to "scanning" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on the human sensorium.

In ''The Medium Is the Massage'',&lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt; McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''—that all media are "extensions" of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] by typography, while "[t]he technique of the [[suspension of judgement|suspended judgment]] is the discovery of the twentieth century", brought on by the [[bard]] abilities of radio, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a [[rear-view mirror]]. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in [[Bonanza]]-land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medium is the Massage'', pp 74,5&lt;/ref&gt;

An audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan ''interrupted'' by other speakers, including people speaking in various [[phonation]]s and [[falsetto]]s, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media.  McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording "the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I wouldn't be seen dead with a living work of art."—'Old man' speaking
:"Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey."—'Middle aged man' speaking

=== ''War and Peace in the Global Village'' (1968) ===
McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves [[portmanteau]]s of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== ''From Cliché to Archetype'' (1970) ===
In his 1970 book, ''From Cliché to Archetype'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]],&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wilfred-watson/ |title=Watson, Wilfred |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202212727/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008487 |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the various implications of the verbal [[cliché]] and of the [[archetype]].  One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the ''global theater''.

In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.

An example of this given by McLuhan is [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'', whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an [[Assimil]] language book. "Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's ''archetype'' "is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment." "Environment" would also include the kinds of "awareness" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context [[Carl Jung]] described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a "doubleness":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another theme of the Wake [''[[Finnegans Wake]]''] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of [[hendiadys]] dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Theater of the Absurd]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "languages of the heart", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which "ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term ''global theater''. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

=== ''The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century'' (1989) ===
In his 1989 posthumous book, ''The Global Village'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Bruce R. Powers]], provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the [[Shannon–Weaver model]]. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow"&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.

Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. "Comprehensive awareness" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.

McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'', an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: "Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.

A third term of ''The Global Village'' that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's Laws of the Media, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." &lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==

=== Tetrad of media effects ===
{{Main|Tetrad of media effects}}

In ''Laws of Media'' (1988), published posthumously by his son [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], McLuhan summarized his ideas about [[media studies|media]] in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor [[Harold Innis]] in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the ''Enhancement'' and ''Retrieval'' qualities of the medium, both ''Figure'' qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the ''Obsolescence'' and ''Reversal'' qualities, both ''Ground'' qualities.&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Eric |title=Electric language: understanding the present |publisher=Stoddart |year=1998 |isbn=0-7737-5972-7}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|right|thumb|250px|A blank tetrad diagram]]

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. ''Radio amplifies news and music via sound.''
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. ''Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.''
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. ''Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.''
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. ''Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.''

=== Figure and ground ===
{{Main|Figure and ground (media)}}

McLuhan adapted the [[Gestalt psychology]] idea of a ''figure and a ground'', which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message".&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium  or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

[[File:Marshall McLuhan Way Toronto.jpg|thumb|A portion of Toronto's St. Joseph Street is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way]]
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial.{{According to whom|date=January 2013}} This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, [[Howard Gossage]] and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of "genius scouting."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marchand, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (1994). ''Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign''. NY: Vintage Books, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', any time he needed it.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a "McLuhan festival" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this "festival", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of [[Tom Wolfe]], who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, "What If He Is Right?", published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and Wolfe's own ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only "probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. ''Newsweek'' magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in ''Life Magazine'', ''Harper's'', ''Fortune'', ''Esquire'', and others. Cartoons about him appeared in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;  In 1969, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published a lengthy interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan |date=March 1969 |work=Playboy |pages=26–27, 45, 55–56, 61, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', the "poet" [[Henry Gibson]] would randomly say, "Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase ''[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]'' by its popularizer, [[Timothy Leary]], in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. ''Everybody Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 337–38&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced [[cultural criticism|cultural critics]], thinkers, and media theorists such as [[Neil Postman]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Hugh Kenner]], and [[John David Ebert]], as well as political leaders such as [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-342-1826/life_society/mcluhan/clip8 |title=It's cool not to shave – Marshall McLuhan, the Man and his Message – CBC Archives |accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Jerry Brown]]. [[Andy Warhol]] was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous "[[15 minutes of fame]]" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in [[Angola]], he suggested a massive spread of TV devices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]], interview at [[RAI Radio1]] show ''[http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm Stereonotte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015942/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm |date=2007-06-29 }}'', July 01 2007 2:00 am. Quote: "McLuhan era uno che al premier canadese che si interrogava su un modo per sedare dei disordini in Angola, McLuhan disse, negli anni 70, 'riempite la nazione di apparecchi televisivi'; ed è quello che venne fatto; e la rivoluzione in Angola cessò." {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character "Brian O'Blivion" in [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1983 film [[Videodrome]] is a "media oracle" based on McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, Elena. ''Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic: Probing the Literary Origins of Media Studies.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, McLuhan was named as the "patron saint" of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired Magazine'']] and a quote of his appeared on the masthead{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} for the first ten years of its publication.&lt;ref name="wired channel" /&gt; He is mentioned by name in a [[Peter Gabriel]]-penned lyric in the song "Broadway Melody of 1974".  This song appears on the [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', from [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].  The lyric is:  "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand."  McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' entitled "[[House Arrest (The Sopranos episode)|House Arrest]]". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a ''Wired'' mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for ''Wired'' that "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective."&lt;ref name="wired channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling.html |title=Channeling McLuhan |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new centre known as the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]], formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Since 1994, it has been part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education|OISE]] Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of [[York University]] served Director of the Program.
In 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was [[Seamus Ross]] (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202736/http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Toronto, [[Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School]] is named after him.

The '''men who have sex with men blood donor controversy''' is the dispute over prohibitions on donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant]]s from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification of men who engage (or have engaged in the past) in sex with other men, regardless of whether they identify themselves as [[bisexual]], [[gay]], or otherwise. Restrictions on donors are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation may not be accepted at any point in the future, thus constituting a [[de facto]] ban. Restrictions vary from country to country and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. The restrictions affect these men and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. The [[United States Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (FDA) asserts that the one year deferral window is "supported by the best available scientific evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/fda-lifts-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men|title=Gay and Bisexual Men Can Soon Donate Blood – but There's a Catch|website=US News &amp; World Report|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Hepatitis B]], and [[Hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Schoettes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blood Donations Questions|last=Schoettes|first=Scott|date=December 2012|newspaper=Adelante Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |title=Blood for Sale |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Stier|first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, [http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf Chapter 05], June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that "the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood".&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that "new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules". Furthermore, [[NHS Blood and Transplant]] are now investigating how possible it is for MSM, depending on degree of risk, to donate without even the three month deferral.&lt;ref name=bbcjul17&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40669950 |title=Blood donation rules relaxed for gay men and sex workers |accessdate=28 August 2017 |date=23 July 2017 |publisher=BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behavior considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;  While HIV is reliably detected in 10 to 14 days with RNA testing, older testing methods provide accuracy for only up to 98% of positive cases after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html|title = HIV Test Window Periods|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|publisher = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are massive amounts of residual fear about blood product contamination stemming from the contaminated blood scandals, which have caused thousands of deaths due to HIV and Hepatitis C in patients requiring a blood transfusion. Contaminated blood put [[hemophilia|haemophiliacs]] at massive risk and severe mortality, increasing the risk of common surgical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-16|title=Contaminated haemophilia blood products|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products&amp;oldid=805668781|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include [[Isaac Asimov]], who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-22|title=Isaac Asimov|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isaac_Asimov&amp;oldid=811619239|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS==
{{Main article|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many developed countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"/&gt;

In the United States in 2005, MSM, [[African Americans]], and persons engaging in high-risk heterosexual behavior accounted for respectively 49%, 49%, and 32% of new HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/statistics_2005_hiv_surveillance_report_vol_17.pdf HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 in the United States, African Americans accounted for 47.9% of new HIV diagnoses reported that year, but represented approximately only 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/america.htm|title=HIV and AIDS in America|publisher=avert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months however it was rejected by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA). The Red Cross will re-submit their application to reduce the deferral period to six months in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vd8zd3/why-cant-gay-men-donate-blood-in-australia|title=Why Can't Gay Men Donate Blood in Australia?|website=VICE|access-date=28 August 2017|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Italy, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Spain are the only European countries that don't have deferral policies for men who have sex with men. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donarsangre.org/donantes-de-sangre/|title=Donantes de sangre - Centro de Donación de Sangre de Cruz Roja|publisher=[[Cruz Roja Española]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Mundo 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/salud/2015/04/29/5540e08bca47415e108b4579.html|title=España no discrimina a los donantes por su orientación sexual|date=29 April 2015|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3 month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood, the lowest in the western world.

In Ireland, [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) may donate blood if they have not engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at least 12 months prior to a donation. This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tomás Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a "window period" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12 month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|website=RTE.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister - Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tomás Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

However he also criticised the new 12 month deferral policy on MSM and called on Ireland's Health Minister to initiate a review of the IBTS and replace the 12 month deferral period for MSM with no deferral or a 3 month deferral on all donors following sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blood-transfusion-service-finally-lifts-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood-439426.html|title=Blood Transfusion Service finally lifts ban on gay men donating blood|date=17 January 2017|work=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gay-donor-tooth-and-nail-battle-to-give-blood-at-an-end-1.2939185|title=Gay donor: 'Tooth and nail' battle to give blood at an end|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/231273/i-abstained-from-sex-for-23-months-gay-ul-student-wins-fight-over-blood-donations.html|title='I abstained from sex for 23 months': Gay UL student wins fight over blood donations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high risk sexual contact."  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring  infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.

Since 10 July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Since 2009, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) had deferred males who have had oral or anal intercourse, with or without protection, with another male for five years. From the formation of the NZBS in 1998 to 2009, the deferral period had been ten years, but reduced to five years following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007-8 which found no significant difference in risk to the blood supply for deferral periods of five years compared to ten years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |title= Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review - Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service |date= April 2008 |accessdate= 20 July 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121029210122/http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |archive-date= 29 October 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to one year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by recently gained facts about HIV transmission in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral. The new 1 year deferral has been in effect since 15 December 2014.

The one year deferral period for MSM is on par with the one year deferral period for persons engaging in prostitution outside of New Zealand and people who have resided in a country which has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence. Females who engage in sexual intercourse with a male who has had sex with another male are also deferred for twelve months.&lt;ref name="NZBS-safeblood"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/Give-blood/Donating/Detailed-eligibility-criteria |title= Detailed Eligibility Criteria |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, the current guidance from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is to defer any male donor who has had sex with another man (MSM) in the past year. This has been so since December 2015.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/fda-eases-restrictions-blood-donations-gay-men-35888660|title=Health Index|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sexual partners of MSM are deferred for one year since the last exposure. This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. The policy was first put in place in 1983 by the FDA, which regulates blood donations to profit and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors of what the FDA calls "HCT/P's", a category that includes transplants (other than organs) and some reproductive tissue, notably anonymous semen donations, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv FDA/CBER - Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319073505/http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv |date=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UNOS]] policies for [[Organ donation]] require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |title=OPTN/UNOS POLICY 4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619200410/http://unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |archive-date=19 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease.  The one year deferral was approved by the FDA on 21 December 2015, replacing a lifetime ban on donations from MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/12/21/fda-officially-alters-decades-old-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men/|title=FDA: Gay men can once again donate blood in U.S., if they haven't had sex for a year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of calls to change the policy====

* In 2006, the [[AABB]], [[American Red Cross]], and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2010, the [[New York City Council]] passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to eliminate the ban stating "This ban was based on prejudice, a knee-jerk reaction, and misunderstandings about the HIV/AIDS disease. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |title=Legislative and Community Report |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=[[New York City Council]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=2 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y5nQs7v6?url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |archivedate=20 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 1 June 2010, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed a resolution calling on the FDA to "reverse the lifetime deferment of blood donations by men who have had sex with men since 1977 in favor of a policy that protects the safety and integrity of the blood supply that is based on an up-to-date scientific criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |title=A Resolution 18-486 : In the Council of the District of Columbia |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=Dcregs.dc.gov |accessdate=28 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202852/http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2013, the American Medical Association issued a statement calling on the FDA to change the policy, stating that "The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2013/2013-06-18-new-ama-policies-annual-meeting.page |title=AMA Adopts New Policies on Second Day of Voting at Annual Meeting |author=no author listed |work=ama-assn.org |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |date=18 June 2013|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/american-medical-association-opposes-fda-ban-gay-men/story?id=19436366 |title=FDA Ban on Gay Men as Blood Donors Opposed by American Medical Association |publisher=ABC News |last=Mohney|first=Gillian|date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2013, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] approved a policy calling on the FDA to "end the indefinite deferment period for Men who have sex with Men (MSM)", and to "modify the exclusion criteria for MSM to be consistent with deferrals for those judged to be at an increased risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |title=American Osteopathic Association Calls for Removing FDA's Blood Donor Ban |publisher=Osteopathic.org |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821193753/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |archive-date=21 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 14 December 2015, Jordan Moll-Vigrass, Congressmen [[Brian Higgins]] and the [http://www.pridecenterwny.org/ Pride Center of Western New York] held a community rally in [[Buffalo, New York]] to rally against the [[Food and Drug Administration]] policy that bans blood donations by gay and bisexual men. Moll-Vigrass, who is openly gay and had been in a committed relationship for four years, was refused as a blood donor after disclosing his sexual orientation during the questionnaire screening process. Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkbw.com/news/gay-man-fighting-for-right-to-give-blood|title=Gay man fighting for right to give blood|last=Pasceri|first=Joanna|date=December 2015|publisher=[[WKBW-TV|WKBW]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The government’s unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation," said Higgins.  "Eligibility should be based on risk-based science rather than outdated, fear-based speculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Rally Against FDA|url=https://higgins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/blood-is-blood-community-rally-against-the-fda-policy-banning-gay-blood|website=Congressmen Brian Higgins}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*On 21 December 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed the policy by replacing the indefinite deferral with a 1-year deferral.&lt;ref name="Mohney"/&gt; The change was proposed the previous July.&lt;ref name=FDAMay2015&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM446580.pdf |title=Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uippav&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/health/fda-lifting-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.html|title=F.D.A.

*On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/tm/questionnaires/Pages/dhqaabb.aspx|title=Blood Donor History Questionnaires|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM.
*As of December 2016, the [[American Red Cross]] reports that MSM may be eligible to donate blood if they did not have sex with another man in more than 12 months.  The American Red Cross reports that, in January 2017, the organization began donor reinstatement of MSM who were previously deferred from donating, and who later became qualified to donate blood in accordance with the new donation deferral period of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic|title=Eligibility Criteria by Topic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Red Cross website specifies that this 12-month deferral does also apply to [[transgender men]] who have sex with men, but does not apply to [[transgender women]] who have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/lgbtq-donors|title=LGBTQ+ Donors|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning for the restrictions==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM using the statistically higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis of MSM in population studies.

In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, there were no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from groups at high risk of acquiring or having HIV, including MSM. These restrictions are similar to present-day restrictions in most countries on people residing in the United Kingdom during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus. However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus. This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221174758/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html |date=21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because they are highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. In developing countries, these tests are often the only method used to screen donated blood for HIV. To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors. Other groups with similar restrictions include commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, and people resident in countries with a high HIV prevalence (such as sub-Saharan Africa). Newer tests look for the virus itself, such as the [[p24 antigen]] test, which looks for a part on the surface of the virus, and [[Nucleic acid tests]] (NAT), which look for the genetic material of the virus. With these tests, the window period is shorter, with an average duration of 12 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Fourth generation combination HIV tests are conclusive at 3 months, and Hepatitis B tests are conclusive at 6 months.

Risks are also associated with a non-MSM donors testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat haemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on haemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of bloodborne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

==Criticism of the restrictions==
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=Policies on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer (LGBTQ) Issues - AMA|website=www.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. "Ideal" inventories are at least a three-day supply, but many blood centers struggle to meet this demand.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Further advocating for change stems from the fact that the ban is a blanket ban encompassing all men who have had sex with another man, even with protection and even if the HIV status of these men's partners is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, other high-risk activities such as having sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor have a set deferral period before the donor is allowed to donate blood, whereas in some countries MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Female donors who have sexual contact with MSM are sometimes deferred temporarily.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Following [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|a mass shooting targeting a gay nightclub]] in June 2016, there were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barron-Lopez |first=Laura |date=13 June 2016 |title=Democrats Call On FDA To End Ban On Blood Donations From Gay Men |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-blood-donations-gay_us_575ed49ce4b0ced23ca8b4b3 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging the ban to be lifted.

==Activism in favor of reform of MSM donor policies==

===Student and faculty activism on campuses===
'''In Canada'''
* The students association at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/07/10/ottawa-carleton-university-students-ban-blood-clinics-gay-man-policy.html |title=Blood clinic ban on campus upheld due to policy on gay men|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In the United States'''&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;

*In 2005, a student activist at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) filed a complaint with the university's Office of Affirmative Action, contending that American Red Cross blood drives on campus violated UVM's non-discrimination policy.  The office recommended that the university no longer allow the Red Cross to conduct blood drives on campus, but the UVM administration rejected the recommendation, stating that it would not be in the interests of public health. Student and LGBT activism on the issue continued at UVM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Picard|url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/queer-community-seeing-red-over-blood-donation-policy/Content?oid=2128682|title=Queer Community Seeing Red Over Blood-Donation Policy|newspaper=[[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]]|date=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the UVM Student Government Associated voted down, by a 16-15 vote, a nonbinding resolution calling on the university to ban blood drives over the policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/NEWS03/710180365/1004/NEWS03 UVM student government rejects ban on Red Cross blood drives], Associated Press (18 October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">[[File:Nash liquid-ring pump - skid unit.jpg|thumb|[[Liquid-ring pump|Liquid-ring]] compressor system mounted on frame and being moved to its installation position. ]]
A '''modular process skid''' is a [[Process engineering|process system]] contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported.  Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.

Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csidesigns.com/flowgeeks/what-is-a-skid-system/ |title=What Is a Skid System? &amp;#124; FlowGeeks |publisher=Csidesigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/advantages-of-modular-process-design-infographic |title=Advantages of Modular Process Design Infographic |publisher=Epicmodularprocess.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred.

==Skid design and layout==
Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proscon.com/solutions/modular.html |title=Modular Process Systems from |publisher=ProsCon |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All skids have the following characteristics in common:
* '''Portable design'''– because they are self-contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. 
* '''Small footprint''' – process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design
* '''Gathered process connections''' – process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. 
* '''Controlled assembly''' – skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. 
*[[Acceptance testing|'''FAT testing''']] before installation – Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time.
*'''Accessible layout''' – skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

'''Peace education''' is the process of acquiring the ''values'', the ''knowledge'' and developing the ''attitudes, skills, and behaviors'' to live in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the natural environment.

There are numerous [[United Nations]] declarations on the importance of peace education.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Chapter 1. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]; and Page, James S.

[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12720/ Further information]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ban Ki Moon]], U.N. Secretary General, has dedicated the [[International Day of Peace]] 2013 to peace education in an effort to refocus minds and financing on the preeminence of peace education as the means to bring about a [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|culture of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/2013/sgmessage_countdown.shtml Peace Day 2013 Countdown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples include:

* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Section 26.
* Recommendation Concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Section 18.
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], Article 29.1(d).
* [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] – [[World Conference on Human Rights]], Part 2, Paragraphs 78–82, which identify peace education as part of [[human rights education]], and which identifies this education as vital for world peace

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koichiro Matsuura]], the immediate past Director-General of [[UNESCO]], has written of peace education as being of "fundamental importance to the mission of UNESCO and the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;Matsuura, Koichiro. (2008) 'Foreword'. In: J.S.Page ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations.'' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Peace education as a right is something which is now increasingly emphasized by peace researchers such as [[Betty Reardon]]&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Betty.

== Definition ==

Ian Harris and John Synott have described peace education as a series of "teaching encounters" that draw from people:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian and Synott, John. (2002) 'Peace Education for a New Century' ''Social Alternatives'' 21(1):3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*their desire for peace,
*nonviolent alternatives for managing conflict, and
*skills for critical analysis of structural arrangements that produce and legitimize [[social injustice|injustice]] and [[social inequality|inequality]].
[[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] suggests peace education be thought of as "encouraging a commitment to peace as a settled disposition and enhancing the confidence of the individual as an individual agent of peace; as informing the student on the consequences of war and social injustice; as informing the student on the value of peaceful and just social structures and working to uphold or develop such social structures; as encouraging the student to love the world and to imagine a peaceful future; and as caring for the student and encouraging the student to care for others".&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the theory or philosophy of peace education has been assumed and not articulated. [[Johan Galtung]] suggested in 1975 that no theory for peace education existed and that there was clearly an urgent need for [[peace and conflict studies|such theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan (1975) ''Essays in Peace Research, Volume 1''. Copenhagen: Eljers. pp. 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been attempts to establish such a theory. Joachim James Calleja has suggested  that a philosophical basis for peace education might be located in the [[categorical imperative|Kantian notion of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Calleja, Joachim James (1991) 'A Kantian Epistemology of Education and Peace: An Examination of Concepts and Values'. Unpublishd PhD Thesis. Bradford University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] has suggested that a rationale for peace education might be located in virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, conservative [[political ethics]], aesthetic ethics and the ethics of care.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early decades of the 20th century, "peace education" programs around the world have represented a spectrum of focal themes, including [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclearism]], international understanding, environmental responsibility, communication skills, [[nonviolence]], conflict resolution techniques, democracy, human rights awareness, tolerance of diversity, coexistence and [[gender equality]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Groff, L., and Smoker, P. (1996). Creating global-local cultures of peace. Peace and Conflict
Studies Journal, 3, (June); Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal
(Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-
Bass Publishers; Johnson, M.L. (1998). Trends in peace education. ERIC Digest. ED417123; Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. “Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being”. Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2011}} have also addressed spiritual dimensions of inner harmony, or synthesized a number of the foregoing issues into programs on world citizenship. While academic discourse on the subject has increasingly recognized the need for a broader, more holistic approach to peace education, a review of field-based projects reveals that three variations of peace education are most common: conflict resolution training, democracy education, and [[human rights education]]. New approaches are emerging and calling into question some of theoretical foundations of the models just mentioned. The most significant of these new approaches focuses on peace education as a process of worldview transformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Conflict resolution training===
Peace education programs centered on conflict resolution typically focus on the social-behavioural symptoms of conflict, training individuals to resolve inter-personal disputes through techniques of negotiation and (peer) mediation. Learning to manage anger, "fight fair" and improve communication through skills such as listening, turn-taking, identifying needs, and separating facts from emotions, constitute the main elements of these programs. Participants are also encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to brainstorm together on compromises&lt;ref&gt;See Deutsch, M. (1993). Educating for a peaceful world. American Psychologist, 48, 510-517; Hakvoort, I. and Oppenheimer, L. (1993). Children and adolescents' conceptions of peace, war, and strategies to attain peace: A Dutch case study. Journal of Peace Research, 30, 65-77; Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, approaches of this type aim to "alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S. (1999). Adolescents' beliefs about their conflict behaviour. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 208-230). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training ([[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]], [[Verbal Aikido]], [[Non-violent communication|NVC]]) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: "Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy education===
Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence
and war decreases. At the same time, "a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of [[critical thinking]], debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, [[toleration|tolerance]] of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], compromise and [[conscientious objection]]. Their aim is to produce "responsible citizens" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students "assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others":&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; skills that a multi-party democracy are
based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace.

===Human rights education===
Peace education programs centered on raising [[awareness]] of [[human rights]] typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education "faces continual elaboration, a significant theory-practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity".&lt;ref&gt;Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. "Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being". Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In one practitioner's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can increase the potential for conflict"''&lt;ref&gt;Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, D. (2002). Human rights education in diverse, developing nations: A case in point – South Africa. Issues of Democracy, 7 (March). Retrieved January 12, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldview transformation===
Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78.

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes an "Integrative Theory of Peace" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community.

===Critical peace education===
Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj &amp; Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas &amp; Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty &amp; Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2004). "Comment: what is peace education?" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty, R. &amp; Richmond, O. (2007). "Myth or Reality: Opposing Views on the Liberal Peace and Post-War Reconstruction,", Global Society 21: 491-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding, D. (2017). "Border Cosmopolitanism in Critical Peace Education,", Journal of Peace Education 14(2): 155-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2008). Encyclopedia of Peace Education. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2015). 'Pedagogies of Resistance' and critical peace education praxis. Journal of Peace Education 12(2): 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. &amp; Hantzopooulos, M. (Eds) (2016). Introduction: Theory, Research, and Praxis of Peace Education in Peace Education: International Perspectives. New York: Bloomsbury (1-16).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trifonas, P. P. &amp; Wright, B. (2013). "Introduction," in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Yogic peace education===
Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish &amp; Joyce 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Standish, K. &amp; Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; in concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilised to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society.

== Criticism ==
Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education "inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice". "Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2002). "The Nature of Peace Education: Not All Programs Are Created Equal" in G. Salomon and B. Nevo (eds.) Peace education: The concept, principles and practices in the world. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Quoted in Nelson, Linden L. (2000). "Peace Education from a Psychological Perspective: Contributions of the Peace and Education Working Group of the American Psychological Association Div. 48."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon (2002) raises the problem and its consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Imagine that medical practitioners would not distinguish between invasive surgery to remove malignant tumors and surgery to correct one's vision. Imagine also that while surgeries are practiced, no research and no evaluation of their differential effectiveness accompany them. The field would be considered neither very serious nor very trustworthy. Luckily enough, such a
state of affairs does not describe the field of medicine, but it comes pretty close to describing the field of peace education. First, too many profoundly different kinds of activities taking place in an exceedingly wide array of contexts are all lumped under the same category label of "peace education" as if they belong together. Second, for whatever reason, the field's scholarship in the form of theorizing, research and program evaluation badly lags behind practice… In the absence of clarity of what peace education really is, or how its different varieties relate to each other, it is unclear how experience with one variant of peace education in one region can usefully inform programs in another region."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Clarke-Habibi (2005), "A general or integrated theory of peace is needed: one that can holistically account for the intrapersonal, inter-personal, inter-group and international dynamics of peace, as well as its main principles and pre-requisites. An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke-Habibi, Sara. (2005) "Transforming Worldviews: The Case of Education for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Journal of Transformative Education, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 33-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">'''Philosophical counseling''', also sometimes called '''philosophical practice''', is a contemporary movement in [[practical philosophy]].  Developing since the 1980s, practitioners of philosophical counseling ordinarily have a doctorate or minimally a master's degree in philosophy and offer their philosophical counseling or consultation services to clients who look for a philosophical understanding of their lives, social problems, or even mental problems. In the last case philosophical counseling might be in lieu of, or in conjunction with, traditional [[psychotherapy]]. The movement has often been said to be rooted in the [[Socrates|Socratic tradition]], which viewed philosophy as a search for the Good and the good life. A life without [[philosophy]] was not worth living for Socrates.

==History ==
Peter Koestenbaum at San Jose State University in California was an early figure in Philosophical Counseling. His 1978 book ''The New Image of the Person: The Theory and Practice of Clinical Philosophy'' set out the essential contributions of philosophy to counseling. His own practice was augmented by extensive training of mental health professionals in applications of philosophical principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pib.net/bio_peter.htm | accessdate=2014-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the German Society for Philosophical Practice and Counseling, which was founded in 1982 by the German philosopher, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sites.google.com/site/thephilosophicalcounselingweb/home/ |title= The Philosophical Practice and Counseling Website|author= Center Sophon|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA), formerly called the American Society for Philosophy, Counseling, and Psychotherapy, which was co-founded in 1992 by three American philosophers, Elliot D. Cohen, Paul Sharkey, and Thomas Magnell. The NPCA offers a primary certificate in [[logic-based therapy]] (LBT) through the Institute of Critical Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.npcassoc.org/ |title= National Philosophical Counseling Association - Official Website | accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) was founded in 1998 in New York City by Professor Lou Marinoff.  APPA offers a certification program in client counseling for those with advanced degrees in philosophy who wish to practice philosophical counseling.  It also publishes a professional Journal and has a membership list of those certified as philosophical counselors on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.appa.edu/ |title= American Philosophical Practitioners Association - Official Website | accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinoff was at the center of a 2004 controversy when his philosophical counseling practice at [[City College of New York]] was temporarily shuttered by college officials who feared he was offering mental health advice without proper training and licensing; Marinoff responded by suing for what he described as his [[freedom of speech]] being stifled.&lt;ref name=Duane2004/&gt;

There are presently a number of professional associations for philosophical counseling throughout the world, including France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Finland, Luxembourg, Israel, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Portugal, Korea, Turkey, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States.

==Goals and methods==
According to the Preamble of the NPCA Standards of Practice,
:a philosophical practitioner helps clients to clarify, articulate, explore and comprehend philosophical aspects of their belief systems or world views....Clients may consult philosophical practitioners for help in exploring philosophical problems related to such matters as mid-life crises, career changes, stress, emotions, assertiveness, physical illness, death and dying, aging, meaning of life, and morality. On the other side philosophical practitioners also initiate projects in common life worlds with various goals that are related to essential problems of life, such as sustainable energy, direct democracy, etc. 
Activities common to philosophical practice include:
# the examination of clients' arguments and justifications
# the clarification, analysis, and definition of important terms and concepts
# the exposure and examination of underlying assumptions and logical implications
# the exposure of conflicts and inconsistencies
# the exploration of traditional philosophical theories and their significance for client issues
# the initiation of projects for common goods 
# all other related activities that have historically been identified as philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/documents/ |title= Standards of Practice|author= ASPCP|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods and orientations of philosophical counselors vary greatly. Some practitioners, such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (Germany), [[Michel Weber]] (Belgium) and [[Shlomit C. Schuster]] (Israel) are dialogical and dialective engaged, while confessing to a "beyond method" approach. They hold that philosophical counseling has the aim to empower clients' philosophical abilities, which additionally may have therapeutic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, S.C. (1999). [http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?id=2147498636 ''Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy''.] Westport, CT:[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]; cf. [[Michel Weber]]'s own blend of [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber praxis].&lt;/ref&gt;  "Others are directive oriented and view philosophical counseling as a form of mental health intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, P. (2001). ''Philosophical Counseling.'' Westport, CT: [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical practitioners, notably Louis Marinoff (U.S.) and Guenther Witzany (Austria), view philosophical practice as a separate practice area distinct from mental health practices such as psychology and mental health counseling;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther Witzany (ed) (1991). Zur Theorie der Philosophischen Praxis. Essen. {{ISBN|3-89206-407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others, notably Elliot D. Cohen (U.S.), think they are necessarily intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/journal/table-of-contents/vol-2-no-2/ |title= Philosophy with Teeth:  The Wedding of Philosophical and Psychological Practices|author= Elliot D. Cohen|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical counselors draw inspiration from the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, arguing that widespread mental health diagnostic criteria as outlined in [[DSM IV]] have unfairly or inaccurately [[psychopathology|pathologized]] humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Z. Kotkowicz (1997). ''R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry'', NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''New York Times'' article on philosophical counseling, "only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's [[logic-based therapy]] builds on the work of his mentor [[Albert Ellis]], who invented [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]."&lt;ref name=Duane2004&gt;{{cite news |last=Duane |first=Daniel |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/magazine/the-socratic-shrink.html?src=pm |title= The Socratic Shrink |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1420">The '''pluriblast''' is a [[Pluripotency|pluripotent]] population of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[embryogenesis]] of [[marsupial]]s, called the [[inner cell mass]] in [[eutherian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheng | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Epiblast morphogenesis before gastrulation | url = | journal = Dev. Biol. | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.10.003i }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pluriblast is distinct from the [[trophoblast]], and gives rise to the [[germ layer]]s of the [[embryo]], as well as extra embryonic [[endoderm]] and extra embryonic [[mesoderm]].  Both the pluriblast and trophoblast arise from the [[Totipotency|totipotent]] cells of the early [[conceptus]].  By definition, the pluriblast does not give rise to trophoblast cells during normal development, although it may retain this potential under experimental conditions.

In [[metatherian]]s ([[marsupial]])s the pluriblast forms part of the blastocyst wall and no structure exists that can be described as an inner cell mass.  "Inner cell mass" is thus a morphological term peculiar to eutherian mammals, whereas "pluriblast" is a functional term more widely applicable to conserved aspects of mammalian development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]].

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

* Viewing child pornography increases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse.  Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user&lt;!-- citation needed. --&gt;.
* Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses. [[Simulated child pornography]] is suggested as an alternative so that real children are not harmed&lt;!-- citation needed. --&gt;.  
* There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all.

==Views on increasing criminal sexual intent==

===General===
One perspective is that exposure to [[child pornography]] promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses,&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt; but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms. The authors also note that, "among some groups of predisposed individuals, easy access to a wide variety of engrossing and high-quality child pornography could serve as a substitute for involvement with actual victims".&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt;

According to the National District Attorneys Association of America, "In light of the documented link between individuals who view child pornography and individuals who actually molest children, each child pornography case should be viewed as a red flag to the possibility of actual child molestation."&lt;ref name=NDAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |title=From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children |accessdate=2008-05-03 |work=Child Sexual Exploitation Update - Volume 1, Number 3, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111204617/http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Carr, founding member of the United Kingdom Home Secretary’s Internet Task Force on Child Protection, in a report published by the [[Action for Children|NCH]] stated, "Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children."&lt;ref name="Carr 2004"/&gt;

===Research===
A 1987 report by the U.S.A. [[National Institute of Justice]] described "a disturbing correlation" between traders of child pornography and acts of [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]].&lt;ref name=NCJRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Arnold I Burns Before the Florida Law Enforcement Committee on Obscenity, Organized Crime and Child Pornography |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=109133 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |work=NCJ 109133 |date=1987-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 [[longitudinal study]] of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased [[recidivism]] risk for all groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kingston DA, etal |title=Pornography use and sexual aggression: the impact of frequency and type of pornography use on recidivism among sexual offenders.|journal= Aggress Behav|year=2008|issue=34|pmid=18307171|pages=1–11|doi=10.1002/ab.20250|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on [[phallometric testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., Cantor, J. M., &amp; Blanchard, R. (2006). Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115,'' U.S.A. 610–615.&lt;/ref&gt; A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., &amp; Eke, A. W. (2005). The criminal histories and later offending of child pornography offenders. ''Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17,'' 201–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mayo Clinic]] of the U.S.A., studies and case reports indicate that 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child; however, they state that it is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized child pornography to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic04_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues |author=RYAN C. W. HALL; RICHARD C. W. HALL |journal=Mayo Clin Proc |date=April 2007 |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=457–471 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |doi=10.4065/82.4.457 |pmid=17418075 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040559/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by psychologists at the American [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] has concluded that "many Internet child pornography offenders may be undetected child molesters", finding a slightly higher percentage of molesters among child pornography offenders than the Mayo Clinic study, though they also "cautioned that offenders who volunteer for treatment may differ in their behavior from those who do not seek treatment." The study was withdrawn by Bureau officials from a peer-reviewed journal which had accepted it for publication, due to concerns that the results might be misinterpreted. Some researchers argued that the findings "do not necessarily apply to the large and diverse group of adults who have at some point downloaded child pornography, and whose behavior is far too variable to be captured by a single survey".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/us/19sex.html |title=Debate on Child Pornography's Link To Molesting |publisher=New York Times |author=Julian Sher and Benedict Carey| date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child protection advocates and psychologists like [[Fred Berlin]], who heads the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma, expressed disapproval over the failure to publish the report.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Dennis Howitt]] (1995) disagrees with such research, arguing the weakness of correlational studies. He argues that "one cannot simply take evidence that offenders use and buy pornography as sufficient to implicate pornography causally in their offending. The most reasonable assessment based on the available research literature is that the relationship between pornography, fantasy and offending is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;Howitt, Dennis (1995). "Paedophiles and Sexual Offences against Children," chapter 6. Loughborough University, UK; John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swiss study reviewing the criminal record of 231 men who were charged with viewing child pornography found that those without a prior sexual conviction are unlikely to sexually assault a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Endrass |first=Jérôme |last2=Urbaniok |first2=Frank |date=14 July 2009 |title=The consumption of Internet child pornography and violent and sex offending |url=http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |journal=BMC Psychiatry |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=43 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swiss_study&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-finds-no-link-between-child-porn-and-sex-abuse/story-fn3dxity-1225749645592 |title=Study finds no link between child porn and sex abuse |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that in the six years before the 2002 police operation, 1% were known to have committed a hands-on sexual offense and 1% committed a hands-on sex offense in the six years afterwards. The study reinforces previous research that consumers are well-educated and view other types of illegal pornography like acts involving animals and violence as well. Author Frank Urbaniok said it should not automatically be assumed that they were a risk for sexually assaulting a child and said: "Our results support the assumption that these consumers, in fact, form a distinct group of sex offenders. Probably, the motivation for consuming child pornography differs from the motivation to physically assault minors. Furthermore, the recidivism rates of 1% for hands-on and 4% for hands-off sex offences were quite low."&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt; A 2005 paper by Canadian researchers [[Michael Seto]] and Angela Eke found that of 201 men charged with child pornography offenses, 24% had committed prior offenses of sexual contact and 4% went on to commit subsequent sexual offenses after being charged or prosecuted.&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt;

==Views on reducing criminal sexual intent==
Milton Diamond, from the [[University of Hawaii]], presented evidence that "[l]egalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse". Results from the Czech Republic indicated, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes "decreased or essentially remained stable" following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. His research also indicated that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen considerably since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible – a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan. The findings support the theory that potential sexual offenders use child pornography as a substitute for sex crimes against children. While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

Diamond suggests to provide [[Simulated child pornography|artificially created child pornography]] that does not involve any real children. His article relayed, "If availability of pornography can reduce sex crimes, it is because the use of certain forms of pornography to certain potential offenders is functionally equivalent to the commission of certain types of sex offences: both satisfy the need for psychosexual stimulants leading to sexual enjoyment and orgasm through masturbation. If these potential offenders have the option, they prefer to use pornography because it is more convenient, unharmful and undangerous. (Kutchinsky, 1994, pp. 21)."&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = M. | last2 = Jozifkova | first2 = E. | last3 = Weiss | first3 = P. | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9696-y | title = Pornography and Sex Crimes in the Czech Republic | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1043; discussion 1043–50 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21116701| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of race and ethnic relations''' is the study of [[social]], [[political]], and [[economic]] relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of [[society]]. This area encompasses the study of systemic [[racism]], like [[residential segregation]] and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. The sociological analysis of race and ethnicity frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as, but not limited to, [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]].

At the level of political policy, ethnic relations is discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]]. [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  At the level of academic inquiry, ethnic relations is discussed either by the experiences of individual racial-ethnic groups or else by overarching theoretical issues.

==Classical Theorists==

===Marx===

[[Marx]] described society as having nine "great" classes, the capitalist class and the working class, with the middle classes falling in behind one or the other as they see fit. He hoped for the working class to rise up against the capitalist class in an attempt to stop the exploitation of the working class. He blamed part of their failure to organize on the capitalist class, as they separated black and white laborers. This separation, specifically between Blacks and Whites in America,  contributed to racism. Marx attributes [[capitalism]]'s contribution to racism through segmented labor markets and a racial inequality of earnings.&lt;ref name="Bohmer"&gt;Bohmer, Peter. 1998. [http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/marxracism.html    Marxist Theory of Racism and Racial Inequality].  Readings in Black Political Economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weber===
[[Weber]] laid the foundations for a micro-sociology of ethnic relations beginning in 1906.  Weber argued that biological traits could not be the basis for group foundation unless they were conceived as shared characteristics. It was this shared perception and common customs that create and distinguish one ethnicity from another.  This differs from the views of many of his contemporaries who believed that an ethnic group was formed from biological similarities alone apart from social perception of membership in a group.&lt;ref name="Banton"&gt;Banton, Michael. 2008. The Sociology of Ethnic Relations. ''Ethnic and Racial Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===W.E.B. Du Bois===
[[W.E.B. Du Bois]] is well known as one of the most influential black scholars and activists of the 20th century. Du Bois educated himself on his people, and sought academia as a way to enlighten others on the social injustices against his people. Du Bois research "revealed the [[Negro]] group as a symptom, not a cause; as a striving, palpitating group, and not an inert, sick body of crime; as a long historic development and not a transient occurrence".&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;Du Bois, W.E.B. 1940. Dusk of dawn; an essay toward an autobiography of a race concept. Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois believed that Black Americans should embrace higher education and use their new access to schooling to achieve a higher position within society. He referred to this idea as the [[Talented Tenth]]. With gaining popularity, he also preached the belief that for blacks to be free in some places, they must be free everywhere. After traveling to Africa and Russia, he recanted his original philosophy of integration and acknowledged it as a long term vision.&lt;ref name="Hynes"&gt;Hynes, Gerald. ????. [http://www.duboislc.org/html/DuBoisBio.html  A Biographical Sketch of W.E.B. Du Bois].  W.E.B. Du Bois Learning Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booker T. Washington===

[[Booker T. Washington]] was considered one of the most influential black educators of the 19th and 20th centuries. Born in 1856 as a slave in Virginia, Washington came of age as slavery was coming to an end.  Just as slavery ended, however, it was replaced by a system of sharecropping in the South that resulted in black indebtedness.  With growing discrimination in the South following the end of the Reconstruction era, Washington felt that the key to advancing in America rested with getting an education and improving one's economic well-being, not with political advancement.  Consequently, in 1881, he founded the [[Tuskegee Institute]], now Tuskegee University, in order to provide individuals with an education that would help them to find employment in the growing industrial sector. By focusing on education for blacks, rather than political advancement, he gained financial support from whites for his cause.  Secretly, however, he pursued legal challenges against segregation and disfranchisement of blacks.&lt;ref name="Harlen"&gt;Harlen, Louis. 1972. [http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/washington/bio.html   Booker T. Washington]. University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Theorists ==

=== Patricia Hill Collins ===
[[Patricia Hill Collins]] is currently a Distinguished University Professor Emerita at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. She received her PhD in sociology in 1984 from [[Brandeis University]]. Collins was the president-elect for the [[American Sociological Association]], where she was the 100th president and the first African-American woman to be president of the organization. Collins is a social theorist whose work and research primarily focuses on race, social class, sexuality, and gender. She has written a number of books and articles on said topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Collins/Patricia%20Hill|title=Patricia Hill Collins {{!}} SOCY l Sociology Department l University of Maryland|website=socy.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins work focuses on [[Intersectionality]], by looking at issues through the lens of women of color. In her work, she writes "First, we need new visions of what oppression is, new categories of analysis that are inclusive of race, class, and gender as distinctive yet interlocking structures of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|date=1993|title=Toward a New Vision: Race, Class, and Gender as Categories of Analysis and Connection|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41680038|journal=Race, Sex &amp; Class|volume=1|issue=1|pages=25–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eduardo Bonilla-Silva ===
[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] is currently a professor of sociology at [[Duke University]] and is the 2018 president of the American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/leadership|title=Leadership|date=2009-05-23|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD in 1993 from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], which is where he met his mentor, Professor [[Charles Camic]], of which he said "Camic believed in me and told me, just before graduation, that I should stay in the states as I would contribute greatly to American sociology." Bonilla-Silva did not start off his work as a "race scholar," but originally was trained in [[class analysis]], [[political sociology]], and sociology of development ([[globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.duke.edu/people/eduardo-bonilla-silva|title=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva {{!}} Duke Sociology|website=sociology.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s when he joined a student movement calling for racial justice at the University of Wisconsin that he began his work in race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/footnotes/sep-oct-2017/features/introducing-eduardo-bonilla-silva-2018-asa-president|title=Introducing Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, 2018 ASA President|date=2017-10-29|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, [[Racism without Racists]], Bonilla-Silva discusses less overt racism, which he refers to as "new racism," which disguises itself "under the cloak of legality" in order to accomplish the same things. He also discusses "color-blind racism," which is essentially when people go off the basis that we have achieved equality and deny past and present discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973481548|title=Racism without racists : color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America|last=1962-|first=Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo,|isbn=9781442276222|edition= Fifth|location=Lanham|oclc=973481548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==
[[File:Racistcampaignposter1.jpg|thumb|A racist political campaign poster from the 1866 [[Pennsylvania]] [[governor|gubernatorial]] election]]

One of the most important social psychological findings concerning race relations is that members of stereotyped groups internalize those stereotypes and thus suffer a wide range of harmful consequences.  For example, in a phenomenon called [[stereotype threat]], members of racial and ethnic groups that are stereotyped as scoring poorly on tests will perform poorer on those tests if they are reminded of this stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;"What is stereotype threat?" http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is so strong that even simply asking the test-taker to state her or his race before taking the test (such is by bubbling in "African American" on a multiple choice question) will significantly alter test performance.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Aronson. 1995. Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specifically sociological contribution to this line of research has found that such negative stereotypes can be created on the spot: an experiment by Michael Lovaglia et al.(1998) demonstrated that [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people can be made to suffer stereotype threat if they are led to believe that they are a disadvantaged group for a particular kind of test.&lt;ref name="Lovaglia"&gt;Lovaglia, Michael, JW Lucas, SR Thye. 1998. Status Processes and Mental Ability Test Scores. American Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism and psychoanalysis==

[[Psychoanalysis]] has much to offer the study of racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Pauline, politics and psychoanalysis: theorising racism in Australia|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/39156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central proposition is that rationality is not the natural state of the individual, and that individuals develop defence mechanisms to cope with anxiety. Humans resist change because change threatens established ways of dealing with anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frosch|first1=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis and Psychology: Minding the Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual defence mechanisms contribute to [[social defence]] mechanisms. The most regressive defence mechanism (the 'paranoid-schizoid' position) results in a complete dehumanising of the 'all-bad' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segal|first1=Hanna|title=Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'all-bad' group is admired as well as feared (often evident in the [[conspiracy theory]]). Paradoxically, the arbitrariness of the category 'race' enables the psychotic subject to invest more meaning in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rustin|first1=Michael|title=The Good Society and the Inner World: Psychoanalysis and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernity's attempt at rationalisation papers over a polycentric psyche (i.e. all of us still have anxieties and desires, despite our apparent rationality). Racism is a response to the abstracting logic of modernity. The rationality of western, 'white' society is defined in opposition to the 'animality' of black, 'primitive' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovel, Joel|editor1-last=Elliot|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Frosch|editor2-first=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis in Contexts: Paths between Theory and Modern Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychoanalytic theorists also argue that passionate anti-racism can produce psychological states analogous to racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"/&gt;

==Audit studies==
{{Main|audit study}}
Another important line of research on race takes the form of [[audit studies]].  The audit study approach creates an artificial pool of people among whom there are no average differences by race. For instance, groups of white and black auditors are matched on every category other than their race, and thoroughly trained to act in identical ways.  Given nearly identical resumes, they are sent to interview for the same jobs.  Simple comparisons of means can yield strong evidence regarding discrimination. The best known audit study in sociology is ''The Mark of a Criminal Record'' by [[Harvard University]] sociologist Devah Pager.  This study compares job prospects of black and white men who were recently released from jail.  Its key finding is that blacks are significantly discriminated against when applying for service jobs.  Moreover, whites ''with'' a criminal record have about the same prospect of getting an interview as blacks ''without'' one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pager|first1=D.|title=The Mark of a Criminal Record|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|date=March 2003|volume=108|issue=5|pages=937–975|doi=10.1086/374403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another recent audit by [[UCLA]] sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high quality state higher education institutions.  This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=S. M.|title=Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market|journal=[[Social Forces]]|date=June 2015|volume=93|issue=4|pages=1451–1479|doi=10.1093/sf/sou111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline development by country==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the study of racial and ethnic relations has been widely influenced by the factors associated with each major wave of [[immigration]] as the incoming group struggles with keeping its own cultural and ethnic identity while also assimilating into the broader mainstream [[American culture]] and [[Economy of the United States|economy]].  One of the first and most prevalent topics within American study is that of the relations between white Americans and [[African Americans]] due to the heavy [[collective memory]] and culture borne out of and lingering from centuries of forced [[slavery]] in [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].   Throughout the rest of American history, each new wave of [[immigration to the United States]] has brought another set of issues as the tension between maintaining [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] takes on new shapes.  [[Racism]] and conflict often rears up during these times.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;Park, Robert Ezra. 1950. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcVlv2HTj8C&amp;pg=PR5 The Early Sociology of Race and Ethnicity]. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some key currents can be gleaned from this body of knowledge: in the context of the United States, there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns or retractability of American identities have erupted to the fore of America's political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=American Social ‘Reminders’ of Citizenship after September 11, 2001: Nativisms in the Ethnocratic Retractability of American Identity|journal=Qualitative Sociology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable and infamous examples can be seen in [[Executive Order 9066]] that [[Internment of Japanese Americans|placed Japanese Americans in incarceration centers]] as well as the 19th century [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that banned Chinese laborers from emigrating to the United States (local workers viewed Chinese laborers as a threat). Current examples include post-[[9/11]] backlash against Muslim Americans, although these have taken place in civil society, not through public policy.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], foreign nationals were actively encouraged and sponsored to migrate in the 1950s after the dissolution of [[British Empire|the Empire]] and the social devastation of the [[Second World War]]. The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] changed the law so that only certain [[British Commonwealth]] members were able to migrate. This law was tightened again with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] and [[Immigration Act 1971]]. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] extended certain anti-discrimination policies with respect to employment, housing, commercial and other services. This was extended again with the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].

As with the UK establishments of [[media studies|media]] and [[cultural studies]], 'ethnic relations' is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline either within sociology departments or other schools of humanities.

Major British theorists include [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], Richard Jenkins, [[John Rex]], [[Michael Banton]] and [[Tariq Modood]].

'''Spinmechatronics''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|ɪ|n|əm|ɛ|k|ə|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|n|ɪ|k|s}} is [[neologism]] referring to an emerging field of research concerned with the exploitation of [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent phenomena and established [[spintronic]] methodologies and technologies in conjunction with electro-mechanical, magno-mechanical, acousto-mechanical and opto-mechanical systems. Most especially, spinmechatronics (or spin mechatronics) concerns the integration of [[micro-]] and [[nano-]] [[mechatronic]] systems with [[spin (physics)|spin]] physics and [[spintronics]].

==History and origins==
While spinmechatronics has been recognised only recently &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spinmechatronics.org&lt;/ref&gt; (2008) as an independent field, hybrid [[spin (physics)|spin]]-mechanical system development dates back to the early nineteen-nineties,&lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"&gt;J A Sidles, Noninductive detection of single-proton magnetic resonance. Appl. Phys. Lett., 58(24):2854 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; with devices combining [[spintronics]] and [[micromechanics]] emerging at the turn of the twenty-first century.

One of the longest established spinmechatronic systems is the [[Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope]] or MRFM. First proposed by J. A. Sidles in a seminal paper of 1991 &lt;ref name="A Sidles 1991"/&gt; – and since extensively developed both theoretically and experimentally by a number of international research groups&lt;ref&gt;D Rugar et al., Single spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy. Nature, 430, 329 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G de Loubens et al., Magnetic resonance studies of the fundamental spin-wave modes in individual submicron Cu/NiFe/Cu perpendicularly magnetized disks. Phys. Rev. Lett., 98 (12), 127601 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[MRFM]] operates by coupling a magnetically loaded [[micro-]]mechanical cantilever to an excited nuclear, [[proton]] or [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] system. The [[MRFM]] concept effectively combines scanning atomic force microscopy ([[Atomic force microscope|AFM]]) with [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] to provide a spectroscopic tool of unparalleled sensitivity. [[Nanometre]] resolution is possible, and the technique potentially forms the basis for ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-high resolution magnetic, biochemical, biomedical, and clinical diagnostics.

The synergy of micromechanics and established [[Spintronics|spintronic]] technologies for sensing applications is one of the most significant spinmechatronic developments of the last decade. At the beginning of this century, [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] sensors incorporating [[Magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive]] technologies emerged &lt;ref&gt;M Löhndorf et al., Highly sensitive strain sensors based on magnetic tunnelling junctions. Appl. Phys. Lett.,  81 (2), 313 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and a wide range of devices exploiting similar principles are likely to realize research and commercial potential by 2015.

Contemporary innovation in spinmechatronics drives forward the independent advancement of cutting-edge science in [[spin (physics)|spin physics]], [[spintronics]] and [[micro-]] and [[nano-]][[mechatronics]] and catalyses the development of wholly new instrumentation, [[Control engineering|control]] and fabrication techniques to facilitate and exploit their integration.

==Key constitutive technologies==

===Micro- and nano- mechatronics===
[[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]: [[micro-]][[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems are the key ingredient of [[micro-]][[mechatronics]]. Micro-electromechanical systems are – as the name suggests – devices with significant dimensions in the micrometre regime or less.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memsnet.org/mems/what-is.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jwnc.gla.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Highly suited to integration with electronic and microwave circuitry, they provide the key to electro-mechanical functionalities unachievable with [[Classical physics|classical]] precision [[mechatronics]]. Commercialisation of mass-produced [[Microelectromechanical systems]] products is rapidly picking up pace and includes printer ink-jet technology, 3D [[accelerometer]]s, integrated pressure sensors, and [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) displays. At the cutting edge of [[Microelectromechanical systems]] fabrication and integration technologies are [[nano-]] [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] systems&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/293&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]]). Typical examples are micrometres long, tens of [[nanometre]]s thick, and have mechanical resonance frequencies approaching 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. Their small physical dimensions and mass (of order [[pico-]][[gram]]s) makes them highly sensitive to changes in [[stiffness]]; this, their synergy with mechanical and data processing systems, and the option of attaching chemical/ biological molecules, makes them ideal for ultra high-performance mechanical, chemical and biological sensing applications.

===Spin physics===
Spin physics is a broad and active area of [[condensed-matter physics]] research. ‘[[Spin (physics)|Spin]]’ in this context refers to a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] property of certain [[elementary particle]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and should not be confused with the [[Classical mechanics|classical]] (and better-known) concept of [[rotation]]. Spin physics spans studies of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]], [[electron]] and [[proton]] [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], [[magnetism]], and certain areas of optics. [[Spintronics]] is a branch of spin physics. Perhaps the two best known applications of spin physics are Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) and the spintronic giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head.

===Spintronics===
Spintronic [[magnetoresistance]] is a major scientific and commercial success story. Today, most families own a spintronic device: the giant-magnetoresistive ([[GMR (physics)|GMR]]) [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] read head in their computer. The science that gave rise to this phenomenal business opportunity – and earned the 2007 [[Nobel Prize]] for Physics – was the recognition that electrical carriers are characterized by both [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref&gt;M N Baibich et al., Giant magnetoresistance of (001)Fe/(001)Cr magnetic superlattices. Phys. Rev. Lett., 61, 2472 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/phyadv07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|tunnelling-magnetoresistance]] (TMR) – which uses the electron spin as a label to allow or forbid [[electron]] [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]]&lt;ref&gt;J S Moodera et al., Large magnetoresistance at room temperature in ferromagnetic thin film tunnel junctions. Phys. Rev. Lett., 74 (16), 3273 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; – dominates the hard disk market and is rapidly establishing itself in areas as diverse as magnetic logic devices and biosensors.&lt;ref&gt;J Schotter et al., A Biochip based on magnetoresistive sensors. IEEE Trans. Magn., 38, 5, 3365 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing development is pushing the frontiers of TMR devices towards the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">'''Spring line settlements''' occur where a ridge of [[wiktionary:permeable|permeable]] rock lies over impermeable rock and there will be a line of [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] along the boundary between the two layers.

It sometimes happens that a sequence of spring line (or springline) settlements will arise around these springs, becoming villages.

In each case to build higher up the hill would have meant difficulties with water supply; to build lower would have taken the settlement further away from useful grazing land or nearer to the [[floodplain]].

Spring line villages are often the principal settlements in [[strip parish]]es, with long, narrow [[parish]] boundaries stretching up to the top of the ridge and down to the river but being narrow in the direction of adjacent spring line villages.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples in England==

The term '''stained glass''' can refer to coloured [[glass]] as a material or to works created from it. Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches and other significant religious buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and [[sculpture]]. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term "stained glass" to include domestic [[leadlight]] and [[objets d'art]] created from [[came glasswork]] exemplified in the famous lamps of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].

As a material ''stained glass'' is glass that has been coloured by adding [[Salt (chemistry)|metallic salts]] during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into ''stained glass windows'' in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. [[Paint]]ed details and yellow [[stain]] are often used to enhance the design. The term ''stained glass'' is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.

Stained glass, as an [[art]] and a [[craft]], requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In [[Western Europe]] they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as "illuminated wall decorations".

The design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the [[Bible]], history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church – episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]]; within a parliament building – shields of the constituencies; within a college hall – figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home – flora, fauna, or landscape.

Stained glass is still popular today, but often referred to as art glass.  It is prevalent in luxury homes, commercial buildings, and places of worship.  Artists and companies are contracted to create beautiful art glass ranging from domes, windows, backsplashes, etc.

==Glass production==
{{Main|Architectural glass}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

During the late [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as [[potash]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], and [[lead]] can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to [[flashed glass]].

===Cylinder glass or Muff===
Using a blow-pipe, a "gather" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an [[Annealing (glass)|annealer]] to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. "Hand-blown" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows. Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapeles as well as many more well respected buildings.

===Crown glass===
This hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a [[potter's wheel]]. The [[centrifugal force]] causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the "bull's-eye", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the "pontil" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.

===Rolled glass===
[[Architectural glass#Rolled plate (figured) glass|Rolled glass]] (sometimes called "table glass") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or [[graphite]] table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called [[cathedral glass]], but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.

===Flashed glass===
Architectural glass must be at least {{sfrac|1|8}} of an inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of {{sfrac|1|8}} inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming "[[flashed glass]]".

A lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, [[hydrofluoric acid]] was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.

===Modern production of traditional glass===
There are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular [[Tiffany glass]] and [[Dalle de verre]].

==Colours==

===Transparent glass===

Ordinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include [[manganese dioxide]] which produces [[sodium permanganate]], and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in [[New England]]. [[Selenium]] has been used for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Glass Dictionary"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100205233650/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html Illustrated Glass Dictionary] www.glassonline.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green glass===

While very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of [[Iron(II) oxide]] which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with [[chromium]] it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make [[wine bottle]]s.
The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet – Chromium] www.speclab.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Together with tin oxide{{clarify |date=April 2017 |reason=There are multiple Tin Oxides}} and arsenic it yields [[emerald (color)|emerald green]] glass.

===Blue glass===

*In medieval times, blue glass was made by adding cobalt, which at a concentration of 0.025% to 0.1% in soda-lime glass achieves the brilliant blue characteristic of [[Chartres Cathedral]].
*The addition of [[sulphur]] to boron-rich [[borosilicate glass]]es imparts a blue colour.
* The addition of [[copper oxide]] at 2–3% produces a [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] colour.
* The addition of [[nickel]], at different concentrations, produces blue, violet, or black glass.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5abGjJ54mSoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=The+addition+of+nickel,+at+different+concentrations,+produces+blue,+violet,+or+black+glass.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn2tvlqpzYAhVCz2MKHfuZCp8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20addition%20of%20nickel,%20at%20different%20concentrations,%20produces%20blue,%20violet,%20or%20black%20glass.&amp;f=false|title=The Illustrated Bead Bible: Terms, Tips &amp; Techniques|last=Geary|first=Theresa Flores|date=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=|isbn=9781402723537|location=|pages=108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red glass===

* Metallic [[gold]], in very low concentrations (around 0.001%), produces a rich ruby-coloured glass ("ruby gold"); in even lower concentrations it produces a less intense red, often marketed as "[[cranberry glass]]". The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.
* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally "flashed" (laminated glass). It was used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploited for the decorative effects that could be achieved by sanding and engraving.
*[[Selenium]] is an important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulphide, it yields a brilliant red colour known as "Selenium Ruby".&lt;ref name="Illustrated Glass Dictionary"/&gt;

===Yellow glass===

* [[Silver]] compounds (notably [[silver nitrate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFQ4AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;dq=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFxZSXudnUAhVX-GMKHdtwDeMQ6AEIJDAA|title=Ceramic Industry|last=Steinhoff|first=Frederick Louis|date=1973|publisher=Industrial Publications, Incorporated|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used as stain applied to the surface of glass and fired on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2fQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;dq=Silver+compounds+(notably+silver+nitrate)+are+used+as+stain+applied+to+the+surface+of+glass+and+fired+on&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFxZSXudnUAhVX-GMKHdtwDeMQ6AEIKTAB|title=Chambers's encyclopaedia|date=1967|publisher=Pergamon Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can produce a range of colours from [[Orange (colour)|orange]]-red to yellow. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colours produced by these compounds. The chemistry involved is complex and not well understood.
* The addition of sulphur, together with [[carbon]] and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulphides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. With [[calcium]] it yields a deep yellow colour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305020112/http://1st.glassman.com/articles/glasscolouring.html Substances Used in the Making of Coloured Glass] 1st.glassman.com (David M Issitt). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adding [[titanium]] produces [[yellow]]ish-[[brown]] glass. Titanium is rarely used on its own and is more often employed to intensify and brighten other additives.
* [[Cadmium]] together with sulphur results in deep yellow colour, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic.
* [[Uranium]] (0.1% to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or green colour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110418061335/http://www.glassassociation.org.uk/Journal/uranium.htm Uranium Glass] www.glassassociation.org.uk (Barrie Skelcher). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranium glass]] is typically not [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be [[carcinogenic]]. When used with lead glass with a very high proportion of lead, it produces a deep red colour.

===Purple glass===

* The addition of [[manganese]] gives an [[Amethyst (color)|amethyst]] colour. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass has been used since early Egyptian history.
* [[Nickel]], depending on the concentration, produces blue, or [[violet (colour)|violet]], or even [[black]] glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Lead crystal]] with added nickel acquires a purplish colour.

===White glass===

* [[Tin dioxide]] with [[antimony trioxide|antimony]] and [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] oxides produce an opaque [[white]] glass, first used in [[Venice]] to produce an imitation [[porcelain]]. White glass was used extensively by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] to create a range of [[Tiffany glass|opalescent, mottled and streaky glasses]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Creating stained glass windows==

===Design===
The first stage in the production of a window is to make, or acquire from the architect or owners of the building, an accurate template of the window opening that the glass is to fit.

The subject matter of the window is determined to suit the location, a particular theme, or the wishes of the patron. A small design called a ''Vidimus'' (from Latin "we have seen") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model [[maquette]] may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.

A traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.

A full-sized cartoon is drawn for every "light" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple [[tracery]] lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large [[cathedral]] might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.

===Selecting and painting the glass===

Each piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by "grozing" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.Details of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.

From 1300 onwards, artists started using "silver stain" which was made with [[silver nitrate]]. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass. By about 1450, a stain known as "Cousin's rose" was used to enhance flesh tones.

In the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.

A method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead [[came]]. This allows for the use of techniques such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]] to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.

===Assembly and mounting===

Once the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see [[Came glasswork]].

Traditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ''ferramenta''. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.

==History==

===Origins===
Stained glass has been produced since ancient times. Both the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects. [[Phoenicia]] was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Antioch]]. The [[British Museum]] holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the [[Lycurgus Cup]], which is a murky mustard color but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the [[Portland vase]] which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.

In early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced alabaster set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.

Evidence of stained glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when [[Benedict Biscop]] imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at [[Monkwearmouth]]. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at [[Jarrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Discovering stained glass – John Harries, Carola Hicks, Edition: 3 – 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at [[Raqqa]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.

===In Southwest Asia===
The creation of stained glass in [[Southwest Asia]] began in ancient times. One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the [[Assyria|Assyrian]] city of [[Nineveh]], dating to the seventh century BC. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'', attributed to the 8th century [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|alchemist]] [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt. The ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%209.htm The Manufacture of Coloured Glass] and [http://www.history-science-technology.com/articles/articles%2093.html Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text.

===Medieval glass in Europe===
{{see also|Poor Man's Bible|Medieval stained glass}}

Stained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the [[Middle Ages]] when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.

In the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and Early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. As [[Gothic architecture]] developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the [[Perpendicular style]] in England.

Integrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or [[rose window]], developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris and the "Bishop's Eye" at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].

While stained glass was widely manufactured, [[Chartres]] was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stained Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance, Reformation and Classical windows===
Probably the earliest scheme of stained glass windows that was created during the [[Renaissance]] was that for Florence Cathedral, devised by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].&lt;ref name=Lee1/&gt; The scheme includes three ocular windows for the dome and three for the facade which were designed from 1405 to 1445 by several of the most renowned artists of this period: [[Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Uccello]] and [[Andrea del Castagno]]. Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] or the [[Life of the Virgin|Life of the Virgin Mary]], surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, [[St Stephen]] and [[St Lawrence]]. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.&lt;ref name=Lee1&gt;Lee, Seddon and Stephens, pp. 118–121&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of [[Protestantism]]. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the [[Limoges]] factory, and in Italy at [[Murano]], where stained glass and faceted [[lead crystal]] are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.

At the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the injunctions of [[Thomas Cromwell]] against "abused images" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at [[Hengrave Hall]] in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century. See [[Stained glass – British glass, 1811–1918]] for more details.

In the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at [[Sint Janskerk|Grote Sint-Jan]] Church, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59&amp;nbsp;feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of [[Dirck Crabeth]] and his brother [[Wouter Crabeth|Wouter]]. Many of the original cartoons still exist.&lt;ref name=Vidimus1&gt;Vidimus, ''[http://vidimus.org/issues/issue-20/news/#sale-of-dirck-pieterz-crabeth-stained-glass-design Dirck Peterz.

===Revival in Britain===
{{main|British and Irish stained glass (1811–1918)}}
The Catholic revival in England, gaining force in the early 19th century with its renewed interest in the medieval church, brought a revival of church building in the Gothic style, claimed by [[John Ruskin]] to be "the true Catholic style". The architectural movement was led by [[Augustus Pugin|Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.

Among the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were [[William Warrington]] and [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman]] of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included [[William Wailes]], [[Ward and Hughes]], [[Clayton and Bell]], [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]] and [[Charles Eamer Kempe]]. A Scottish designer, [[Daniel Cottier]], opened firms in Australia and the US.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Revival in France===
{{see|List of French stained glass manufacturers}}
In France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the [[Sèvres]] porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand.
In France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri Gèrente and André Lusson.&lt;ref name= GC&gt;Gordon Campbell, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-518948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Revival===
During the mid- to late 19th century, many of Germany's ancient buildings were restored, and some, such as [[Cologne Cathedral]], were completed in the medieval style. There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;  A major firm was [[Mayer of Munich]], which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as [http://www.mayer-of-munich.com/ ''Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.'']. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

In the [[Austrian Empire]] and later [[Austria-Hungary]], one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as [[Carl Geyling's Erben]], which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and [[Royal Warrant of Appointment]] from emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].

===Innovations in Britain and Europe===
Among the most innovative English designers were the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], [[William Morris]] (1834–1898) and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833–1898), whose work heralds the influential Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peter Cormack, Arts &amp; Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts &amp; Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.

[[Art Nouveau]].
Art Nouveau or [[Belle Epoch]] stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of [[Francis Chigot]] of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal [[leadlight]] designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].

===Innovations in the United States===
{{Main|Tiffany glass}}

[[J&amp;R Lamb Studios]], established in 1857 in New York City, was the first major decorative arts studio in the United States and for many years a major producer of ecclesiastical stained glass.

Notable American practitioners include [[John La Farge]] (1835–1910), who invented [[opalescent glass]] and for which he received a U.S. patent on 24 February 1880, and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] (1848–1933), who received several patents for variations of the same opalescent process in November of the same year and is believed to have invented the copper foil method as an alternative to lead, and used it extensively in windows, lamps and other decorations. However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts &amp; Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the USA, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis &amp; Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Many 19th-century firms failed early in the 20th century as the Gothic movement was superseded by newer styles. At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the [[The Glass House (Fulham)|Glass House]] in London set up by [[Mary Lowndes]] and [[Alfred Drury (stained glass artist)|Alfred J. Drury]] and [[An Túr Gloine]] in Dublin, which was run by [[Sarah Purser]] and included artists such as [[Harry Clarke]].

A revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.

Other artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass, a technique known as [[Dalle de verre|Dalle de Verre]], where the glass is set in [[concrete]] or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] and brought to the UK by [[Pierre Fourmaintraux]]. One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Dominican Friar]] [[Dom Charles Norris]] OSB of [[Buckfast Abbey]].

[[Gemmail]], a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead [[came]]s to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Le grand dictionnaire Qu&amp;#233bec government's online dictionary entry for '&amp;#39;gemmail'&amp;#39; (in French) |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228139/gemmail Gemmail], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gemmail|Definition of Gemmail]]
Many famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably [[Picasso]], have been reproduced in gemmail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809295,00.html], Gemmail ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; A major exponent of this technique is the German artist [[Walter Womacka]].

Among the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an [[Abstract art]] form were [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter [[Marc Chagall]] produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include [[John Hayward (stained glass maker)|John Hayward]], [[Douglas Strachan]], [[Ervin Bossanyi]], [[Louis Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Geddes]], [[Karl Parsons]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Patrick Reyntiens]], [[Johannes Shreiter]], [[Judith Schaechter]], [[Paul Woodroffe]], [[Jean René Bazaine]] at [[Saint-Séverin (Paris)|Saint Séverin]], [[Sergio de Castro (artist)|Sergio de Castro]] at Couvrechef- La Folie ([[Caen]]), [[Hamburg-Dulsberg]] and [[Romont]] (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of [[Gabriel Loire]] at [[Chartres]]. The west windows of England's [[Manchester Cathedral]], by [[Tony Hollaway]], are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.

In Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of [[Johan Thorn Prikker]] and [[Josef Albers]], and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.&lt;ref name="Harrod-p452"&gt;Harrod, Tanya, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press (4 Feb 1999), {{ISBN|978-0300077803}}, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Ludwig Schaffrath]] demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass.  In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as [[Brian Clarke (artist)|Brian Clarke]] were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.&lt;ref name="Harrod-p452" /&gt;

In the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.

After the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK.

In the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is Kathy Bernard. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the program’s director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook [[Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium]]. The ''[[Roots of Knowledge]]'' installation at [[Utah Valley University]] in [[Orem, Utah]] is {{convert|200|ft|m}} long and has been compared to those in several European cathedrals, including the [[Cologne Cathedral]] in Germany, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in France, and [[York Minster]] in England.&lt;ref name="cnn 20161208"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/arts/roots-of-knowledge-stained-glass/|title=History illuminated: The evolution of knowledge told through 60,000 pieces of glass|first=Natasha|last=O'Hear|publisher=[[CNN|CNN.com]]|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=April 19, 2017|archivedate=20 April 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pquUVSNV?url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/arts/roots-of-knowledge-stained-glass/|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings incorporating stained glass windows==
===Churches===
Stained glass windows were commonly used in churches for decorative and informative purposes. Many windows are donated to churches by members of the congregation as memorials of loved ones. For more information on the use of stained glass to depict religious subjects, see [[Poor Man's Bible]].

&lt;!---NOTE Please don't add any church here that does not link to a wiki page. Only add examples that are absolutely OUTSTANDING for their time.---&gt;

===Synagogues===
In addition to Christian churches, stained glass windows have been incorporated into Jewish temple architecture for centuries.  Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed.  From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture.  Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.  As with churches, synagogue stained glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Houses===
Stained glass windows in houses were particularly popular in the [[Victorian era]] and many domestic examples survive. In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made ''[[cathedral glass]]'' which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured. Some large homes have splendid examples of secular pictorial glass. Many small houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries have [[leadlight]] windows.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Public and commercial buildings===
Stained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations. [[Public house]]s in some countries make extensive use of stained glass and leaded lights to create a comfortable atmosphere and retain privacy.

==History==
[[File:Parrish Hall.jpg|thumb|Parrish Hall, named in honor of the first president, [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872), contains the admissions, housing, and financial aid offices, along with student housing on the upper floors.]]
The name "Swarthmore" has its roots in early [[Quakers|Quaker]] history. In [[England]], [[Swarthmoor Hall]] near the town of [[Ulverston, England|Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]], (previously in [[Lancashire]]) was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when [[George Fox]], (1624–1691), fresh from his epiphany atop [[Pendle Hill]] in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmoor was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled "The Quakers").

The College was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]] Yearly Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872) was its first president. [[Lucretia Mott]] (1793–1880) and [[Martha Ellicott Tyson]] (1795–1873)&lt;ref name="msa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/tyson.html|title=Maryland Women's Hall of Fame: Martha Ellicott Tyson|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among those Friends, who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hope Bacon (1980), ''"Valiant Friend: The Life of Lucretia Mott"'', page 199, {{ISBN|1-888305-09-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, [[Helen Magill White|Helen Magill]], (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the [[United States]] to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, ([[PhD|Ph.D.]]); hers was in [[Greek language|Greek]] from [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ArchiveWomens2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|title=Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Faculty » Women's, Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies Program&amp;nbsp;– Boston University|publisher=web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035256/http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|archivedate=2013-10-12|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the College had a major collegiate [[Swarthmore Garnet Tide football|American football program]] during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport, (playing [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], ([[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]), [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[World War II]], Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] commission.&lt;ref name="swarthmore-v-122"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2010/02/19/swarthmore-at-war-part-1/|title=Daily Gazette|last=|first=|year=2011|publisher=[[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]]: Swarthmore College|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Köhler]], [[Hans Wallach]] and [[Solomon Asch]] were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left [[Nazi Germany]] because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his [[Asch conformity experiments|noted conformity experiments]] at Swarthmore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html|title=Asch Experiment|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings – the Sharples Dining Hall in 1964,  the Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and the Lang Music Building in 1973.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a 1969 black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day [[sit-in]] in the admissions office to demand increased black enrollment, and the establishment of the Black Cultural Center (1970) and the Women's Resource Center (1974).&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1969-black-student-protest-movement|title=1969 black student protest movement|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1975-alice-paul-05-and-womens-center|title=1975 Alice Paul '05 and the women's center|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996 and a renovation of the Trotter hall was undertaken in 1997.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 1999 the college began purchasing [[renewable energy credit]]s in the form of [[wind power]], and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first [[green roof]].&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 2008, Swarthmore's first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;

==Academics==
[[File:Swarthmore College Observatory.jpg|thumb|Observatory|left]]
Swarthmore's [[Oxbridge]] [[tutorial]]-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year and often write honors [[Thesis|theses]]. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded "Highest Honors"; others are either awarded "High Honors" or "Honors"; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program|title=Honors Program :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncommon for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an [[engineering]] program in which at the completion of four years' work, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include minors in [[peace and conflict studies]], [[cognitive science]], and [[Critical theory|interpretation theory]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.har.com/selective-liberal-arts-colleges--information-session-and-visit/event_E0-001-093360433-8|title=Selective Liberal Arts Colleges- Information Session and Visit   - HAR.com|last=Inc.|first=HRIS,|website=Homes And Rentals - HAR.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore has a total undergraduate student enrollment of 1,620 (for the 2016–2017 year) and 187 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses a year in over 40 courses of study.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Swarthmore has a reputation as a very academically oriented college, with 66% of students participating in undergraduate research or independent creative projects, and 90% of graduates eventually attending graduate or professional school.

==Campus==
[[File:Swarthmore_Parrish_Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Parrish Hall from Magill Walk]]
The campus consists of {{convert|425|acre|km2}}, based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses [[campus radio]] station [[WSRN-FM]] as well as the weekly student newspaper, ''The Phoenix''.  Many acres are wooded and include trails.

From the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] [[Swarthmore (SEPTA station)|Swarthmore commuter train station]] and the "ville" or borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the [[Scott Arboretum]], cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|title=Press Releases from|publisher=Greater Philadelphia Gardens|accessdate=2011-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131755/http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/16 "America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms of Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul, and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms of Wharton, Dana, Hallowell, and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall, the two non-residential fraternities (Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon), and various other buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/visitordash/campus_map.pdf|title=Visitors|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x4593.xml|title=Libraries|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1923, McCabe library has been a [[Federal Depository Library Program|Federal Depository library]] for selected U.S. Government documents.

===Friends Historical Library===
Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library|title=Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/|title=Swarthmore Historical Society|website=Swarthmore Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
Two Greek organizations exist on the campus in the form of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], [[Delta Upsilon]] and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]].

Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|title=Discrimination in the sorority system|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419163605/http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmorephoenix.com/?p=6702 Kappa Alpha Theta Chapter Official at Swarthmore | The Phoenix].

The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked "Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?" No action was taken on the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2013/02/26/17685/ StuCo Report: Referendum Not Binding | Daily Gazette]. Daily.swarthmore.edu (2013-02-26).

Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark "the Bird" Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Ralph Lee|date=March 1997|title=If I Had a Song…|url=http://bulletin.swarthmore.edu/bulletin-issue-archive/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_1997_03.pdf|format=pdf|magazine=Swarthmore College Bulletin|location=Swarthmore, PA|publisher=Swarthmore College|volume=XCIV|issn=0888-2126|access-date=September 8, 2016|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/ Cuts to athletic programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222092701/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/|date=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is "Oído al Tambor", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show "Rayuela", which has been running since September 2009.

===Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association===
Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmorefd.org/ems/|title=Swarthmore Fire &amp; Protective Association :: EMS|website=www.swarthmorefd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire horn is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/2016/03/11/monthly-swarthmore-history-contest-in-swarthmorean-fire-horn|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students affectionately refer to the noise as the call of the Fire Moose or the Space Whale, although the names themselves are in a constant state of evolution.

===Swarthmore College Computer Society===
Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|title=Swarthmore College Computer Society|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to operating a set of servers that provide e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space, and webspace to students, professors, alumni, and other student-run organizations, SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites, including the website of the student newspaper, ''The Daily Gazette''. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae's snack bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/about/|title=SCCS – About|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact====
In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a [[Slashdotting]] while hosting a copy of the [[Diebold Memos|Diebold memos]] on behalf of the student group [[Free Culture Swarthmore]], then known as the [[Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons]]. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant [[DMCA]] takedown request received by the college's ITS department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341683/|title=Swarthmore College's response to the DMCA takedown request|last=Konrad|first=Rachel|date=2003-10-27|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCCS was noted in PC Magazine's article "Top 20 Wired Colleges" as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2073408,00.asp|title=Top 20 Wired Colleges|work=PCMAG|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004–2005 school year, the SCCS Media Lounge served as the early home of War News Radio, a weekly webcast run by Swarthmore students and providing news about the Iraq war, providing resources, space, and technical support for the project in its infancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3652">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], '''syntagmatic analysis''' is [[Semantic analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of [[syntax]] or surface structure ([[syntagmatic structure]]) as opposed to [[paradigm]]s ([[paradigmatic analysis]]). This is often achieved using [[Commutation test (semiotics)|commutation test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html "Semiotics for Beginners" by Daniel Chandler]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Syntagmatic" means that one element selects the other element either to precede it or to follow it. For example, the [[the|definitive article]] "the" selects a [[noun]] and not a verb.

Of particular use in semiotic study, a syntagm is a chain which leads, through syntagmatic analysis, to an understanding of how a sequence of events forms a narrative. Alternatively, syntagmatic analysis can describe the spatial relationship of a visual text such as posters, photographs or a particular setting of a filmed scene.

[[Roland Barthes]] was able to use metaphor in the form of various garments in order to display how the syntagm/paradigm relationship worked together to at once create and change meaning. Expanding on this form of explanation by Barthes, both [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] and Susan Spiggle have further developed the metaphor, using specific wearable items. Shirt, shorts and sandals for example, are freely interchangeable along the plane of tops, bottoms and footwear, the paradigmatic plane, assuming they follow the rules of wearable items, the syntagmatic plane. While you can change the sandals for high heels, it would be breaking the rules to wear them as a top. Turning to the grammatically correct sentence, it prevents the text from reading like it was written by [[Yoda]].

==Application==

Due to the abstract nature of the [[Signifier and signified|signifier/signified]] relationship, a free-standing signifier is unable to convey knowledge or understanding by itself. After all, the only reason any word means what it means at all is due to a consensus of understanding by the wider community. Expanding on [[Saussure]]'s own example of the arbitrariness of the word "tree", or any word for that matter, it can be seen that the word "tree" by itself could mean just about any upright bit of wood with branches, whether it grows leaves or provides a place to hang cups or hats. Meaning is therefore provided by an extended syntagmatic chain, which will identify for the reader of the text just what sort of tree is meant.

This understanding leads to the opportunity to consider the linguistics of texts and language in a wider variety ways. Thwaite, Davis, and Mules identify a syntagm as "the result of using a conventional rule to combine a series of elements from various paradigms".&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Cultural and Media Studies. A Semiotic Approach by Thwaites, T, Davis, L, &amp; Mules, W&lt;/ref&gt; From this understanding it is possible to consider the structure of texts{{mdash}}film and television being an ideal example.

Looking at the [[mise-en-scène]] of a set piece, the various signs combine to give the viewer a greater understanding of what they are viewing. The syntagmatic chain is constructed in such a way that sets the feel of the scene and is particularly apparent when considering genre. A western for example may have many of the paradigmatic signs that the viewer has grown accustomed to. That everything is where they expect to see it is following the rules of this syntagmatic chain. If the horse is riding the cowboy, it breaks these rules and becomes a very different movie.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''''Tempo giusto''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtɛmpo ˈd͡ʒusto}}) is a musical term that means “in exact time”, often directing a return to strict time following a period of [[tempo rubato|rubato]]. or to play in “strict time” or “suitable time”.

==General==
The literal meaning of the term is 'in exact time'. Its most common meaning is to indicate a return to the main tempo after a temporary change (e.g. a [[rallentando]]).&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries ([[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|early Classical]]), ''tempo giusto'' referred to the idea that each [[Metre (music)|meter]] has its own 'ideal' tempo. The larger the beat value of the meter, the slower the tempo. Therefore, meters with beat values of a minim/half note (e.g. {{music|time|2|2}}, {{music|time|3|2}}) should be performed with a slow tempo; those with quaver/eighth note beats (e.g. {{music|time|3|8}}) are fast; while those with crotchet/quarter note beats (e.g. {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|4|4}}) are performed at a moderate or middling tempo.

The composer and music theorist [[Johann Kirnberger]] (1776) refined this idea by instructing the performer to consider the following details in combination when determining the best performance tempo of a piece: the tempo giusto of the meter, the tempo term (''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]'', ''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]]'', etc., if there is one, at the start of the piece), the particular rhythms in the piece (taking account of the longest and shortest notes), the 'character' of the piece, and the piece's genre (whether it was a [[minuet]], [[sarabande]], [[gigue]], etc.). In this way, an experienced musician could rely on his/her (informed) intuition to find the 'right' tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Kirnberger, Johann Philipp. 1771–76. Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik. 2 vols. Berlin: Christian Friedrich Boß. Reprint vol. 1 Berlin und Königsberg: G. J. Decker und G. L. Hartung, 1774. Trans. David Beach and Jurgen Thym. 1982. The Art of Strict Musical Composition.  New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, a composer will mark a piece ''tempo giusto'' to request the performer to use his/her experience in this way: that is, to intuit the correct tempo from the structure and nature of the piece itself.&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-18th century, the notion of each meter having an 'ideal tempo' fell out of fashion, as composers started preferring to indicate tempo with tempo terms and (later, in the nineteenth century) with [[Metronome marking|metronome markings]].

==Life Movement==

Although tempo giusto is only sparsely sprinkled through musical time, it has recently reemerged.  The term has given rise to a whole life movement, which advises the modern world to stop plowing through life at breakneck speed, and to start living instead at the “right tempo." Man is told to live in accordance with his own inner tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl. ''In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed.'' San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic director of the [[Madison Symphony Orchestra]], Maestro [[John DeMain]], has said, “[n]ow that I think about it, the idea of tempo giusto describes just about everything I do or aspire to."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jess. "John DeMain: In Search of Tempo Giusto." ''Madison Magazine, August 2001.'' http://www.madisonmusicreviews.org/doc/p_200108_demain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Non-GMO Project''' is a [[501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] focusing on [[genetically modified]] organisms. The organization began as an initiative of independent [[natural foods]] retailers in the U.S. and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nongmoproject.org/about/governance/board-of-directors/ Board of Directors The Non-GMO Project]&lt;/ref&gt; with the stated aim to label products produced in compliance with their Non-GMO Project Standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nongmoproject.org/product-verification/non-gmo-project-standard/ |title=The Standard – The Non-GMO Project |publisher=Nongmoproject.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to prevent genetically modified foodstuffs from being present in retail food products. The organization is headquartered in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. The Non-GMO label began use in 2012 with [[Numi Organic Tea]] products.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nongmoproject.org/blog/numi-organic-tea-brews-pure-tea-precedent-with-non-gmo-verification/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Eenennaam, A.L., and A.E. Young. 2014. Prevalence and impacts of genetically engineered feedstuffs on livestock populations. J Anim. Sci. 92:4255-4278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, two natural food retailers formed the project, with a goal of creating a standardized definition for non-genetically modified organisms.&lt;ref name="FCN"&gt;[https://www.agra-net.com/agra/food-chemical-news/article393081.ece "Natural" food retailers to set non-biotech standard], ''Food Chemical News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nongmoproject.org/about/history/ |title=History – The Non-GMO Project |publisher=Nongmoproject.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project worked with FoodChain Global Advisors which provided the scientific and technical expertise. In spring 2007, the project's board of directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nongmoproject.org/about/governance/board-of-directors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004231001/http://www.nongmoproject.org/about/governance/board-of-directors/ |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expanded to include representatives from additional groups, and formed advisory boards for technical and policy issues.&lt;ref name="Project"&gt;[http://www.nongmoproject.org/about/history/ The Non-GMO Project History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Non-GMO Project's stated mission is "to preserve and build sources of non-GMO products, educate consumers, and provide verified non-GMO choices". It provides third-party verification and labeling for non-genetically modified food and products. The project also works with food manufacturers, distributors, growers, and seed suppliers to develop standards for detection of genetically modified organisms and for the reduction of contamination risk of the non-genetically modified food supply with genetically modified organisms. FoodChain Global Advisors, a part of Global ID Group, provides the technical capabilities.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;The Organic &amp; Non-GMO Report.

Part of its mission is to "educate consumers and the food industry to help build awareness about GMOs and their impact on our health".&lt;ref name=about/&gt; It claims that everyone deserves an informed choice about whether or not to consume genetically modified organisms.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nongmoproject.org/about/|title=Non-GMO Project: About|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q+A with Megan Westgate|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_18553038?IADID=Search-www.dailycamera.com-www.dailycamera.com|publisher=Daily Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary strategy for providing consumers an informed choice and protecting a non-genetically modified food supply is to leverage the power of the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeking Food Ingredients That Aren't Gene-Altered|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/business/food-companies-seeking-ingredients-that-arent-gene-altered.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard and label==
The Non-GMO Project maintains a consensus-based standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nongmoproject.org/product-verification/the-standard/ |title=The Standard – The Non-GMO Project |publisher=Nongmoproject.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines their system for ensuring best practices for avoiding genetically modified organisms. Methods such as segregation, traceability, [[risk assessment]], [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling techniques]], and [[quality control]] management are emphasized in the Standard.

The project's Product Verification Program assesses ingredients, products, and manufacturing facilities to establish compliance with the standard. All ingredients with major risk must be tested for compliance with the Non-GMO Project Standard prior to their use in a Non-GMO Project Verified Product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Westgate|first=Megan|title=Top 3 Things to Know About the Non-GMO Project|url=http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/top-3-things-know-about-non-gmo-project|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is managed through a web-based application and evaluation program developed for the project.&lt;ref name="GTN"&gt;"Global ID was engaged by the Non-GMO Project to design and administer a non-GMO verification program."

==Sales==
According to the Non-GMO Project, as of September 2013, Project Verified products exceeded $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion. This would be approximately 0.4% of the total food sales in the United States ($1.3&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Expenditures|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditures.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Non-GMO Project reports 797 verification program enrollment inquiries in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 194 inquiries during the same period in 2012, representing more than a 300% increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nongmoproject.org/2013/09/17/non-gmo-project-moves-to-expand-verification-capabilities/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226032926/http://www.nongmoproject.org/2013/09/17/non-gmo-project-moves-to-expand-verification-capabilities/ |archivedate=2013-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Non-GMO Project has been known to put its labels on products that are either well known to have no genetically modified variant available, such as tomatoes, oranges, blueberries, and coffee, or on foods where genetic modification isn't even relevant, such as water, and may be using a business model that is based on fear and lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agweek.com/opinion/4294420-non-gmo-project-creating-fake-news-grocery-store]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies such as [[Cargill]] have admitted that they have only paid to have this logo on their products for marketing reasons even if it was misleading and confused customers, and further acknowledged that it is putting science aside while doing so.&lt;ref&gt;https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/non-gmo-project-labeling-group-wants-shrink-market-gmo-foods-limit-biotech-movement/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|[[Perfect authentic cadence]] (IV–V–I [[chord progression]], in which we see the chords F major, G major, and then C major, in four-part harmony) in C major {{audio|IV-V-I in C.mid|Play}}. "Tonal music is built around these tonic and dominant arrival points [cadences], and they form one of the fundamental building blocks of musical structure" {{harv|Benjamin, Horvitz, and Nelson|2008|loc=63}}.]]

'''Tonality''' is the arrangement of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and/or [[chord (music)|chords]] of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality. In this hierarchy, the single pitch or [[triad (music)|triadic chord]] with the greatest stability is called the [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. The [[root (music)|root]] of the tonic chord forms the name given to the [[key (music)|key]]; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and the root of the tonic chord (which is C–E–G). Simple [[folk music]] songs often start and end with the tonic note. The most common use of the term "is to designate the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in [[Classical music|European music]] from about 1600 to about 1910" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}. [[Contemporary classical music]] from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality—but [[harmony]] in almost all Western [[popular music]] remains tonal.{{Vague|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--There are several; different senses of "tonality" defined in this article (see the "vague" flag on the Tagg quotation in the next paragraph, and the article's caution about context where the quotation is repeated in the body.--&gt; Harmony in [[jazz music|jazz]] includes many but not all tonal characteristics of the European [[Common practice period|common practice]] period, sometimes known as "classical music".

"All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without [[Diatonic function|function]]" {{harv|Tagg|2003|loc=534}}.{{Vague|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--There are eight senses of "tonality" specified in the body of the article, all of which (including the modal practice of pre-modern church music and twelve-tone technique) could potentially fulfill this description. To which of these does Tagg refer?--&gt;
Tonality is an organized system of tones (e.g., the tones of a major or minor scale) in which one tone (the tonic) becomes the central point for the remaining tones. The other tones in a tonal piece are all defined in terms of their relationship to the tonic. In tonality, the tonic (tonal center) is the tone of complete relaxation and stability, the target toward which other tones lead {{harv|Benward &amp; Saker|2003|loc=36}}. The [[cadence (music)|cadence]] (coming to rest point) in which the [[dominant chord]] or [[dominant seventh]] chord resolves to the tonic chord plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece. "Tonal music is music that is ''unified'' and ''dimensional''. Music is unified if it is exhaustively referable to a precompositional system generated by a single constructive principle derived from a basic scale-type; it is dimensional if it can nonetheless be distinguished from that precompositional ordering" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=299}}.

The term ''tonalité'' originated with [[Alexandre-Étienne Choron|Alexandre-Étienne]] {{harvtxt|Choron|1810}} and was borrowed by [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in 1840 ({{harvnb|Reti|1958|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2009}}}}; {{harvnb|Simms|1975|loc=119}}; {{harvnb|Judd|1998a|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Heyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}}). According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]], however, the term ''tonalité'' was only coined by [[Castil-Blaze]] in 1821 ({{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1967|loc=960}}; {{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1980|loc=51}}). Although Fétis used it as a general term for a system of musical organization and spoke of ''types de tonalités'' rather than a single system, today the term is most often used to refer to [[Major and minor|major–minor]] tonality, the system of musical organization of the common practice period. Major-minor tonality is also called ''harmonic tonality'' (in the title of Carl {{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1990}}, translating the German ''harmonische Tonalität''), ''diatonic tonality'', ''common practice tonality'', ''functional tonality'', or just ''tonality''.

== Characteristics and features ==
At least eight distinct senses of the word "tonality" (and corresponding adjective, "tonal"), some mutually exclusive, have been identified {{harv|Hyer|2001}}: {{vague|date=March 2015|reason=Who identified these senses? Where did they find them used?}}

=== Systematic organization ===
First, the word tonality may describe any systematic organization of pitch phenomena in any music at all, including pre-17th century western music as well as much non-western music, such as music based on the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] pitch collections of Indonesian [[gamelan]], or employing the modal nuclei of the [[Arabic maqam]] or the Indian [[raga]] system.

This sense also applies to the tonic/dominant/subdominant harmonic harmonic constellations in the theories of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] as well as the 144 basic transformations of [[twelve-tone technique]]. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become "evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers".{{harv|Perle|1991|loc=8}}

For the composer and theorist [[George Perle]], tonality is not "a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=291}}. This sense (like some of the others) is susceptible to ideological employment, as Schoenberg, did by relying on the idea of a progressive development in musical resources "to compress divergent ''fin-de-siècle'' compositional practices into a single historical lineage in which his own music brings one historical era to a close and begins the next." From this point of view, twelve-tone music could  be regarded "either as the natural and inevitable culmination of an organic motivic process ([[Anton Webern|Webern]]) or as a historical ''Aufhebung'' ([[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]), the dialectical synthesis of late Romantic motivic practice on the one hand with a musical sublimation of tonality as pure system on the other" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Theoretical arrangement of pitches ===
In another sense, tonality means any rational and self-contained [[Music theory|theoretical arrangement]] of musical pitches, existing prior to any concrete embodiment in music.

For example, "Sainsbury, who had Choron translated into English in 1825, rendered the first occurrence of tonalité as a 'system of modes' before matching it with the neologism 'tonality'. While tonality qua system constitutes a theoretical (and thus imaginative) abstraction from actual music, it is often hypostatized in musicological discourse, converted from a theoretical structure into a musical reality. In this sense, it is understood as a Platonic form or prediscursive musical essence that suffuses music with intelligible sense, which exists before its concrete embodiment in music, and can thus be theorized and discussed apart from actual musical contexts" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Contrast with modal and atonal systems ===
A third sense is a term to contrast with "[[Mode (music)|modal]]" and "[[Atonality|atonal]]", the term tonality is used to imply that tonal music is discontinuous as a form of cultural expression from modal music (before 1600) on the one hand and atonal music (after 1910) on the other.

=== Pre-modern concept ===
In some literature, a fourth sense of tonality is a generic term applied to pre-modern music, referring to the eight modes of the Western church, implying that important historical continuities underlie music before and after the emergence of [[musical modernism]] around 1600, with the difference between ''tonalité ancienne'' (before 1600) and ''tonalité moderne'' (after 1600) being one of emphasis rather than of kind.

=== Referential tonic ===
Fifth, in a general way, tonality can refer to a wide variety of musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) as arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic.

=== Tonal theories ===
In a sixth, slightly different sense to the one above, tonality can also be used to refer to musical phenomena perceived or preinterpreted in terms of the categories of tonal theories.

This is a psychophysical sense, where for example "listeners tend to hear a given pitch as, for instance, an&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; A above middle C, an augmented 4th above E{{Music|flat}}, the minor 3rd in an F{{Music|sharp}} minor triad, a dominant in relation to D, or {{music|scale|2}} (where the caret designates a scale degree) in G major rather than a mere acoustical frequency, in this case 440 Hz" {{harv|Hyer|2001}}.

=== Synonym for "key" ===
Seventh, the word tonality has more recently been used by amateur musicians and in [[popular music]] as a synonym for "[[key (music)|key]]"—in this sense meaning "keyness"

This is the most common usage, referring to the arrangement of musical phenomena around a referential tonic, as found in European music from about 1600 to about 1910, using two modal genera, [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]]

=== Other perspectives ===
Eighth, there is a loose assortment of ideas associated with the term.

"Tonal harmonies must always include the third of the chord" {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=46}}.

In major and minor harmonies, the [[perfect fifth]] is often implied and understood by the listener even if it is not present. To function as a tonic, a chord must be either a major or a minor triad. Dominant function requires a major-quality triad with a root a perfect fifth above the affiliated tonic and containing the leading tone of the key. This dominant triad must be preceded by a chord progression that establishes the dominant as the penultimate goal of a motion that is completed by moving on to the tonic. In this final dominant-to-tonic progression, the leading tone normally ascends by semitone motion to the tonic scale degree ({{harvnb|Berry|1976|loc=54}}; {{harvnb|Brown|2005|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Burnett and Nitzberg|2007|loc=97}}; {{harvnb|Rogers|2004|loc=47}}). A dominant seventh chord always consist of a major triad with an added minor seventh above the root. To achieve this in minor keys, the seventh scale degree must be raised to create a major triad on the dominant ({{harvnb|Duckworth|2015|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Mayfield|2013|loc=94}}).

[[David Cope|David]] {{harvtxt|Cope|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2009}}}} considers key, [[consonance and dissonance]] (relaxation and tension, respectively), and hierarchical relationships the three most basic concepts in tonality.

Carl Dahlhaus {{harv|Dahlhaus|1990|loc=102}} lists the characteristic schemata of tonal harmony, "typified in the compositional formulas of the 16th and early 17th centuries," as the "complete cadence" I–[[ii–V–I]], [[I–IV–V–I]], I–IV–I–V–I; the [[circle of fifths]] progression I–IV–vii°–iii–[[vi–ii–V–I]]; and the major–minor parallelism: minor v–i–VII–III equals major iii–vi–V–I; or minor III–VII–i–v equals major I–V–vi–iii. The last of these progressions is characterized by "retrograde" harmonic motion.

=== Form ===
{{Main|Musical form}}

=== Consonance and dissonance ===
{{Main|Consonance and dissonance}}
The consonance and dissonance of different intervals plays an important role in establishing the tonality of a piece or section in [[common practice music]] and [[popular music]]. For example, for a simple [[folk music]] song in the key of C Major, almost all of the triadic chords in the song will be Major or minor chords which are stable and consonant (e.g., in the key of C Major, commonly-used chords will included D minor, F Major, G Major, etc.). The most commonly used dissonant chord in a pop song context is the [[dominant seventh]] chord built on the fifth scale degree; in the key of C Major, this would be a G dominant seventh chord, or G7 chord, which contains the pitches G, B, D and F. This dominant seventh chord contains a dissonant [[tritone]] interval between the notes B and F. In pop music, the listener will expect this tritone to be resolved to a consonant, stable chord (in this case, typically a C Major [[cadence (music)|cadence]] (coming to rest point) or a [[deceptive cadence]] to an A minor chord).

=== Tonal musics ===
"The larger portion of the world's folk and art music can be categorized as tonal," as long as the definition is as follows: "Tonal music gives priority to a single tone or tonic. In this kind of music all the constituent tones and resulting tonal relationships are heard and identified relative to their tonic" {{harv|Susanni|2012|loc=66}}. In this sense, "All harmonic idioms in popular music are tonal, and none is without function" {{harv|Tagg|2003|loc=534}}. However, "within the continuing hegemony of tonality there is evidence for a relatively separate tradition of genuine folk musics, which do not operate completely or even mainly according to the assumptions or rules of tonality. … throughout the reign of tonality there seem to have existed subterranean folk musical traditions organized on principles different from tonality, and often modal: Celtic songs and blues are obvious examples" {{harv|Shepherd, Virden, Vulliamy, and Wishart|1977|loc=156}}.

According to Allan {{harvtxt|Moore|1995|loc=191}}, "part of the heritage of rock lies within common-practice tonality" {{harv|Burns|2000|loc=213}} but, because the [[leading-tone|leading-note]]/tonic relationship is "axiomatic to the definition of common-practice tonality", and a fundamental feature of rock music's identity is the absence of a diatonic leading tone, the harmonic practices of rock music, "while sharing many features with classical tonality, are nonetheless distinct" {{harv|Moore|1995|loc=187}}. Power chords are especially problematic when trying to apply classical functional tonality to certain varieties of popular music. Genres such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[punk rock]], and [[grunge music]] "took power chords into new arenas, often with a reduced emphasis on tonal function. These genres are often expressed in two parts—a bass line doubled in fifths, and a single vocal part. Power chord technique was often allied with modal procedure" {{harv|Everett|2000|loc= 331}}.

Much jazz is tonal, but "functional tonality in jazz has different properties than that of common-practice classical music. These properties are represented by a unique set of rules dictating the unfolding of harmonic function, voice-leading conventions, and the overall behavior of chord tones and chordal extensions" {{harv|Terefenko|2014|loc=26}}.

== History and theory ==
=== 18th century ===
[[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''Treatise on Harmony'' (1722) is the earliest effort to explain tonal harmony through a coherent system based on acoustical principles {{harv|Girdlestone|1969|loc=520}}, built upon the functional unit being the [[triad (music)|triad]], with inversions.

=== 19th century ===
The term "tonalité" (tonality) was first used in 1810 by Alexandre Choron in the preface "Sommaire de l'histoire de la musique" {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}} to the "Dictionnaire historique des musiciens artistes et amateurs" (which he published in collaboration with [[:fr:François-Joseph-Marie Fayolle|François-Joseph-Marie Fayolle]]) to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic—a constellation that had been made familiar by Rameau. According to Choron, this pattern, which he called ''tonalité moderne'', distinguished modern music's harmonic organization from that of earlier [pre 17th century] music, including "tonalité des Grecs" (ancient Greek modes) and "tonalité ecclésiastique" (plainchant) ({{harvnb|Choron|1810|loc=xxxvii–xl}}; {{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}). According to Choron, the beginnings of this modern tonality are found in the music of [[Claudio Monteverdi]] around the year 1595, but it was more than a century later that the full application of tonal harmony finally supplanted the older reliance on the melodic orientation of the church modes, in the music of the [[Neapolitan School]]—most especially that of [[Francesco Durante]] {{harv|Choron|1810|loc=xxxviii, xl}}.

François-Joseph Fétis developed the concept of ''tonalité'' in the 1830s and 1840s {{harv|Brown|2005|loc=xiii}}, finally codifying his theory of tonality in 1844, in his ''Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie'' ({{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Wangermée and Ellis|2001}}). Fétis saw ''tonalité moderne'' as the historically evolving phenomenon with three stages: tonality of ''ordre transitonique'' ("transitonic order"), of ''ordre pluritonique'' ("pluritonic order") and, finally, ''ordre omnitonique'' ("omnitonic order"). The "transitonic" phase of tonality he connected with the late [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]. He described his earliest example of ''tonalité moderne'' thus: "In the passage quoted here from Monteverdi's madrigal (''Cruda amarilli'', mm. 9–19 and 24–30), one sees a tonality determined by the ''accord parfait'' [root position major chord] on the tonic, by the sixth chord assigned to the chords on the third and seventh degrees of the scale, by the optional choice of the ''accord parfait'' or the sixth chord on the sixth degree, and finally, by the ''accord parfait'' and, above all, by the unprepared seventh chord (with major third) on the dominant" {{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=171}}. Among most subtle representatives of "pluritonic order" there were Mozart and Rossini; this stage he saw as the culmination and perfection of ''tonalité moderne''. The romantic tonality of Berlioz and especially Wagner he related to "omnitonic order" with its "insatiable desire for modulation" {{harv|Hyer|2002|loc=748}}. His prophetic vision of the omnitonic order (though he didn't approve it personally) as the way of further development of tonality was a remarkable innovation to historic and theoretic concepts of the 19th century {{harv|Simms|1975|loc=132}}.

''Tonalité ancienne'' Fetis described as tonality of ''ordre unitonique'' (establishing one key and remaining in that key for the duration of the piece). The principal example of this "unitonic order" tonality he saw in the Western plainchant.

Fétis believed that tonality, ''tonalité moderne'', was entirely cultural, saying, "For the elements of music, nature provides nothing but a multitude of tones differing in pitch, duration, and intensity by the greater or least degree&amp;nbsp;... The conception of the relationships that exist among them is awakened in the intellect, and, by the action of sensitivity on the one hand, and will on the other, the mind coordinates the tones into different series, each of which corresponds to a particular class of emotions, sentiments, and ideas. Hence these series become various types of tonalities."{{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=11–12}} "But one will say, 'What is the principle behind these scales, and what, if not acoustic phenomena and the laws of mathematics, has set the order of their tones?' I respond that this principle is purely metaphysical [anthropological]. We conceive this order and the melodic and harmonic phenomena that spring from it out of our conformation and education."{{harv|Fétis|1844|loc=249}}

Fétis' "Traité complet" was very popular. In France alone the book was printed between 1844 and 1903 twenty times. The 1st edition was printed in Paris and Brussels in 1844, the 9th edition was printed in [https://archive.org/details/traitcompletde00ft Paris in 1864], and the 20th edition was printed in Paris in 1903. For more bibliographical information, see [http://www.worldcat.org/title/traite-complet-de-la-theorie-et-de-la-pratique-de-lharmonie-contenant-la-doctrine-de-la-science-et-de-lart/oclc/9892650/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br worldcat.org].

In contrast, Hugo Riemann believed tonality, "affinities between tones" or ''Tonverwandtschaften'', was entirely natural and, following [[Moritz Hauptmann|Moritz]] {{harvtxt|Hauptmann|1853}}, that the major third and perfect fifth were the only "directly intelligible" intervals, and that I, IV, and V, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant were related by the perfect fifths between their root notes {{harv|Dahlhaus|1990|loc=101–02}}.

It is in this era that the word ''tonality'' was popularized by Fétis {{harv|Wangermée and Ellis|2001}}.

Theorists such as [[Hugo Riemann]], and later [[Edward Lowinsky|Edward]] {{harvtxt|Lowinsky|1962}} and others, pushed back the date when modern tonality began, and the [[cadence (music)|cadence]] began to be seen as the definitive way that a tonality is established in a work of music {{harv|Judd|1998}}.

In the music of some late-Romantic or [[post-Romantic]] composers such as [[Richard Wagner]], [[Hugo Wolf]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], and others, we find a variety of harmonic and linear procedures that have the effect of weakening functional tonality. These procedures may produce a suspension of tonality or may create a sense of tonal ambiguity, even to the point that at times the sense of tonality is completely lost. [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] described this kind of tonality (with references to the music of Wagner, Mahler, and himself, amongst others) as "aufgehobene Tonalität" and "schwebende Tonalität" {{harv|Schoenberg|1922|loc=444, 459–60}}, usually rendered in English as "suspended" ("not in effect", "cancelled") tonality and "fluctuating" ("suspended", "not yet decided") tonality, respectively {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=383}}.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, the tonality that had prevailed since the 17th century was seen to have reached a crisis or break down point. Because of the "...increased use of the ambiguous chords, the less probable harmonic progressions, and the more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections,"{{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=241}} the syntax of functional harmony loosened to the point where, "At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure; at worst, they were approaching a uniformity which provided few guides for either composition or listening."{{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=241}}

Tonality may be considered generally, with no restrictions on the date or place the music was produced, and little restriction on the materials and methods used. This definition includes pre-17th century western music, as well as much non-western music. By the middle of the 20th century, it had become "evident that triadic structure does not necessarily generate a tone center, that non-triadic harmonic formations may be made to function as referential elements, and that the assumption of a twelve-tone complex does not preclude the existence of tone centers" {{harv|Perle|1991|loc=8}}. For the composer and theorist [[George Perle]], tonality is not "a matter of 'tone-centeredness', whether based on a 'natural' hierarchy of pitches derived from the overtone series or an 'artificial' pre compositional ordering of the pitch material; nor is it essentially connected to the kinds of pitch structures one finds in traditional diatonic music" {{harv|Pitt|1995|loc=291}}.

== Theoretical underpinnings ==

One area of disagreement going back to the origin of the term tonality is whether tonality is ''natural'' or inherent in acoustical phenomena, whether it is inherent in the human nervous system or a psychological construct, whether it is inborn or learned, and to what degree it is all these things {{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=236}}. A viewpoint held by many theorists since the third quarter of the 19th century, following the publication in 1862 of the first edition of Helmholtz's ''On the Sensation of Tone'' {{harv|Helmholtz|1877}}, holds that diatonic scales and tonality arise from natural overtones ({{harvnb|Riemann|1872}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1875}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1882}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1893}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1905}}, {{harvnb|Riemann|1914–15}}; {{harvnb|Schenker|1906–35}}; {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937–70}}).

[[Rudolph Réti]] differentiates between harmonic tonality of the traditional kind found in [[homophony]], and melodic tonality, as in [[monophony]]. In the harmonic kind, tonality is produced through the [[dominant (music)|V]]-[[tonic (music)|I]] [[chord progression]], &lt;d&gt; &lt;t&gt;. He argues that in the progression I-x-V-I (and all progressions), V-I is the only step "which ''as such'' produces the effect of tonality," and that all other chord successions, diatonic or not, being more or less similar to the tonic-dominant, are "the composer's free invention." He describes melodic tonality (the term coined independently and 10 years earlier by Estonian composer [[Jaan Soonvald]] {{harv|Rais|1992|loc=46}}) as being "entirely different from the classical type," wherein, "the whole line is to be understood as a musical unit mainly through its relationship to this basic note [the tonic]," this note not always being the tonic as interpreted according to harmonic tonality. His examples are ancient Jewish and [[Gregorian chant]] and other Eastern music, and he points out how these melodies often may be interrupted at any point and returned to the tonic, yet harmonically tonal melodies, such as that from Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' below, are actually "strict [[Harmonic rhythm|harmonic-rhythmic]] pattern[s]," and include many points "from which it is impossible, that is, illogical, unless we want to destroy the innermost sense of the whole line" to return to the tonic ({{harvnb|Reti|1958}}, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}).

Consequently, he argues, melodically tonal melodies resist harmonization and only reemerge in western music after, "harmonic tonality was abandoned," as in the music of [[Claude Debussy]]: "melodic tonality plus [[modulation (music)|modulation]] is [Debussy's] modern tonality" {{harv|Reti|1958|loc=23}}.

== Outside common-practice period ==
The noun "tonality" and adjective "tonal" are widely applied also, in studies of early and modern Western music, and in non-Western traditional music ([[Arabic maqam]], Indian [[raga]], Indonesian [[slendro]] etc.), to the "systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them" ({{harvnb|Hyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hyer|2002}}). Felix Wörner, Ullrich Scheideler, and Philip Rupprecht in the introduction to a collection of essays dedicated to the concept and practice of tonality between 1900 and 1950 describe it generally as "the awareness of key in music" {{harv|Wörner, Scheideler, and Rupprecht|2012|loc=11}}.

[[Harold Powers]], in a series of articles, used terms "sixteenth-century tonalities" ({{harvnb|Powers|1981|loc=439}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1992|loc=12}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1996|loc=221}}) and "Renaissance tonality" {{harv|Powers|1996|loc=226}}. He borrowed German "Tonartentyp" from [[:de:Siegfried Hermelink|Siegfried]] {{harvtxt|Hermelink|1960}}, who related it to Palestrina, translated it into English as "tonal type" {{harv|Powers|1981|loc=439}}, and systematically applied the concept of "tonal types" to Renaissance sacred and paraliturgical polyphony. Cristle Collins Judd (the author of many articles and a thesis dedicated to the early pitch systems) found "tonalities" in this sense in motets of [[Josquin Desprez]] {{harv|Judd|1992}}. Judd also wrote of "chant-based tonality" {{harv|Judd|1998c}}, meaning "tonal" polyphonic compositions based on plainchant. Peter Lefferts found "tonal types" in the French polyphonic chanson of the 14th century {{harv|Lefferts|1995}}, Italian musicologists Marco Mangani and Daniele Sabaino in the late Renaissance music {{harv|Mangani and Sabaino|2008}}, and so on.

The wide usage of "tonality" and "tonal" has been supported by several other musicologists (of diverse provenance); it can be traced, e.g., in the articles collected in {{harvnb|Judd|1998a}}. A possible reason for this broader usage of terms "tonality" and "tonal" is the attempt to translate German "Tonart" as "tonality" and "Tonarten-" prefix as "tonal" (for example, it is rendered so in the seminal ''New Grove'' article "Mode", {{harvnb|Powers et al.|2001|loc=§V, 1, et passim}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1981|loc=441}}; {{harvnb|Powers|1982|loc=59, 61}} etc.). Therefore, two different German words "Tonart" and "Tonalität" have sometimes been translated as "tonality" although they are not the same words in German.

[[File:Hugo Riemann, "Tonalität," Musik-Lexikon (1882) PNG.png|thumb|Riemann's illustration of a non-diatonic cadence possessing ''Tonalität'' without ''Tonart'' {{harv|Kopp|2011|loc=401}} {{audio|Hugo Riemann, "Tonalität," Musik-Lexikon (1882) MID.mid|Play}}]]
In 1882, Hugo Riemann defined the term ''Tonalität'' specifically to include chromatic as well as diatonic relationships to a tonic, in contrast to the usual diatonic concept of ''Tonart''. In the [[neo-Riemannian theory]] of the late 20th century, however, the same chromatic chord relations cited by Riemann came to be regarded as a fundamental example of nontonal triadic relations, reinterpreted as a product of the hexatonic cycle (the six-pitch-class set forming a scale of alternating minor thirds and semitones, [[Forte number|Forte's set-type]] 6–20, but manifested as a succession of from four to six alternating major and minor triads), defined without reference to a tonic ({{harvnb|Cohn|1996|loc=18, et passim}}; {{harvnb|Kopp|2011|loc=401}}).

In the 20th century, music that no longer conformed to the strict definition of common-practice tonality could nevertheless still involve musical phenomena (harmonies, cadential formulae, harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, formal categories) arranged or understood in relation to a referential tonic {{harv|Hyer|2001}}. For example, the closing bars of the first movement of [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta]]'' do not involve a composed-out triad, but rather a diverging-converging pair of chromatic lines moving from a unison A to an octave E{{Music|flat}} and back to a unison A again, providing a framing "deep structure" based on a tritone relationship that nevertheless is not analogous to a tonic-dominant axis, but rather remains within the single functional domain of the tonic, A {{harv|Agawu|2009|loc=72}}. To distinguish this species of tonality (found also, for example, in the music of [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein|Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Irving Fine|Fine]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], and, especially, Stravinsky) from the stricter kind associated with the 18th century, some writers use the term "[[neotonality]]" ({{harvnb|Burkholder, Grout, and Palisca|2009|loc=838, 885}}; {{harvnb|Silberman|2006|loc=v, 2, 33, 37, 58, 65, 108}}), while others prefer to use the term ''centricity'' {{harv|Straus|2000|loc=112–14}}, and still others retain the term, ''tonality'' {{harv|White|1979|loc=558}}, in its broader sense, or use word combinations like ''extended tonality'' ({{harvnb|Kholopov}}; {{harvnb|Lyzhov}}).

== Computational methods to determine the key ==
In [[music information retrieval]], techniques have been developed to determine the key of a piece of [[Classical music|classical Western music]] (recorded in audio data format) automatically. These methods are often based on a compressed representation of the pitch content in a 12-dimensional [[pitch-class]] profile (chromagram) and a subsequent procedure that finds the best match between this representation and one of the prototype vectors of the 24 minor and major keys {{harv|Purwins, Blankertz, and Obermayer|2000|loc=270–72}}. For implementation, often the [[constant-Q transform]] is used, displaying the musical signal on a log frequency scale. Although a radical (over)simplification of the concept of tonality, such methods can predict the key of classical Western music well for most pieces. Other methods also take into consideration the sequentiality of music.

The '''University of California, Santa Cruz''' (also known as '''UC Santa Cruz''' or '''UCSC''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  It is one of 10 campuses in the [[University of California]] system. Located 75 miles (120&amp;nbsp;km) south of San Francisco at the edge of the coastal community of Santa Cruz, the campus lies on {{convert|2001|acres|ha}} of rolling, forested hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean and [[Monterey Bay]].

Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz began as a showcase for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.

==History==
Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the [[Regents of the University of California|University of California Regents]] in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref name="City council hasn't told"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Doyle | first = William T.| title = What the city council has not told us about university expansion| newspaper = Santa Cruz Sentinel| publisher = MediaNews Group| date = October 1, 2006| url = http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=42181| accessdate =February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Santa Cruz site was selected over a competing proposal to build the campus closer to the population center of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

===Impact on Santa Cruz===
Although the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] already exhibited a strong [[conservation ethic]] before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=27810|title=35 years later, students’ environmental report seems prescient|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 3, 2008|last=Seals|first=Brian|date=July 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc.&lt;ref name="Burchins3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40020|title=1980s ushered in discussion of UCSC expansion that continues today |newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 9, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large and growing population of politically [[progressivism|liberal]] UCSC [[alumnus|alumni]] changed the electorate of the town from predominantly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Honig|first=Tom|title=Santa Cruz was once Reagan country|date=June 4, 2004|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to markedly [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]], consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both [[town and gown]].

===Expansion plans===
{{main|Long Range Development Plan (UCSC)}}
Plans for increasing enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 faculty and staff by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Marshall | first=Carolyn | title=As College Grows, a City Is Asking, ‘Who Will Pay?’ | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/us/19campus.html | date=January 27, 2007 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40191|title=Tie-dyed philosophy majors of the past make way for pencil-protected science majors|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 16, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.&lt;ref name="bookwalter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|title=Suits over UCSC growth settled: City, county, neighbors reach deal; university agrees to concessions over roads, water and housing|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=August 9, 2008|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=September 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815200839/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|archive-date=August 15, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intends to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[NASA Ames Research Center]] campus is planned to ultimately hold 2,000 UCSC students – about 10% of the entire university's future student body as envisioned for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Krieger | first= Lisa M. | title= Think of UCSC as UC-Silicon Valley, new chancellor says | url= http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_7044109 | publisher= [[Mercury News]] | date= September 30, 2007 | accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mills | first=Kay | title=Changes at "Oxford on the Pacific," UC Santa Cruz turns to engineering and technology | url=http://www.highereducation.org/crosstalk/ct0401/news0401-changesoxfordpacific.shtml | journal=National Crosstalk | publisher=National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | volume=9 | date=Spring 2001 | accessdate=January 28, 2008 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, UC Santa Cruz opened its new $35 million Digital Arts Research Center; a project in planning since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14986867?nclick_check=1| title = UCSC cuts ribbon on $35 million digital arts building| author = Megha Satyanarayana| date = April 29, 2010| accessdate =May 3, 2010| publisher = San Jose Mercury News

The $72 million Coastal Biology Building officially opened on 21 October 2017 on the Coastal Science Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz to dedicate new Coastal Biology building on October 21|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/coastal-biology-building.html|website=UC Santa Cruz News|accessdate=October 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus houses the Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department and faculty interested in the study of ocean, terrestrial and freshwater environments, marine sciences, ecology and evolution, and plant sciences.  UC Santa Cruz is extending its environmental leadership in coastal science with a robust new program that will welcome its first cohort of students in Fall 2018. The Graduate Program in Coastal Science and Policy will train advocates and develop government and community responses to pressing sustainability issues.

==Campus==
[[File:UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz Aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz aerial view. The Great Meadow is the undeveloped area between city and university]]
The {{convert|2000|acre|ha|adj=on}} UCSC campus is located {{convert|75|mi|km}} south of San Francisco, in the Ben Lomond Mountain ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Elevation varies from {{convert|285|ft|m}} at the campus entrance to {{convert|1195|ft|m}} at the northern boundary, a difference of about {{convert|900|ft|m}}. The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open [[meadow]], locally known as the Great Meadow. To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] groves. The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Harvey West Park |url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/harvey.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pogonip (park)|Pogonip open space preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Pogonip|url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/pogo.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the north by [[Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Cowell Redwoods SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=546|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the town of [[Felton, California|Felton]], and on the west by [[Gray Whale Ranch]], a portion of [[Wilder Ranch State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilder Ranch SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=549|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The campus is built on a portion of the [[Cowell Lime Works|Cowell Family ranch]], which was purchased by the University of California in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=11341|title=The original City on a Hill|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 5, 2008|last=Redfern|first=Cathy|date=September 2, 2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails. The heavily forested area has allowed UC Santa Cruz to operate a [[RV park|recreational vehicle park]] as a form of student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UC Santa Cruz – University Family Student Housing| url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| accessdate=October 27, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026004728/http://housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| archive-date=October 26, 2006| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[shrines]], dens and other student-built curiosities are scattered around the northern campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the university razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|title='An Unnatural History of UCSC' traces the evolution of a magical campus setting – Santa Cruz Sentinel|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|date=April 13, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2008|last=Baine|first=Wallace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413062824/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|archive-date=April 13, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173AF931A25752C0A964958260

Creeks traverse the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCSC Walking Map | url=http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901143913/http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flickr: Oaks Path Night | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/exitfromreality/55520898/ |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of natural points of interest throughout the UCSC grounds. The "Porter Caves" are a popular site among students on the west side of campus. The entrance is located in the forest between the [[Porter College]] meadow and Empire Grade Road. The caves wind through a set of caverns, some of which are challenging, narrow passages. Tree Nine is another popular destination for students. A large [[Douglas fir]] spanning approximately {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, Tree Nine is located in the upper campus of UCSC behind [[College Nine]]. The tree had been a popular climbing spot for many years but due to environmental corrosion and fear of student injuries, UC ground services sawed off the limbs to make it nearly impossible to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Tovin Lapan, [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 "UCSC attempts to stop students from climbing campus favorite 'Tree Nine' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520114146/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 |date=May 20, 2013 }} ' 'Santa Cruz Sentinel' ' , October 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For specific directions, reference: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100111072232/http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Tree-Nine-at-the-University-of-California-in-Santa-Cruz directions to Tree Nine] For the less experienced tree-climber, students also frequent Sunset Tree located on the east side of the meadow behind the UCSC Music Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|title=UCSC Campus Field Trip|date=April 17, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417170443/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|archivedate=April 17, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|title=Empire Cave|date=April 20, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420140510/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|archivedate=April 20, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university offers 63 undergraduate majors and 35 minors, with graduate programs in 33 fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz – Academic Programs|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/academics/
|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary programs, such as Computational Media, Feminist Studies, [[Environmental studies|Environmental Studies]], Visual Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, and the prestigious [[History of Consciousness]] Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.

A joint program with [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|UC Hastings]] enables UC Santa Cruz students to earn a bachelor's degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven.  The "3+3 BA/JD" Program between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco accepted its first applicants in fall 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/|title=3 Plus 3|website=3plus3.ucsc.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UCSC students who declare their intent in their freshman or early sophomore year will complete three years at UCSC and then move on to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum. Credits from the first year of law school will count toward a student's bachelor's degree. Students who successfully complete the first-year law course work will receive their bachelor's degree and be able to graduate with their UCSC class, then continue at UC Hastings afterwards for two years.

===Research===
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], UC Santa Cruz spent $155.5 million on research and development in 2012, ranking it 120th in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site;jsessionid=519A925E61C6701A1CAB3D9DDC0EE0B8?method=rankingBySource&amp;ds=herd |title=Rankings by total R&amp;D expenditures |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level [[natural science]] research component with the appointment of plant physiologist [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] as the first provost of [[Crown College, University of California, Santa Cruz|Crown College]]. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714160609/http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2006|title=Kenneth V.

In 2016 it was ranked 83rd in the world by the ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' and 296th worldwide in 2016 by the ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.

In 2009, RePEc, an online database of research economics articles, ranked the UCSC Economics Department sixth in the world in the field of international finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economics web site ranks UCSC sixth in the world for research on international finance|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|accessdate=November 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528041409/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|archivedate=May 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''High Times'' magazine placed UCSC as first among US universities as a "counterculture college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked 1st in High Times 2007|url=http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|accessdate=October 14, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920125855/http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|archivedate=September 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' (with ''[[Gamepro]]'' magazine) ranked UC Santa Cruz's Game Design major among the top 50 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked in top 50 for Game Design |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/game-design.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''The Princeton Review'' and ''Gamepro Media'' ranked UC Santa Cruz's graduate programs in Game Design as seventh in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Graduate Schools for Video Game Design 2011|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, UCSC was ranked No. 3 in the Most Beautiful Campus list of ''Princeton Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Franek, Robert. The Best 376 Colleges, 2012 Edition. The Princeton Review. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residential colleges==
The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the university's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the "[[residential college|residential college system]]" outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see [[University of California, Santa Cruz#History|History]], above). Upon admission, all undergraduate students have the opportunity to choose one of ten colleges, with which they usually stay affiliated for their entire undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name="collegesection"&gt;
{{cite web|title=UCSC General Catalog 2004–2006 (The Colleges section)|accessdate=June 29, 2006|url=http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/html/04_06colleges.htm
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060627051850/http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/html/04_06colleges.htm |archivedate = June 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are cases where some students switch college affiliations as each college holds a different graduation ceremony. Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Other universities with similar college systems include [[Rice University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty [[provost (education)|provost]], who is the nominal head of his or her college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; An incoming first-year student will take a mandatory "core course" within his or her respective college, with a curriculum and central theme unique to that college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments. Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges. The ten colleges are, in order of establishment:

===Grading===
For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique [[Grading in the United States|student evaluation]] system. With the exception of the choice of letter grades in science courses the only [[grade (education)|grades]] assigned were "pass" and "no record", supplemented with [[narrative evaluation]]s. Beginning in 1997, UCSC allowed students the option of selecting letter grade evaluations, but course grades were still optional until 2000, when faculty voted to require students receive letter grades. Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades. {{As of|2010}}, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure. Still, some professors write evaluations for all students while some would write evaluations for specific students upon request.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/02/24/MN88561.DTL|title=UC Santa Cruz To Start Using Letter Grades|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 2, 2008|last=Schevitz|first=Tanya|date=February 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can still elect to receive a "pass/no pass" grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading. A grade of C and above would receive a grade of "pass". Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a "pass/no pass" basis. Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now "graded", most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC Discover – Academics

==Library==
[[File:McHenry Library stacks, University of California Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|McHenry Library stacks]]
The [[McHenry Library]] houses UCSC's arts and letters collection, with most of the scientific reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library. The McHenry Library was designed by [[John Carl Warnecke]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In addition, the colleges host smaller libraries, which serve as quiet places to study.  The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the papers of [[Anaïs Nin]], the papers and drawings of [[Beat poet]] [[Kenneth Patchen]], the largest collection of [[Edward Weston]] photographs in the country, the [[mycology]] book collection of composer [[John Cage]], a large collection of works by [[Satyajit Ray]], the [[Hayden White]] collection of 16th-century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive. The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to [[Lick Observatory]] dating back to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

UC Santa Cruz is also well known for its [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2,000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual "[[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]". Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark pot holiday

The 2007 event attracted a total of 5,000 participants. The university does not condone the gathering, but has taken steps to regulate the event and ensure security for all participants. On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the number of buses that could drive through campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UCSC takes security measures for '4/20|date=April 18, 2008|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|last=Brown|first=J.M.|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|accessdate=April 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091023/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|archive-date=November 20, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|title=Police: Pot-smoking event in UCSC meadow 'a moral slap in the face|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=April 23, 2008|date=April 22, 2008|last=Ragan|first=Tom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208215646/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|archive-date=February 8, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well known tradition is what is known as "[[First Rain]]". Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain. The run begins at Porter and proceeds to travel through all the other colleges, collecting more students in its train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cityonahillpress.com/2006/10/12/a-naked-run-through-campus/

===Housing===
Most of the UCSC undergraduate housing is affiliated with one of the ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, [[gender-neutral housing|gender-neutral]] and substance-free floors are also available.

All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.

In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services | url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | accessdate=April 16, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404191759/http://housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | archive-date=April 4, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
UCSC is home to few fraternities and sororities. The first Greek organization on campus, [[Theta Chi]], was given colony status on January 10, 1987 and chartered on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like [[Theta Chi]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student groups like P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxucsc.com/history.html|title=Wayback Machine|date=August 31, 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831231223/http://oxucsc.com/history.html|archivedate=August 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek life at UCSC includes fraternities [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Phi Zeta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Pi Alpha Phi]], and [[Delta Lambda Psi]], the nation's first gender neutral queer Greek organization. Sororities that are members of the [[National Panhellenic Council]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz include [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]. Recently in June 2016 the Theta Xi chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] was chartered to bring a third National sorority to UC Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kappaalphatheta.org/whatsnew/index.cfm?entryId=86CC0556-DDF7-2DE8-A1591D25B14DFC64|title=Kappa Alpha Theta - What's New - Kappa Alpha Theta Welcomes UC Santa Cruz!|website=Kappaalphatheta.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sororities on campus include [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Pi Alpha]], [[Tri Chi]], [[Sigma Omicron Pi]], [[Kappa Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]] and [[Alpha Psi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/studentorgs/rso-glo/glolist.html|title=List of Greek Organizations|website=soar.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent Greek lettered organization added to the campus was [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority, which chartered its chapter Gamma Phi as of Spring 2016.

Aside from social fraternities and sororities on campus, there are also a number of professional organizations as well. There are [[Kappa Gamma Delta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgdatucsc.org|title=Kappa Gamma Delta- UC Santa Cruz, Zeta Chapter|website=KGD|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prehealth sorority, [[Sigma Mu Delta]], a prehealth fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a coed service fraternity, [[Phi Alpha Delta]], a pre-law fraternity, and [[Delta Sigma Pi]], a co-ed professional business fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|title=UCSC Discover - Student Life|date=May 31, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531010536/https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|archivedate=May 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Though UCSC has been known for its conservation efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sustainability Office|url=http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|work=Sustainability Office|publisher=UCSC Sustainability Office|accessdate=May 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060403/http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.

==Athletics==
{{main|UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs}}
[[File:UCSC East Field.jpg|thumb|East Field]]
UCSC competes in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as an Independent member. There are fifteen [[varsity team|varsity]] sports – men's and women's basketball, tennis, soccer, volleyball, swimming, cross country and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and women's golf. UCSC teams have been Division III nationally ranked in tennis, soccer, men's volleyball, and swimming. The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of successful club teams. It has won multiple club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.

In 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.
