The '''45th [[Pacific Islands Forum]]''' was held from 29 July to 1 August 2014 in [[Palau]].&lt;ref name="Radio Australia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2014-07-28/pacific-leaders-to-discuss-climate-change-sustainable-fishing-during-pacific-islands-forum-in-palau/1348872 | title=Pacific leaders to discuss climate change, sustainable fishing during Pacific Islands Forum in Palau | publisher=Radio Australia | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum's official opening was held in the capital [[Ngerulmud]], in [[Melekeok|Melekeok State]], but the majority of events were held in [[Koror]], Palau's largest city and former capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaupif.com/annex.html Calendar of Events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121121157/http://www.palaupif.com/annex.html |date=21 January 2015 }} –  Palau PIF. Retrieved 21 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The official theme of the meeting was "The Ocean: Life &amp; Future". Topics under discussion include [[climate change]], commercial fishing, non-communicable diseases and the possibility of readmitting [[Fiji]] to the forum.

== Overview ==
The Pacific Islands Forum is an [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] organization that aims to enhance cooperation between the independent countries of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was founded in 1971 as the South Pacific Forum. In 1999, the name was changed; Pacific Islands Forum is more inclusive of the Forum's [[Oceania]]-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific [[island country|island countries]] and [[Australia]]. It is an official observer at the [[United Nations]].

The mission of Pacific Islands Forum is “to work in support of Forum member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum members in ways agreed by the Forum”. Its decisions are implemented by the ''[[Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat]]'' (PIFS), which grew out of the ''South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation'' (SPEC). As well as its role in harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent Chairman of the [[Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific]] (CROP).&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/about-us/ | title=About Us | publisher=Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | accessdate=29 July 2014 | last=Unattributed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
[[President of Palau]] [[Tommy Remengesau]] declared the official theme of the Forum would be "The Ocean: Life &amp; Future",&lt;ref name="Global Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/873131.shtml | title=Pacific Islands Forum to open in Palau | publisher=Global Times | work=Xinhua News Agency | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the major focus on the issue of climate change amidst concern over rising sea levels and sinking islands in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.msn.com/world/pacific-summit-to-urge-action-on-climate-change | title=Pacific summit to urge action on climate change | publisher=MSN | work=AFP | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the solution to the problem of rising seas as well as ocean warming and acidification is the reduction of CO2 emissions.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-concerns-aired-pacific-summit-opens-155515666.html | title=Climate concerns aired as Pacific summit opens | publisher=Yahoo! | work=AFP | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific islands leaders plan to produce a follow-up to the [[Majuro Declaration]], which was passed at the 44th Pacific Islands Forum with the support of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; [[Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat]] [[Tuiloma Neroni Slade]] commended Remengesau for the choice of theme, noting "it is a theme that is most timely with considerable strategic significance in the lead up to the 3rd UN conference on Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) to be held in [[Samoa]], in September."&lt;ref name="Global Times" /&gt;

Other topics on the agenda for the Forum include commercial fishing and non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; Earlier this year, President Remengesau proposed a ban on commercial fishing in Palau. Bans and other ways to promote marine conservation will be discussed at the Forum.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; Leaders are upset that despite the lucrative nature of the Pacific tuna fishing industry, worth approximately four billion US dollars per year, it is poorly managed and little of the money trickles back to Pacific countries.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt; Prevalence of smoking and obesity are widespread in the Pacific, and leaders in Palau want to discuss ways to reduce these problems at the Forum. To model good practices, smoking has been banned during the course of the event, and dietary guidelines have been put in place for food served at all meetings during the event.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt;

The readmission of [[Fiji]] to the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] was also discussed at the Forum. Fiji was [[Pacific Islands Forum#Suspension of Fiji|banned]] in 2009 after the military government that took power in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]] promised elections in 2009 but failed to hold them.&lt;ref name="ABC Australia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-29/pacific-islands-forum-gets-underway-in-palau/5633780 | title=Leaders gather in Palau for Pacific Islands Forum | publisher=Australia Network News | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014 | author=Schwartz, Dominque}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, readmission is unlikely to occur before the [[Fijian general election, 2014|Fijian election]] in September.&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt; [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[John Key]] said he would discuss allowing Fiji to return to the Forum, but [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Fiji)|Foreign Minister of Fiji]] [[Ratu]] [[Inoke Kubuabola]] previously stated that Fiji would not consider reapplying unless Australia and New Zealand were banned from the forum.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt;

== Representatives ==
In addition to representatives from each of the 15 participating countries, representatives of major powers such as the [[United States]], [[China]], [[India]], and the [[European Union]] also attended the forum.&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thejetnewspaper.com/2014/07/29/eu-high-representative-to-attend-pacific-islands-forum-in-palau/ | title=EU High Representative to Attend Pacific Islands Forum in Palau | publisher=The Jet | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and current [[Counselor to the President]] [[John Podesta]] led the US delegation at the forum, a group including senior officials from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], [[United States Pacific Command]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Interior]], [[Peace Corps]], [[United States Agency for International Development]], and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="RTCC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rtcc.org/2014/07/29/podesta-heads-to-pacific-climate-meet-nz-and-aus-pms-decline/ | title=Podesta heads to Pacific climate meet, NZ and Aus PMs decline | publisher=Responding to Climate Change | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014 | author=Yeo, Sophie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation of the European Union was led by [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] for the EU and [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] [[Catherine Ashton]].&lt;ref name="The Jet" /&gt; Ashton will speak at a plenary session on 30 July and host a dinner that same evening. Her goals are to discuss issues of mutual interest such as climate change and increase strategic relations between the EU and Pacific islands. The EU has already agreed to provide over 750 million Euros for bilateral and regional cooperation.&lt;ref name="The Jet" /&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Tony Abbott]] and [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[John Key]], heads of government of the two largest participating countries in the Forum, were both unable to attend.&lt;ref name="RTCC" /&gt; Tony Abbott was occupied with matters concerning the crash of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]. The Australian delegation was led by [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Warren Truss]] and [[Parliamentary Secretary#Australia|Parliamentary Secretary]] [[Brett Mason]].&lt;ref name="ABC Australia" /&gt; 
The New Zealand delegation was led by Foreign Minister [[Murray McCully]], who promised a $5 million programme to update navigation maps for the region, and to help protect Pacific fisheries.

The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] condemned Key for not attending the forum, and accused both leaders of not caring deeply enough about the effects of climate change.&lt;ref name="RTCC" /&gt;

Nitrogen, acting as an oxidant, is therefore reduced in a succession of four reactions performed by the enzymes [[Nitrate reductase|nitrate]], [[Nitrite reductase|nitrite]], [[Nitric-oxide reductase|nitric-oxide]], and [[Nitrous-oxide reductase|nitrous oxide]] reductases.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  The pathway ultimately yields reduced molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as, when the reaction does not reach completion, the intermediate species [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  A simple [[denitrification]] reaction proceeds as:

:{{chem|NO|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO →  {{chem|N|2|O}} → {{chem|N|2}} (g)

The [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reaction which utilizes oxygen as the oxidant is:

:{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} (aq) + 6{{chem|O|2}} (g) → 6{{chem|CO|2}} (g) + 6{{chem|H|2|O|}}

Classically, it was thought that denitrification would not occur in the presence of oxygen since there seems to be no energetic advantage to using nitrate as an oxidant when oxygen is available.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  Experiments have since proven that denitrifiers are often [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=William H.|year=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-625155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aerobic denitrification does indeed occur in a broad range of [[Denitrifying bacteria|microbial organisms]] with varying levels of productivity, usually lower productivity than results from purely aerobic respiration.  The advantages of being able to perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen are uncertain, though it is possible that the ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels plays a role.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt; Aerobic denitrification may be found in environments where fluctuating oxygen concentrations and reduced carbon are available&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relative harsh environment inspires the potential of denitrifiers to degrade toxic nitrate or nitrate under an aerobic atmosphere. Aerobic denitrifiers tend to work efficiently at 25 ~ 37°C and pH 7 ~ 8, when dissolved oxygen concentration is 3 ~ 5 mg/L and C/N load ratio is 5 ~ 10&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

==Environmental impact==

=== Wastewater treatment ===
Water treatment often relies on the activity of [[Denitrification|anaerobically denitrifying bacteria]] in order to remove [[nitrate]] from water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lv|first=Pengyi|last2=Luo|first2=Jinxue|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xuliang|last4=Zhang|first4=Dongqing|last5=Huang|first5=Zhanbin|last6=Bai|first6=Zhihui|date=2017-08-30|title=Diversity of culturable aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the sediment, water and biofilms in Liangshui River of Beijing, China|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09556-9|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09556-9|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of oxygen, nitrate cannot be fully reduced to [[dinitrogen]], thus nitrate remains in the water or it is converted to nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lingering nitrate in drinking water poses a plethora of health risks, and both nitrate and nitrous oxide have major environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Alyce M.|last2=Diaz|first2=James H.|last3=Kaye|first3=Alan David|date=2014|title=Reexamining the Risks of Drinking-Water Nitrates on Public Health|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=392–398|issn=1524-5012|pmc=4171798|pmid=25249806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Emma L.|last2=Allison|first2=Steven D.|date=2012-07-31|title=Meta-Analysis of Environmental Impacts on Nitrous Oxide Release in Response to N Amendment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00272|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3408851|pmid=22866053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hazards include, [[carcinogen]]ic nitrate ions in drinking water, or [[eutrophication]] caused by oxidized nitrogen seeding [[Algal bloom]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=David|date=1993-10-01|title=Aerobic denitrification in soils and sediments: From fallacies to factx|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016953479390218E|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=8|issue=10|pages=352–356|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90218-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely aerobic denitrification can further reduce oxidized nitrogen in a less specialized environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, many aerobically denitrifying bacteria from the [[pseudomonas]] genus (''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri|Pm. stutzeri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas mendocina|Pm. mendocina]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas putida|Pm. Putida]])'' were shown to be isolated from the [[Lingshui River|Liangshui river]] in China, and could be further used in [[bioaugmentation]] to clear contaminated water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Pseudomas,  ''[[Acinetobacter]] sp.'' SYF26 was isolated from the [[Heihe|Hei He]] reservoir in [[China]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su|first=Jun-feng|last2=Zhang|first2=Kai|last3=Huang|first3=Ting-lin|last4=Wen|first4=Gang|last5=Guo|first5=Lin|last6=Yang|first6=Shao-fei|date=2015|title=Heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification at low nutrient conditions by a newly isolated bacterium, Acinetobacter sp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9800">The term '''Bible fiction''' refers to works of [[fiction]] which use characters, settings and events taken from the [[Bible]]. The degree of fictionalization in these works varies and, although they are often written by [[Christian]]s or [[Jew]]s, this is not always the case.

Originally, these novels were consistent with true belief in the historicity of the Bible's narrative, replete with miracles, and God's explicit presence.  Some of these works have been important and influential, and eventually there have appeared heterodox Bible novels that reflect [[modernism|modern]], [[postmodern]] or [[realism (arts)|realist]] influences and themes.

An early Bible novel that may still be the most influential is ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' by [[Lew Wallace]], and published by Harper &amp; Brothers on November 12, 1880.  It remained the best-selling American novel of all time, surpassing [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) in sales and remaining at the top of the US all-time bestseller list until the publication of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1936). ''Ben-Hur'' is a [[bildungsroman]] and adventure novel that follows the tumultuous life of its protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur. He is a fictional Jewish noble from Jerusalem who suffers betrayal (by a boyhood friend) and consequently his enslavement and his family's imprisonment by the Romans.  Concurrent with Judah's narrative is the developing Christian story, as Jesus and Judah are natives of the same region and about the same age. Judah survives his ordeal and becomes a famous soldier and charioteer, enabling him to avenge his misfortune.  Judah's encounters with Jesus first during Judah's and then during Jesus' suffering lead to the Messiah's curing of Judah's sister and mother of leprosy and Judah's conversion to Christianity. There have been numerous film adaptations including the 1959 version starring [[Charlton Heston]] that won ten academy awards.

''[[The Robe]]'' (1942) by [[Lloyd C. Douglas]] was one of the best-selling novels of the 1940s and dramatizes the crucifixion of Jesus from the point of view of Marcellus Gallio, the Roman tribune who commands the garrison that carries out the crucifixion of Jesus. Marcellus winds up in custody of Jesus' robe and converts to Christianity because of his experiences interacting with the robe's magical powers.  Like ''Ben-Hur'', ''The Robe'' was in 1953 adapted into an Academy Award winning film.

In the twentieth century, there began to appear heterodox Bible fiction.  [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1960), caused a widespread outcry and appeared on many banned book lists for its dramatization of Jesus as wracked by temptations, beset by fear, doubts, depression, reluctance and lust.  However, Jesus is nevertheless portrayed as a miracle-worker and the son of God who is resurrected following the crucifixion.  [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Gospel According to the Son]]'' (1997) is a retelling in Mailer's own words that adheres closely to the Gospel narrative including miracles and resurrection.  This was noteworthy in part because Mailer was a Jew, not a Christian.

[[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ]]'' (2010) is a heavily allegorical retelling of the Christian story that uses postmodern techniques and is an evident polemic against Christianity.  It retells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, brothers, "Jesus" and "Christ," with contrasting personalities:  Jesus is a moral and spiritual man, and his brother Christ is an ambitious character who wishes to hijack Jesus' biography and legacy to develop a myth that will be the foundation for a powerful and worldly Church.

Other works are regarded as heterodox simply because they dramatize the Bible stories realistically, shorn of mythical, miraculous or magical elements.  They may even include the transformation from real life events to mythology as part of the narrative.  Realist Bible novels are typically semi-historical in that they develop the setting in Israel or Egypt or Rome or as the case may be—including the political and class and racial conflicts and urban and rural landscape imagery—with fidelity to known historical facts. As [[Robert Graves]] said of his novel ''[[King Jesus]]'' (1946), "I undertake to my readers that every important element in my story is based on some tradition, however tenuous, and that I have taken more than ordinary pains to verify my historical background."

Realist Bible novels employ in some way the narratives that comprise the canonical Biblical narrative, but shorn of miracles, or God's explicit presence.  With respect to Jesus' biography, Jesus is portrayed as a man, usually a rebel against the wealthy classes (sometimes he himself is born into a privileged background and rebels against his own class), and the ruling Romans and their local client autocrats.   Sometimes Jesus' biography is enhanced by sources external to the canonical gospels such as Josephus' chronicles, the Talmud, or non-canonical gospels, and the author's imagination.

Graves' ''King Jesus'' develops the protagonist as, not the son of God, but rather as a philosopher with a legitimate claim to be the earthly king of the Jews as a descendant of Herod the Great, and the Old Testament's David.  The novel has heterodox retellings of Biblical stories.

''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (1943) is a novel by [[Thomas Mann]] that retells the familiar stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph, setting it in the historical context of the Amarna Period. Mann considered it his greatest work.

''[[The Red Tent (Anita Diamant novel)|The Red Tent]]'' (1997) a novel by [[Anita Diamant]], is a first-person narrative that tells the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph.  Diamont has broadened her character from her minor and brief role in the Bible.  The book's title refers to the tent in which women of Jacob's tribe must, as dictated by ancient law, be quarantined while menstruating or giving birth. There the women find mutual support and encouragement from their mothers, sisters and aunts.

[[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]]' ''[[The Secret Chord]]'' (2015) is narrated by Natan, the prophet who communicates God's directives to David.  The scriptures are her primary sources for the plot, which includes all the well-known key events: Goliath, David's facility with the harp, kingdom building, Bathsheba, and so on.  There are other characters fully developed from Brooks' imagination and portrayed through Natan's point of view.

''[[The Testament of Mary]]'' (2012) a novella by [[Colm Toibin]], is a retelling of the Christian story from the point of view of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, she does not believe Jesus is the Son of God – she knows he is a man – and she is contemptuous of the Gospel writers who visit her to solicit her cooperation and give her food and shelter. The themes or questions that the novel explores are narrative truth and fiction, feminism, loss, identity and corruption thereof, invasion of privacy, and worldly ambition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/the-testament-of-mary-by-colm-toibin.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Testament of Mary'' was adapted into a Broadway play.

''The Liars' Gospel'' (2012), by Jewish author [[Naomi Alderman]], retells the Christ story from a Jewish perspective.  Four witnesses to the key events, Mary, Judas, Caiaphas and Barabbas, are the narrators in four sections of the novel, and the story spans the period from Pompey's siege of Jerusalem in 63 BC through Titus's siege in 70 AD.

''John the Baptizer'' (2009), by Brooks Hansen and published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], is a novelized life of John the Baptist that dramatizes the man beneath the hagiography. According to Christian theology, John was merely a forerunner to Christ, but Hansen's portrait is strongly influenced by the Gnostic teachings that reveal John as a messianic figure at the center of a sect called the Mandeans, and more mature, rigorous and restrained than his younger and charismatic protégé Jesus.

''Logos'' (2015), a novel by John Neeleman and published by Homebound Publications, a [[small press]], and winner of an [[Independent Publisher Book Awards]] gold medal for religious fiction and the Utah Book Award for fiction,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utahhumanities.org/index.php/Center-for-the-Book/utah-book-award.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a bildungsroman that follows the life and development of the anonymous author of the original gospel.  Jacob, a former temple priest in Jerusalem who has been rendered bereft by the Jewish wars and consequent destruction of his family and culture, is inspired by his own autobiography and Paul's mythmaking to create the canonical gospels' original narrative.

''The Gospel According to Lazarus'' (2019), a novel by [[Richard Zimler]], expands upon the story of [[Lazarus of Bethany]], who was raised from the dead in the [[Gospel of John]]. According to Zimler, one of the objectives of his novel was to return to the New Testament figures their [[Judaism]], so in his narrative, Jesus is called Yeshua ben Yosef and Lazarus is called Eliezer ben Natan. Yeshua and Eliezer have been best friends from childhood, and Yeshua is characterized as a [[Merkabah]] mystic.  The themes of the book include how we cope with a loss of faith, the terrible sacrifices we make for those we love, the transcendent meaning of Yeshua's mission, and how we go on after suffering a shattering trauma.

'''Charles Alexander Jencks''' (born June 21, 1939) is a cultural theorist, landscape designer, architectural historian, and co-founder of the [[Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres]]. He has published over thirty books and became famous in the 1980s as theorist of [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news |last= Hawcock |first= Neville|date= June 26, 2015|title= The Crawick Multiverse: sandpit becomes land art|newspaper= Financial Times |url= https://www.ft.com/content/9eeb3b26-1a63-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996 |access-date= 6 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years Jencks has devoted time to landform architecture, especially in Scotland.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; These landscapes include the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'' and earthworks at [[Jupiter Artland]] outside Edinburgh. His continuing project ''[[Crawick Multiverse]]'', commissioned by the Duke of Buccleuch, opened in 2015 near [[Sanquhar]].

==Early years and family life==

Born in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland,]] on June 21, 1939, Charles Alexander Jencks was the son of composer [[Gardner Platt Jencks]] and [[Ruth DeWitt Pearl]]. Jencks attended Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature at [[Harvard University]] in 1961 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in architecture from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] in 1965. In 1965 Jencks moved to the [[United Kingdom]] where he now has houses in Scotland and London. In 1970 Jencks received a PhD in architectural history, studying under the radical modernist [[Reyner Banham]] at [[University College, London]]. This thesis was the source for his ''Modern Movements in Architecture'' (1973) which criticised the suppression of some Modernist variations.

Jencks has two sons by his first marriage: one works as a landscape architect in Shanghai, while the other works for Jardines in Vietnam. He has two children by Maggie Keswick: John Jencks, a London-based filmmaker, married to Amy Agnew, and Lily Clare Jencks, who in 2014 wed Roger Keeling.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jackie. 'Dumfries Big Bang Theory Solved', Daily Record. Aug 26 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Jencks married Louisa Lane Fox as his third wife in 2006, and is thus the stepfather of her son Henry Lane Fox and daughter [[Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho|Martha Lane Fox]].

==Architectural design==

Jencks' first architectural design was a studio in the woods, a cheap mass-produced garage structure of $5,000 – titled ''The Garagia Rotunda'', where he spent part of the summers with his family. The ad hoc use of readymade materials was championed in his polemical text with Nathan Silver ''Adhocism – the Case for Improvisation'' in 1971 and 2013. Jencks' architectural designs experimented with ideas from [[Complex systems|complexity theory]].

His London house was designed with Maggie Keswick and [[Postmodern]] architects including [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and [[Michael Graves]].

==Maggie's Centres==

After his second wife Maggie Keswick Jencks  died in 1995, Jencks helped co-found and [[Maggie's Centres|Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres]].  Based on the notion of self-help and the fact that cancer patients are often involved in a long, drawn-out struggle, the Centres provide social and psychological help in an attractive setting next to large hospitals.  Their architecture, landscape, and art are designed to support both patients and caregivers and to give dignity to those who, in the past, often hid their disease. Maggie Keswick Jencks is the author of the book ''The Chinese Garden'', on which her husband also worked.

==Landscape architecture and landforms==
[[File:Blackhole6.JPG|thumb|''Black Hole'' in the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'']]
Jencks switched to landscape design as a site for symbolic exploration when Maggie asked Charles to design in the family home and garden in Scotland. The result in 2003 was the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'', a series of twenty areas designed around various metaphors such as the DNA garden, Quark Walk, Fractal terrace and Comet Bridge. Further hybrid landforms and symbolic sculptures were built in Edinburgh, Milan, Long Island, Cambridge, Suncheon South Korea (with Lily Jencks), and other countries, some of which was published in ''The Universe in The Landscape'', 2011.

From 2010, Jencks started work on the ''[[Crawick Multiverse]]'', a fifty-five acre site in southwest Scotland. This project developed for Richard Buccleuch,  opened in 2015.

[[File:CellsofLife CharlesJencks 2005 Photo AllanPollokMorris CourtesyJupiterArtland 12.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|''Cells of Life'', a landform at [[Jupiter Artland]]]]
The ''Metaphysical Landscape'', was an exhibition of sculpture at [[Jupiter Artland]], 2011. Jencks later exhibited at the Merz Gallery, Sanquhar 2016.

The ''Garden of Cosmic Speculation'', designed in part by Jencks and begun in 1988, was dedicated to Jencks' late wife Maggie Keswick Jencks. Jencks, his wife, scientists, and their friends designed the garden based on natural and scientific processes.  Jencks' goal was to celebrate nature, but he also incorporated elements from the modern sciences into the design.  The garden contains species of plants that are pleasurable to the eye, as well as edible. Preserving paths and the traditional beauty of the garden is still his concern, but Jencks enhances the cosmic landscape using new tools and artificial materials.  Just as [[Zen garden|Japanese Zen gardens]], [[Paradise garden|Persian paradise gardens]], and the English and [[Gardens of the French Renaissance|French Renaissance gardens]] were analogies for the universe, the design represents the cosmic and cultural evolution of the contemporary world. The garden is a microcosm – as one walks through the gardens they experience the universe in miniature. According to Jencks, gardens are also autobiographical because they reveal the happiest moments, the tragedies, and the truths of the owner and family.

As the garden developed, so too did such sciences as cosmology, and this allowed a dynamic interaction between the unfolding universe, an unfolding science, and a questioning design. Jencks believes that contemporary science is potentially a great moving force for creativity, because it tells us the truth about the way the universe is and shows us the patterns of beauty.  As explained in his book ''The Universe in the Landscape'' (2011), his work is content-driven. His many landforms are based on the idea that landforming is a radical hybrid activity combining gardens, landscape, urbanism, architecture, sculpture, and epigraphy. Thus, the landforms often include enigmatic writing and complex symbolism. They provoke the visitor to interpret landscape on the largest and smallest scale.

[[File:Crawick Multiverse stone rows.JPG|thumb|Stone rows on the 'North-South Line' at the ''[[Crawick Multiverse]]'']]
Jencks has become a leading figure in British [[landscape architecture]]. His landscape work is inspired by [[black hole]]s, [[fractal]]s, genetics, [[chaos theory]], waves and [[soliton]]s. In Edinburgh, Scotland, he designed the landform at the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] in collaboration with [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and Duncan Whatmore of [[Terry Farrell and Partners]]. Other works include the ''Garden of Cosmic Speculation'' at Portrack House near [[Dumfries]]; Designs for Black Hole Landscape, IUCAA, Pune, India, 2002;  Portello Park, Milan 2002–2007 (Time Garden 2004–2007); Two Cells – Inverness Maggie's Centre, 2003–2005; [[Northumberlandia]] Landform, 2004; Cells of Life, Jupiter Artland, Bonnington House 2003–2010; ''Crawick Multiverse'', 2006– ;  Memories of the Future landform and reclamation project, Altdobern, Germany; Wu Chi, Black Hole Oval Terrace, Beijing Olympic Park, 2008; and The Scottish World, St. Ninians, Kelty, 2003, 2010+.

He is also a furniture designer and sculptor, completing DNA sculptures at [[Kew Gardens]] in 2003 and Cambridge University in 2005.

==Architectural writing==
Jencks discussed his theories of [[postmodern architecture]] in ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'' (1977), which ran to seven editions. He examined the paradigm shift from modern to postmodern architecture, claiming that modern architecture concentrates on univalent forms such as right angles and square buildings often resembling office buildings. However, postmodern architecture focuses on forms derived from the mind, body, city context, and nature. In 2007, he published ‘''Critical Modernism'',’ the fifth edition of his ''What is Post-Modernism?''

In ''Meaning in Architecture'', 1969, co-edited with George Baird, a hypertext of leading architects and theorists commenting on each other’s texts, Jencks addressed issues of who is the ultimate user of architecture, what values should be crystallised in architecture, and what  public architecture should represent. This was followed by other anthologies on [[semiotics]].

His book ''The Iconic Building'' explored trend setting and celebrity culture. He claimed that the reason that modern culture seeks the "iconic building" is because it has the possibility of reversing the economic trend of a flagging "[[conurbation]]". An iconic building is created to make a splash, to generate money, and the normal criteria of valuation do not apply. He wrote that “enigmatic signifiers” can be used in an effective way to support the deeper meaning of the building.

His book ''Critical Modernism - Where is Post-Modernism Going?'' came out in 2007. It is an overview of postmodernism in which Jencks argues that postmodernism is a critical reaction to [[modernism]] that comes from within modernism itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470030100.html Wiley, Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Modernism-Where-Post-Modernism-Going/dp/0470030119 Amazon Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?video11494 TVO, Big Ideas Talk: Charles Jencks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609234527/http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?video11494 |date=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2007, the [[Royal Academy]] hosted a debate between Jencks and [[John N. Gray]] centered around the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/events/focusdays/ra-forum-debate-with-charles-jencks-critical-modernism,193,EV.html|title=RA Forum Debate with Charles Jencks: Critical Modernism|accessdate=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126002627/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/events/focusdays/ra-forum-debate-with-charles-jencks-critical-modernism%2C193%2CEV.html|archivedate=January 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Connections''''' is a 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary]] television series and 1978 book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]. The series was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] of the [[BBC]] Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the [[history of science]] and [[invention]], and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and [[deadpan|dry humour]]), [[historical re-enactment]]s, and intricate working [[scale model|models]].

The popular success of the series led to the production of ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997), both for [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. In 2004, [[KPJK|KCSM-TV]] produced a program called ''Re-Connections'', consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content==
[[File:Pike Square.JPG|thumb|Modern soldiers demonstrate the use of steel-tipped [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] against [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] in one of the many re-enactments used in ''Connections''.]]
''Connections'' explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and [[teleology|teleological]] view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

To demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[middle ages|medieval times]]) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode "The Long Chain" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the [[fluyt]], a type of Dutch [[cargo ship]].

Burke also explores three [[corollary|corollaries]] to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, [[Future shock|becomes too much for the average person]] to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

Lastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] or the funding of controversial projects such as [[stem cell]] research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?

&lt;/ref&gt;  The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions.  Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes.  It can be found in many libraries.

# "The Trigger Effect" details the world's present dependence on complex technological networks through a detailed narrative of New York City and the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|power blackout of 1965]]. Agricultural technology is traced to its origins in [[ancient Egypt]] and the invention of the [[plough]]. The segment ends in [[Kuwait]] where, because of [[Crude oil|oil]], society leapt from traditional patterns to advanced technology in a period of only about 30 years.
# "Death in the Morning" examines the standardisation of precious metal with the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from [[Greece]] to [[Persia]], ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and [[library at Alexandria]] which included [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Star catalogue|star table]]s. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators during the [[age of discovery]] 14 centuries later following the introduction of [[lateen sail]]s and [[sternpost rudder]]s. Mariners discovered that the [[compass]]'s magnetised needle did not actually point directly north. Investigations into the nature of [[magnetism]] by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Gilbert]] led to the discovery of electricity by way of the [[Electrostatic generator|sulphur ball]] of [[von Guericke]]. Further interest in [[atmospheric electricity]] at the [[Ben Nevis]] [[weather station]] led to [[C. T. R. Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[cloud chamber]] which in turn allowed development of both [[Robert Watson-Watt|Watson-Watt]]'s [[radar]] and (by way of [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s insights) [[nuclear weaponry]].
# "Distant Voices" suggests that telecommunications exist because [[Normans]] had [[stirrups]] for horse riding which in turn led them to further advancements in warfare. Deep mine shafts flooded and scientists in search of a solution examined [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuums]], air pressure, and other natural phenomena.
# "Faith in Numbers" examines the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] from the perspective of how commercialism, [[climate change]], and the [[Black Death]] influenced cultural development. He examines the impact of [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] waterpower on the Industrial Revolution, derived from [[Roman watermill]] technology such as that of the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]]. Also covered are the Gutenberg printing press, the [[Jacquard loom]], and the Hollerith punch card tabulator that led to modern computer programming.
# "The Wheel of Fortune" traces [[astrological]] knowledge in ancient Greek manuscripts from [[Baghdad]]'s founder, Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], via the Muslim monastery/medical school at [[Gundeshapur]], to the medieval Church's need for alarm clocks (the [[water clock|water horologium]] and the [[verge and foliot]] clock). The clock [[mainspring]] gave way to the [[pendulum clock]], but the latter could not be used by mariners, thus the need for [[Machine tool|precision machining]] by way of [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s improved steel (1797) and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s use (1800) of [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]]'s idea of using a screw to better measure (which he took from the [[Polelathe|turner]]'s trade). This process made a better mainspring and was also used by the Royal Navy to make better [[Block (sailing)|blocks]]. [[Honoré Blanc|Le Blanc]] mentioned this same basic idea to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who transmitted this "[[American system of manufacturing|American system of manufactures]]" – precision machine-tooling of [[musket]] parts for interchangeability – to New Englanders [[Eli Whitney]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]], and [[Simeon North]]. The American efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and his [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|psychologist wife]] later improved the whole new system of the modern [[production line]].
# "Thunder in the Skies" implicates the [[Little Ice Age]] (''[[circa]]'' 1300-1850 AD) in the invention of the [[chimney]], as well as [[knitting]], [[button]]s, [[wainscoting]], [[Tapestry|wall tapestries]], [[Plasterwork|wall plastering]], [[glass window]]s ([[Hardwick Hall]] [1597] has "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the [[steam engine]] is then examined: [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[Newcomen engine|engine]] for pumping water out of mines (1712); [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby]]'s cheap iron from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[James Watt]]'s addition of a second [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensing cylinder]] (for cooling) to the engine (1763); [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773–75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, [[Joseph Priestley]], investigated gases, leading [[Alessandro Volta]] to invent "bad air" ([[marsh gas]]) detectors and ignitors. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Drake]] discovered oil (in [[Pennsylvania]]), allowing [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] (in [[Bad Cannstatt]]) to replace [[town gas]] with gasoline as fuel for [[Siegfried Marcus|auto engine]]s (1883). They also invented (in 1892) the [[carburetor]] (inspired by the medical [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizers]], which also developed from Priestley's work) and a new ignition system inspired by Volta's "bad air" detection spark gun. Finally, piano-maker [[Wilhelm Kress]] unsuccessfully attempted (1901) to fly the first [[seaplane]] on an Austrian lake using the new gasoline engine.
# "The Long Chain" traces the invention of the [[fluyt]] freighter in Holland in the 16th century. Voyages were insured by Edward Lloyd ([[Lloyd's of London]]) if the ships' hulls were covered in pitch and tar (which came from the colonies until the American War of Independence in 1776). In [[Culross]], Scotland, [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald Cochrane (9th Earl of Dundonald)]] tried to [[coal gasification|distill coal vapour]] to get [[coal tar]] for ships' hulls, which led to the discovery of [[ammonia]]. The search for artificial [[quinine]] to treat malaria led to the development of artificial dyes, which Germany used to produce fertilizers to grow wheat and led to the advancement of chemistry which in turn led to [[DuPont]]'s discovery of polymers such as nylon.
# "Eat, Drink and Be Merry..." begins with plastic, the plastic credit card, and the concept of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], then leaps back to the time of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the first state to use credit. The [[Dukes of Burgundy|dukes]] used credit for many luxuries, and to buy more armour for a stronger army. The Swiss opposed the army of Burgundy and invented a new military formation (with [[Swiss pikemen|soldiers using pikes]]) called the [[pike square]]. The pike square, along with events following the French Revolution, set in motion the growth in the size of armies and in the use of ill-trained peasant soldiers. Feeding these large armies became a problem for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], which caused the innovation of bottled food. The bottled food was first put in champagne bottles then in tin cans. [[Canned food]] was used for armies and for navies. In one of the bottles, the canned food went bad, and people blamed the spoiled food on "bad air", also known as swamp air. Investigations around "bad air" and malaria led to the innovation of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]]. In 1892, [[Sir James Dewar]] invented a container that could keep liquids hot or cold (the [[thermos]]) which led three men – [[Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], and [[Hermann Oberth]] – to construct a large thermal flask for either [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]] or for [[solid fuel]] combustion for use in [[rocket propulsion]], applying the thermal flask principle to keep [[rocket fuel]] cold and successfully using it for the [[V-2]] rocket and the [[Saturn V rocket]] that put man on the moon.
# "Countdown" connects the invention of the [[movie projector]] to improvements in castle fortifications caused by the invention and use of the [[cannon]]. The use of the cannon caused changes in castle fortifications to eliminate a blind spot where cannon fire could not reach. This improvement in castle defence caused innovation in offensive cannon fire, which eventually required [[map]]s. Thus, a need arose to view and map locations (like a mountain top) from a long distance, which led to the invention of [[limelight]] light source, and later the [[incandescent light]]. Burke turns to the next ingredient for a movie projector, [[Photographic film|film]]. Film is made with [[celluloid]] (made with [[guncotton]]) which was first invented as a substitute for ivory in [[billiard balls]]. Next was the invention of the [[zoopraxiscope]] which was first used for a bet to see if a horse's hooves all left the ground at any point while galloping. The zoopraxiscope used frame-by-frame pictures and holes on the side to allow the machine to pull the film forward. Communication signals for railways using [[Samuel Morse|Morse]]'s telegraph led to [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] discovering how to speak into a microphone creating bumps on a disc that could be played back—the [[phonograph|record player]]. This final ingredient gave [[Sound film|movies sound]]. In summary, Burke connects the invention of the movie projector to four major innovations in history: the incandescent light, the discovery of celluloid, the projector that uses frame-by-frame pictures on celluloid, and finally, recorded sound.
# "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" recaps the theme that change causes more change. Burke ties together the modern inventions in which previous episodes had culminated: telecommunications, the computer, the jet engine, plastics, rockets, television, the production line, and the atomic bomb. All of these inventions come together in the B-52 nuclear bomber. Start with the plow, you get [[irrigation]], [[pottery]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], [[civilisation]] and writing, mathematics, a [[calendar]] to predict floods, empires, and a [[modern world]] where change happens so rapidly you cannot keep up. What do you do? Stop the change? Throw away all technology and live like cavemen? Decide what change will be allowed by law? Or just accept that the world is changing faster than we can keep up with?

===''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994)===
# "Revolutions" – What do all these things have in common—three grandfathers' lifetimes, two revolutions, 1750 [[Cornish steam engine]]s for Cornwall's tin mines, water in mines, [[pumps]], [[steam engines]], [[James Watt|Watt]]'s copier, [[carbon paper]], [[match]]es, phosphorus [[fertiliser]], trains and [[Gene pool|gene-pool]] mixing, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], 24-hour production, educated women, the telephone, high-rise buildings, [[Damascus steel|Damascus]]'s [[sword]]s, steel, diamond, [[carborundum]], [[graphite]], [[oscilloscope]], television, [[Apollo space program]], [[X-ray]] [[crystallography]], [[DNA]] and [[gene therapy]]? You will learn these things in the first episode of Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, "Revolutions".
# "Sentimental Journeys" – What do these have in common – [[Freud]], lifestyle crisis, [[electric shock therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[magnetism]], [[phrenology]], [[penology]], [[physiology]], [[synthetic dyes]], the [[Bunsen burner]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Fraunhofer lines]], [[astronomical telescope]]s, [[chromatic aberrations]], and [[surveying]]? Follow James Burke on the trail of discovering the connections between these and others in "Sentimental Journeys".
# "Getting it Together" – James Burke explains the relationship between [[hot air balloons]] and [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]], and goes on to surgery, hydraulic-water gardens, [[hydraulic rams]], [[Alpine Tunnel|tunnelling through the Alps]], the [[Orient Express]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[heart attacks]] and [[headaches]], [[aspirin]], [[carbolic acid]], [[disinfectants]], [[Maybach]]-[[Gottlieb Daimler]]-[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], [[carburetors]], [[helicopters]], [[typewriters]], [[punch cards]], and [[IBM]].
# "Whodunit?" – This episode starts with a [[billiard ball]] and ends with a billiard ball. Along the way, Burke examines [[Georgius Agricola]]'s ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', how mining supported war, the role of money, the [[Spanish Armada]], large ships, problems posed by a wood shortage, [[glass making]], coal, [[plate glass]], [[mirror]]s, the [[sextant]], the discovery of [[granite]], and seashells in the mountains, which enabled a new view of the [[age of the earth]], and [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], [[Francis Galton]]'s ''[[Eugenics]]'', and the [[fingerprinting|forensic use of fingerprints]].
# "Something for Nothing" – How do [[space shuttle]] landings start with the [[vacuum]] which was [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|forbidden by the Church]]? Burke takes us on an adventure with barometers, [[weather forecasting]], muddy and blacktop roads, rain [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[sewage]], a [[cholera]] epidemic, [[hygiene]], [[plumbing]], [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[vacuum pump]]s, [[Drill#Types|compressed-air drills]], tunnels in the Alps, [[railway air brake|train air brakes]], [[hydroelectric power]], the [[electric motor]], [[Galvani]]'s [[Muscle electrostimulation#History|muscle-electricity connection]], [[Alessandro Volta#First battery|Volta's battery]], and [[gyroscopes]].
# "Echoes of the Past" – The past in this case starts with the [[Indian tea culture#Dutch exploration|tea in Dutch-ruled India]], examines the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[porcelain]], the architecture of Florence, [[Delftware]], [[Wedgwood]], [[Free Masons]], [[Cryptography|secret codes]], [[radiotelephone|radio-telephones]], [[cosmic background radiation]] and—finally – [[radio astronomy]], which listens to "Echoes of the Past".
# "Photo Finish" – Another series of discoveries examined by Burke includes [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], the [[disappearing elephant scare of 1867]], billiard balls, [[celluloid]] as a substitute for ivory, false teeth that explode, [[gun cotton]], double shot sound of a bullet, [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[shock wave]], [[aerodynamics]], [[nuclear bombs]], [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativity]], Einstein's selenium, [[talkies|movie talkies]], the [[valve audio amplifier|vacuum tube amplifier]], radio, [[Railroad#History|railroad's use of wood]], [[coal tar]], [[gas lighting|gas lights]], [[creosote]], rubber, the [[Zeppelin]], the [[automobile]], and finally how Adeline [[Vulcanization|vulcanise]]s tires.
# "Separate Ways" – Burke shows how to get from sugar to [[atomic weapons]] by two totally independent paths. The first involves [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]], [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist societies]], [[Sampson Lloyd II]], [[wire]], [[suspension bridges]], [[Galvanization#Zinc coatings|galvanised wire]], settlement of the [[Wild West]], [[barbed wire]], canned corn, and [[cadmium]]. The second path involves [[sweet tea]], [[rum]], a [[double boiler]], the steam engine, [[Matthew Boulton]], English currency, the [[pantograph]], [[electroplating]], and [[cathode ray tubes]].
# "High Times" – The connection between [[polyethylene]] and [[Big Ben]] is a few degrees of separation, so let us recount them: polyethylene, [[radar]], soap, artificial dyes, [[color perception]], [[tapestries]], Far East goods, fake lacquer furniture, search for shorter route to Japan, [[Henry Hudson#1607 and 1608 voyages|Hudson in Greenland]], the discovery of plentiful whales, printing the Bible, [[Mercator map]], [[Martin Luther]]'s protest, star tables, Earth as a flattened sphere, and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]'s clock which of course leads to Big Ben.
# "Deja Vu" – James Burke provides evidence that history does repeat itself by examining the likes of [[black and white movie]]s, [[conquistadors]], [[Incas|Peruvian Incas]], [[small pox]], settlements that look like Spain's cities, the gold abundance ending up in [[Belgium]], Antwerp, colony [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], the practice of [[buried treasure|burying treasure]] to avoid pirates, [[Port Royal]]'s pirates, earthquakes, the [[College of William and Mary]], [[military discipline]], [[Alexander Humboldt]]'s observation on the environment, [[Ratzel]]'s superstate ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and [[Karl Haushofer|Haushofer]]'s world domination.
# "New Harmony" – A dream of utopia is followed from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] to Singapore, from the [[transistor]] to its most important element, [[germanium]], to [[Ming vase]]s and cobalt fakes (which contribute to the blue in blue tiles used in special Islamic places), and [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics in Byzantium]], the [[donation of Constantine]], [[Portuguese discoveries#Celestial navigation|Portuguese navigation by stars]], the [[History of Brazil#Beginnings of Brazil|"discovery" of Brazil]], [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|Holland's tolerance]], diamond merchants, [[optics]], [[microscopes]], beasts of science, [[Frankenstein's monster]], and finally [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony.]]
# "Hot Pickle" – Burke starts out in a [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|spice market in Istanbul]] where you can find hot pickle, recounts the [[Byzantium#History|taking of Constantinople by the Turks]] in 1453, follows the trail of pepper, tea, and [[opium]] and the exploitation of addicts, moves to the jungles of [[Java]], then to [[zoos]], the [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|use of canaries]] as carbon monoxide detectors, how [[George Stephenson]] used his consolation prize to build a [[locomotive]], which led to the [[Monitor and Merrimack|battle between the'' Monitor'' and the ''Merrimack'']]. Next we visit a sea island off the coast of South Carolina, where children of slaves are schooled. By the way, they picked cotton, which leads us to [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and [[air conditioning]]. [[Georgia Cayvan]]'s glass dress leads to the [[Neodymium laser|neodymium glass laser]], (which was used in the [[Gulf War]]). And the armed switch for firing a missile is also called a "hot pickle".
# "The Big Spin" is what [[The Big Spin|California's lottery TV show]] is called. And lottery being a game of chance, from here Burke takes us through [[Alexander Fleming]]'s chance discovery of [[penicillin]], to [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s observation that contaminated water is related to health, to [[Schliemann]]'s search for the [[City of Troy]], the theft of a discovered treasure, and to Virchow's criminology. From there we proceed to [[anthropology]], the classification of life forms, [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Mortality rate|statistics of mortality]], [[life expectancy]], [[Statistics#Statistical methods|statistical math]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]'s [[carbonated water]], the [[soda fountain]], [[petroleum oil]], some French fossil hunters, [[seismology]], and impossible-to-predict earthquakes.
# "Bright Ideas" – [[gin and tonic]] was invented to combat malaria in [[British colonies]] like [[Java]], which leads us to [[Geneva]], where cleanliness is an obsession. Here, [[tonic water]] was sealed with a disposable bottle cap, and [[disposable razor|razors became disposable]], leading us to [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s steel, invaluable for making [[clock]] springs. We take a little trip through [[lighthouses]], the education of orphans, [[psycho-physics]], the law of the [[just noticeable difference]], which is the idea behind [[stellar magnitude]]s, which leads us to discovering the [[size of the universe]].
# "Making Waves" – a [[permanent wave]] in ladies' hair is aided by [[curlers]], and this leads us to explore [[borax]], taking us to Switzerland, [[Johann Sutter]]'s scam, and [[Sutter's Mill]], and that means the discovery of gold leading to the 1848 [[California gold rush]]. Americans then cut into the English tea market with the aide of the ''[[Clipper|Yankee Clipper]]'', which played a big role in the gold rush. A fungus from America created the [[Irish potato famine]], resulting in the importing of corn, but laws prevented the Yankee clippers from being used until it was too late to save Ireland. Finally, the laws were changed, leading to franking fraud, which was overcome by special printing of postage stamps, which gave us [[wallpaper]], and a thickening agent, leading us to the [[Canal du Midi]], the [[American War of Independence|American war for independence]], resettlement in Scotland, [[Highland Clearances|highlanders]] in Nova Scotia and—finally—the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].
# "Routes" – [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], a sick English lawyer, recuperates sipping wine and contributes the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] to help fix farming problems. Farm production is not going so well in France, either. [[François Quesnay]] (doctor of King Louis XV's mistress) suggests a solution based on his complete misunderstanding of English farming techniques. ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' was his erroneous idea. It also got the people to demand social ''laissez-faire''. His inciting the public's rebellion against the [[French monarchy|monarchy]] led to France's invasion of Geneva. The [[French Revolution]] led to personal exploration of the senses. Berlin doctor Müller reasoned that each sense does a different job and the nervous system analyses what the senses are telling one. Helmholtz's pupil, Hertz, discovered that sound and electricity have a wave-like nature in common. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] takes this a step further by sending and receiving signals very long distances across the earth. The [[BBC]] realised that the radio waves were reflected by the ionosphere, and Hess was the first to suggest that the ionization was due to "Hess rays" later related to solar activity. But [[World War II]] started and [[adding machines]] were needed to aim artillery, so [[digital computing]] was invented. Thus was enabled the [[GPS]] which tells travelers their "Routes".
# "One Word" – The one word that changed everything was "[[filioque]]", but we must make a trip to [[Constantinople]], visit the [[Renaissance]], meet [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]], explore [[abbreviations]], learn about [[Italic type|Italic print]], which resulted in an overload of books, requiring the development of a cataloguing system, which was complicated for those seeking education, where [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] was innovating with pictorial textbooks. And that brings us to church intolerance, [[James Watt]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[cerium]], the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Gauss's mathematics, and [[cultural anthropology]].
# "Sign Here" – [[Murphy's Law]] says you need insurance from [[Lloyd's of London]], so pack your bags to study [[international law]] and protect yourself from piracy by calculating the probability. You better study Pascal's math for that, but you might find yourself jailed for [[free thinking]]. While you are in jail, study some [[sign language]], or at least learn to speak better than [[Eliza Doolittle]]. [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]]'s waveform recordings lead you to the telephone, the invention of [[shorthand]], the [[radiometer]], gas flow, the [[Wright brothers]]' aeroplane, [[lubrication]], [[ball bearings]] and a [[ballpoint pen]] so you can "Sign Here".
# "Better Than the Real Thing"  starts in the 1890s with bicycles and [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and then takes a look at [[boots]], [[zippers]], [[sewing machines]], and infinitesimal difference. Speaking of small, we look at microscopic [[Microorganism|germs]], [[polarized light]], sugar, coal, iron, microbubbles, the [[spectroscope]], [[night vision]], [[beriberi]] resulting from [[polished rice]], chickens, war rationing, and finally, we arrive at [[Vitamin pill|vitamins in a pill]].
# "Flexible Response" is a whimsical look at the myth of the [[English longbow]], [[Robin Hood]], sheep, the need to drain land with [[windmills]], the effect of [[compound interest]], [[decimal fractions]] (wrongly pointing to the USA not Russia as the first country with [[decimal currency]], in fact USA did not exist at the time of Russian decimalisation in 1704), increased [[productivity]], the [[Erie Canal]], railroads, [[telegraphs]], [[department stores]], [[Quaker Oats]], X-ray diagnostics, [[biofeedback]], and [[servo control]] systems in a [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft.

===''Connections³'' (1997)===
# "Feedback" – Electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by [[Claude Bernard]], whose vivisection experiments kick off animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there that are using [[Matthew Maury]]'s data on wind and currents transmitted by the radio telegraph, invented by [[Samuel Morse]], who is also a painter whose hero is [[Washington Allston]], who spends time in Italy with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who comes to [[Malta]] and spies for the governor [[Alexander Ball]], who saved Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s skin so he can go head over heels for [[Emma Hamilton]] in Naples, resulting in an illegitimate son. Emma became notable in the [[James Graham (sexologist)#The Celestial Bed|Electrico-Magnetico Celestial Bed]], where you go regain your fertility through electricity, and you can get more whisky thanks to [[Joseph Black]], who determined the latent heat of vaporisation in steam. [[James Watt]] borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper. The paper is used for decorating walls by [[William Morris]],  who is a socialist with [[Annie Besant]], who is a vegetarian just like the [[Seventh-day Adventists]]. And we end up with [[W.K. Kellogg]]'s cornflakes.
# "What's in a Name?" – Remember the cornflakes from last episode? Because corncobs make adhesives to bond [[carborundum]] discovered by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs, silicon carbide is also then used as protection against armour-piercing shells developed to hit tanks that start life as American tractors, which use diesel engines developed from funding from [[Krupp]], who inspired Bismarck's welfare scheme based on [[Adolphe Quetelet|Quetelet's]] statistics that inspired the [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], whose [[punch cards]] were used to rivet the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], the monster ship that laid the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] insulated with [[gutta-percha]] used to manufacture golf balls for factory managers in industrial Scotland, where James Watt had a run-in with [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]], whose protegee was James Macie, also called [[James Smithson]], who caused all the row in the capitol building, so the money got used to set up a world-renowned institution named after James Macie's new family name, which was Smithson: The institution known as the [[Smithsonian]].
# "Drop the Apple" – At the Smithsonian, we learn of electric crystals that help Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discover what they call radium, and then Langevin uses the piezoelectric crystal to develop sonar that helps save Liberty ships (from German U-boats) put together with welding techniques using acetylene made with carbon arcs, also working the arc lights with clockwork regulators built by Foucault, whose pendulum helps him to take pictures of solar eclipses. Also thanks to ash from seaweed, [[interchangeable parts]] for clocks, the world of opera, and gurus, we get Einstein's theory of the gravity effect, which means Newton's universe is gone and you can drop the apple.
# "An Invisible Object" – Black holes in space, seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]], brought into space with hydrazine fuel, which was a byproduct of fungicides for French vines, fuelled by quarantine conventions and money orders, [[American Express]] and [[Buffalo Bill]], Vaudeville and French battles, [[Joan of Arc]] and the Inquisition, Jews welcomed by Turks, who lost to Maltese knights with surgeons trained on pictures by [[Titian]], in [[Augsburg]], where goldsmiths made French money to pay for tobacco. That triggered logarithms and slide rules made by clock makers, who also made pressure cookers that sterilised French beer kept cool by refrigerators that were also used to freeze meat and chill down paraffin wax for making objects invisible.
# "Life is No Picnic" – Instant coffee gets off the ground in World War II and Jeeps lead to nylons and stocking machines smashed by [[Luddites]], who were defended by [[Lord Byron]], who meets [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Turkey, avoiding the same blockade that inspires the "Star-Spangled Banner", which was really an English song all about a Greek poet discovered by a publisher whose son-in-law is pals with [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] of chronology fame, whose military boss, Maurice, inspires [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]], father of the runaway [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], whose teacher [[René Descartes]]' mechanical universe inspires the book about brains by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Willis]], which is illustrated by the architect of St. Paul's, [[Christopher Wren]], who dabbles in investments like [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s Louisiana scam that ruins France, and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and later the French finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], whose daughter is the opinionated [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|de Stael]], whose romantic pals get [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] looking into jellyfish so he can defend [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. This demonstrates that "Life is No Picnic".
# "Elementary Stuff" – [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who studied beetles, [[Oliver Lodge]] and telegraphy, a radio designed by [[Reginald Fessenden]], which was used by banana growers, studied by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]], who got the Swiss to use stamps on postcards with cartoons of Gothic houses of parliament, which in turn had been inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s Romantic movement, inspired by fake Scottish poems. The exiled Scots escaped to North Carolina, producing turpentine, which helped make Chinese lacquer on tinplate, which is for what [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] had hoped. French navy decorator [[Pierre Paul Puget]], who paints pictures of locations where barometers are the subject of investigation. The weather experimenter, whose brother's writing turns on Swift, whose pal Berkeley has visual theories that Young confirms while decoding ancient Egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by French balloonists. The American balloons are used for spying by [[Allan Pinkerton]] and his intrepid agent [[James McParland]], who becomes famous in England because of [[Conan Doyle]].
# "A Special Place" – Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffries]] of Leicester University in England develops DNA profiling and schlieren photography used by [[Theodore von Karman]] to study aerodynamics and [[Anthony Fokker]]'s airborne machine guns and the [[Red Baron]] and geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s romantic ideas that start in Italy and paintings of actors and lighthouses and the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] and Spanish gold and [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] and [[William Cheselden]]'s skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing aficionados who write books and [[Charles Cotton]] and sceptical wine-drinkers called [[Michel Eyquem]], and [[Edward Jenner]]'s cure for smallpox and [[J.J. Audubon]] and American bird painters and devious Russian real estate deals, and as a result in 1872, America gets a special place, the first national park, Yellowstone.
# "Fire from the Sky" –   Due to [[continental drift]] and [[Alfred Wegener]]'s passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of [[King Arthur]], whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval [[courtly love]] answers to adultery, which were in turn inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical [[Catharism|Cathars]], who lived next to the mystical [[Christian Kabbalah|cabalists]] who were fascinated with mystic numbers that spark [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Pico of Mirandola]]'s interest in Hebrew, which then brings trouble for [[Johann Reuchlin]], not helped by his nephew, the [[Protestant]] [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], who had a feud with [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]], who rewrites the work of [[Copernicus]]. Osiander's Italian pal, Dr. [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], who cures the asthmatic [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], executed for helping [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], whose lover, the explosive-bearing [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], ends up in Scandinavia with a friend of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], whose assistant, [[Willem Blaeu]], makes maps updated in the first true atlas by the Englishman Dudley, working in Italy for [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], who got opera started, which was a rave success, especially with the French [[Cardinal Mazarin]], whose library inspired [[Samuel Pepys|the secretary of the English navy]], which eventually buys French [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], after which [[Canning|Gamble]] gets the patent for canned food that feeds explorers like [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], who transplanted rubber trees to [[Sri Lanka]]. As a result of all that, we have rubber to mix with gasoline to make [[napalm]], which is "Fire from the Sky".
# "Hit the Water" – Thanks to napalm, made with [[palm oil]], also used for [[margarine]], stiffened with a process using [[kieselguhr]] that comes from [[plankton]] living in currents studied by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Ballot]] before observing the [[Doppler effect]] that caused [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] to measure the speed of light. Fizeau's father-in-law's friend, [[Prosper Mérimée]], who wrote "[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]"...&amp;nbsp;his friend, [[Anthony Panizzi]], who works at the British Museum, opened to house the collection of [[Hans Sloane]], who treats Lady Montague's smallpox before she sees Turkish tulips, first drawn by Gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with France, which was the first to develop military music and choreography, used in a London show by [[John Gay]], whose friend Arbuthnot does statistics that impress the Dutch mathematician who knows [[Voltaire]], who hears from the worm-slicing [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who stars in the story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Judge Hoffman]], who tries German nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the [[YMCA]] and the man who started the [[Red Cross]], who need a way to figure out blood types, surgical stitching and the perfusion pump invented by [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to [[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']], [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']], and the German invasion of Norway and the Allied commandos whose mission was to "Hit the Water".
# "In Touch" – Starting from an attempt for cheaper fusion power using superconductivity, which was discovered by Onnes, with liquid gas provided by [[Louis-Paul Cailletet]], who carried out experiments on a [[Eiffel Tower|tower]] built by [[Gustave Eiffel]], who also built the [[Statue of Liberty]] with its famous poem by the Jewish activist [[Emma Lazarus]], helped by [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Oliphant]], whose boss Elgin was the son of the man who stole the [[Elgin Marbles]] and sold them with the help of royal painter [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose colleague [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] had an assistant whose wife's lodger was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who charted the [[Gulf Stream]] with a thermometer [[Fahrenheit]] borrowed from [[Ole Rømer]], whose friend [[Jean Picard|Picard]] surveyed Versailles and provided the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspired [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel]] to write the book on gardening that was read by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], who hired the Scottish stonemason [[Thomas Telford]], whose idea for [[London Bridge]] was turned down by Thomas Young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do Hertz's electricity waves, with which Helmholtz prods a frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, Klages, analyses handwriting so individual post codes have to be capital letters to get your mail to a jungle village to keep you "In Touch".

==Related works==
All three ''Connections'' documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.

Burke also wrote a series of ''Connections'' articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and published a book of the same name (1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.

Burke produced another documentary series called ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original ''Connections''.

''{{YouTube|user=ArtOfTheProblem|title=Art of the Problem}}'' is a video series launched in 2011 on [[Kickstarter.com]] that was inspired by James Burke's ''Connections''. However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.

''[[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]]'', shown on [[BBC2]], follows a similar format.

===In video games===
''Connections'', a ''[[Myst]]''-style computer game with James Burke and others providing video footage and voice acting, was released in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/connections Connections – MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a runner-up for ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s award for the best "Classics/Puzzles" game of 1995, which ultimately went to ''[[You Don't Know Jack (1995 video game)|You Don't Know Jack]]''. The editors wrote of ''Connections'', "That you enjoy yourself so much you hardly realize that you're learning is a tribute to the design."&lt;ref name=cgw1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff |title=The Computer Gaming World 1996 Premier Awards |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] |issue=143 |date=June 1996 |pages=55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation''' is an [[ethic]] of resource use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the [[Natural environment|natural world]], its [[fishery|fisheries]], [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], and [[biological diversity]]. Secondary focus is on material conservation, including [[non-renewable resources]] such as metals, minerals and [[fossil fuels]], and [[energy conservation]], which is important to protect the natural world. Those who follow the conservation ethic and, especially, those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed [[Conservation movement|conservationists]].

The terms ''conservation'' and ''preservation'' are frequently conflated outside the academic, scientific, and professional kinds of literature. The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:

″Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, ''conservation seeks the proper use of nature, while preservation seeks protection of nature from use''.

During the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the early 20th century, two opposing factions emerged: conservationists and preservationists. Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether.″&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/education/classrooms/conservation-vs-preservation.htm National Park Service: Conservation versus preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
To [[habitat conservation|conserve habitat]] in [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s and to stop [[deforestation]] is a goal widely shared by many groups with a wide variety of motivations.

To protect sea life from [[extinction]] due to [[overfishing]] or [[climate change]] is another commonly stated goal of conservation – ensuring that "some will be available for future generations" to continue a way of life.

The consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the ''four R's'': " Rethink, Reduce, Recycle, Repair"
This social ethic primarily relates to [[local purchasing]], [[moral purchasing]], the [[sustainability|sustained]], and efficient use of [[renewable resource]]s, the moderation of destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution|water]] quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a [[built environment]].

The principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value – a view carried forward by the scientific [[conservation movement]] and some of the older [[Romanticism|Romantic]] schools of [[ecology movement]].

More [[utilitarian ethics|Utilitarian]] schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of [[Human impact on the environment|local and global impacts of human activity]] upon nature in their effect upon human [[measuring well-being|well being]], now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social, political, and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced. This is a view common in the modern [[environmental movement]].

These movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the [[conservation movement]].

In the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous publication of [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man. From [[George Perkins Marsh]] a very different book, ''[[Man and Nature]]'', later subtitled "The Earth as Modified by Human Action", catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives.

== Terminology ==
{{quote box
|quote=The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem. Unless we solve that problem, it will avail us little to solve all others.|source=[[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt, Address to the Deep Waterway Convention

|width=25%
|align=right}}

In common usage, the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests, including biological diversity. [[Carl F. Jordan]] defines the term as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan |first=Carl|title=Replacing Quantity With Quality As a Goal for Global Management|publisher=Wiley |date=1995|isbn=0-471-59515-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|biological '''conservation''' as being a philosophy of managing the environment in a manner that does not despoil, exhaust or extinguish.}}

While this usage is not new, the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology, [[bio geography]], [[anthropology]], economy and sociology to maintain  [[biodiversity]].

The term "conservation" itself may cover the concepts such as [[cultural diversity]], [[genetic diversity]] and the concept of movements [[environmental conservation]], [[seedbank]] (preservation of seeds). These are often summarized as the priority to [[respect diversity]], especially by [[Green movement|Greens]].

Much recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to [[commercialism]] and [[globalization]]. [[Slow Food]] is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities, and embracing a [[voluntary simplicity|slower and more locally focused lifestyle]].

== Practice ==
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]

Distinct trends exist regarding conservation development. While many countries' efforts to preserve [[species]] and their [[habitats]] have been government-led, those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in [[natural history]], expressed at the level of the individual and the national, regional or local [[learned society]]. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term [[NGOs]] – in the shape of the [[RSPB]], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were [[national parks]] and [[national nature reserve]]s. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in [[laissez-faire]] government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that [[John Muir]], the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]]. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.

Protected areas in developing countries, where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, such is the case of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haciendachichen.com/eco-design.htm Haciendachichen.com], "The Importance of Eco-Design"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.

One of the world's foremost conservationists, Dr.Kenton Miller, stated about the importance of Rangers: "The future of our [[ecosystem services]] and our heritage depends upon park rangers. With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing, there has never been more of a need for well-prepared human capacity to manage. Park rangers are the backbone of park management. They are on the ground. They work on the front line with scientists, visitors, and members of local communities."

Adopt A Ranger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org Adopt-a-ranger.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703033240/http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org/ |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75% of the world. Currently, no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem. Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries: protected areas without field staff. Very specifically, it will contribute to solving the problem by fundraising to finance rangers in the field. It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies.

Others, including [[Survival International]], have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples, who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide cost-effective protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/conservation Tribal Conservationists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation of taxidermy''' is the ongoing maintenance and preservation of zoological specimens that have been mounted or stuffed for display and study. [[Taxidermy]] specimens contain a variety of organic materials, such as fur, bone, feathers, skin, and wood, as well as inorganic materials, such as burlap, glass, and foam. Due to their composite nature, taxidermy specimens require special care and conservation treatments for the different materials.

== Types and uses ==
[[File:Common Blackbird at BNHS.jpg|thumb|Example of a study skin]]
[[File:White Memorial Conservation Center 12 - museum display about taxidermy.jpg|thumb|Display with different examples of support forms]]
Traditional [[taxidermy]] specimens are cleaned and preserved animal skins that have been mounted over a form.&lt;ref name=1natsca&gt;NatSCA. Taxidermy and Skins. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt; Full mounts are the entire specimen, while shoulder mounts only include the head, neck, and shoulders. Study skins are another form of taxidermy in which the skins of small mammals and birds are stuffed with cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers in order to support the skin and original body shape.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates&gt;Carter, D. &amp; Walker, A. K. (1999). Chapter 1: Vertebrates. Care and Conservation of Natural History Collections. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/care-and-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically used by researchers rather than put on display.

Taxidermy has a robust [[History of taxidermy|history]], and specimens can be found in a number of public and private institutions, as well as personal collections. Natural history museums, zoos, science &amp; nature centers, historic houses, art museums, and children’s museums are examples of institutions that may have taxidermy specimens in their collections.&lt;ref name=3trophies&gt;Troublesome Trophies and Fragile Feathered Friends: Introduction to the Care of Historic Taxidermy webinar. Retrieved from http://www.connectingtocollections.org/troublesome-trophies-and-fragile-feathered-friends-introduction-to-the-care-of-historic-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While it may not be necessary to conserve mounts or skins of commonly occurring animals beyond educational use,&lt;ref name=4handbook&gt;National Park Service Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/mushbkI.html&lt;/ref&gt; some taxidermy mounts represent extinct or critically endangered species. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History houses Martha, the last [[passenger pigeon]] and a some collections still have [[Great Auk]] specimens, a bird species that went extinct in 1844.&lt;ref name=1natsca /&gt;

== Causes of deterioration ==
As with other types of collections, taxidermy specimens are susceptible to agents of deterioration, including pests, lights, temperature, humidity, and custodial neglect. Improper storage, display, and handling of taxidermy specimens can lead to many of these causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt;

=== Pest damage ===
Pests, such as [[Dermestid Beetle|dermestid beetles]], clothes moths, and rodents, can cause damage to taxidermy specimens by eating materials and leaving larvae husks behind. Dermestid beetles in particular can digest keratin and will feed on hair, horns, and feathers.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; Signs of a pest infestation in taxidermy include small piles of dust (known as frass) underneath a specimen and shedding skin from growing larvae.&lt;ref name=5natsca&gt;NatSCA and ICON. Care and Conservation of Zoological Specimens. Retrieved from http://natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications-full/care-and-conservation-of-zoological-specimens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additional signs of an infestation include chewing marks, loss of hair, fur, or feathers on mounts, webbing, and fecal pellets or stains.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service Conserve O Gram. Identifying Museum Insect Pest Damage. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/03-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental damage ===

==== Pollutants ====
Over time, taxidermy specimens can accumulate layers of dust, dirt, and other airborne pollutants, especially if they are house on open shelving or display. Additionally, cases and containers made of unstable materials can off gas pollutants, such as H2s, SO2, formaldehyde, peroxides, and organic acids, which can damage the surfaces of taxidermy.&lt;ref name=7standards&gt;Standards in the Care of Skins and Taxidermy Collections. Retrieved from http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Light ====
Fading of fur, feathers, and skins is almost exclusively caused by improper lighting conditions, such as long-term exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) light]]. UV light can come from both natural and artificial lighting sources.

==== Temperature ====
Specimens may lose fur or feathers when exposed to warm environments because the high temperature causes residual fats in skins to release.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

==== Humidity ====
Taxidermy specimens are especially susceptible to fluctuations in humidity due to their composite materials. Relative humidity fluctuations below 40% can cause greater damage than fluctuations above 40%.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Dry environments with low humidity may cause de-lamination or cracking in horns, bones, and turtle shells. Additionally, dry environments can cause skins and leathers to contract and shrink over the support form, which eventually leads to cracking and splitting. High humidity and moist environments can promote mold growth and attract pests. Bones will contract and swell due to humidity fluctuations, which may lead to cracking and splitting.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; This may lead to further structural damage if the bones are used as support within the specimen.

=== Damage caused by humans ===

==== Improper handling ====
Breakage of appendages is likely to occur if specimens are not properly handled. Bird specimens are especially susceptible to breaking at the neck,&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; while mammals’ ears tend to be the first component to break or become disfigured.

==== Packing and shipping ====
Given their unique shape and form, taxidermy specimens can be difficult to ship and if not packed properly, can be easily damaged. Ears, necks, and birds’ beaks can break or bend during shipment if not properly supported.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt;

==== Theft and vandalism ====
[[File:Stolen Rhinoceros horn 2.jpg|thumb|Rhinoceros specimen with missing horn due to theft]]
Some taxidermy specimens are vulnerable to direct damage by humans, especially if the species is associated with a valuable body part. Thieves may opt to take only part of a taxidermy specimen, which can impact the structural integrity of the entire specimen.

=== Inherent vice ===
Sometimes taxidermy specimens are susceptible to damage that is difficult to avoid and inherent to the nature of taxidermy. Metals, such as nickel and copper, used in support structures and forms can react to fatty acids in skins and cause corrosion.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Gravity can also negatively impact taxidermy specimens by pulling unsupported components, such as tails and horns, away from the main structure, thus causing tears and breaks.&lt;ref name=3trophies /&gt; Gravitational damage typically occurs with specimens on display, where support structures are not part of a diorama or case. However, hanging study skins in storage experience a gravitational pull that causes stretching and tearing of the skins.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Hazardous materials in taxidermy ==
Before extensive handling, hands-on display use &lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; or conservation treatments are carried out, it is important to test taxidermy specimens for hazardous materials. [[Arsenic]], mercury, [[napthalene]], paradichlorobenze, [[asbestos]], and [[DDT]] are all commonly found in taxidermy collections.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=8pesticides&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Residual Pesticides. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/residual-pesticides&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals were used to treat skins during preparation and helped reduce mold and pest damage. However, they can cause serious health concerns and illness in humans. Conservators may test for the presence of these hazardous materials in order to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In addition to testing, conservators may also review museum records, inspect specimens, or examine storage areas to determine what hazardous materials may be present.&lt;ref name=8pesticides /&gt;

== Conservation and restoration treatments ==
Treatments should be carried out by conservators or qualified taxidermists. Some taxidermists have experience working with museums and can coordinate with conservators to preserve specimens. When cleaning specimens, it is necessary to wear protective gear such as nitrile gloves, dust masks, eye protection, and lab coats.

=== Basic cleaning ===
Taxidermy specimens can gather dirt and dust over time and may only need basic remedial treatments to be conserved. Basic cleaning can be done on a regular basis to help keep specimens in good condition.

==== Fur ==== 
[[File:Taxidermied tiger head, Natural History Museum, Berlin, Germany - 20101107.jpg|thumb|Example of fur on a tiger specimen]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of fur objects}}
[[Fur]] may be gently cleaned with a soft-bristled brush or comb, which will help loosen particulates that have built up. A vacuum with a soft brush attachment will also work to remove dust and dirt.	For particularly dirty furs, conservators may opt to wash the specimen’s fur with water and a mild detergent or soap. If a mount has been exposed to fire and is covered with fine soot, a smoke sponge may be used to wipe down the fur. Some taxidermists promote cleaning of fur with furniture polish, however, this method will cause wax to build up and eventually dull the color of the fur.&lt;ref name=9carolina&gt;Carolina Conservation blog. Cleaning Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://carolinaconservation.wordpress.com/tag/cleaning-taxidermy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feathers ====
[[File:Ardea cinerea - Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin - DSC00189.JPG|thumb|A variety of feathers are present on some bird specimens (Great Blue Heron pictured)]]
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of feathers}}
Dust and dirt can accumulate feathers and can be cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft bristled brush or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents may be needed to clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, S. (1996). Cleaning Mounted Birds. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1996/1168.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin ====
Exposed skin on a mount, such as noses, mouths, or birds’ feet, may be cleaned with a soft microfiber cloth or brush. Some birds’ feet may be artificially colored and will not react well if solvents are applied.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Bone, horns and antler objects ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects}}
Horns that are starting to crack may be treated with conservation-grade beeswax polish that will help protect against dehydration.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; Beaks are another component of taxidermy specimens that are typically artificially colored and should only be cleaned with brushes and soft clothes.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

==== Glass components ====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
Taxidermy specimens have glass eyes that can be gently cleaned with glass cleaner.&lt;ref name=9carolina /&gt;

=== Repair and restoration techniques ===
If a taxidermy specimen has been significantly damaged, conservators may have to use more thorough and sometimes invasive techniques to restore them. These techniques can help to stabilize the specimen's condition while also restoring the appearance to be more scientifically accurate. Before undertaking any repairs, conservators use a variety of imaging techniques, such as photography and x-rays, to get a good idea of the structure and level of damage of the specimen.

==== Structural repair ====
Fill materials may be used on taxidermy specimens to correct areas of loss. It is important that the specimen is in stable condition because many fill materials have drawbacks that can further damage the specimen.  Fills typically consist of a backing made of inert fabric combined with a resin, starch, or cellulose ether.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, L. (1998). Synthetic Fill Materials for Skins, Leathers, and Furs. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bird specimens that have been badly damaged by pests may be repaired with a mixture of synthetic fabrics and wheat starch. This mixture is used to infill areas of loss and feathers are replaced where possible with a wheat starch paste adhesive. In addition to infilling, taxidermy specimens may require structural repairs. Small specimens that have experienced loss of a head or appendage, a new wire armature may be inserted into the specimen in order to remount the broken piece. Adhesive can be used to further secure the broken piece to its original body.&lt;ref&gt;Horniman Museum and Gardens. Conserving Our Taxidermy. Retrieved from http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recoloring fur ====
A relatively recent development in taxidermy restoration, metal complex dyes have been used to recolor fur. The [[American Museum of Natural History]] performed extensive research and tests using these dyes to recolor the furs of taxidermy specimens during the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. Many of the dyes have a high lightfastness and are more resistant to fading. When applied to fur, they also allow for a more natural look and feel. Another major benefit to using dyes, as opposed to acrylic paints, to recolor fur is they are reversible. The dyes can be reduced or entirely removed with application of ethanol. Research is still being done into the dyes’ lightfastness and fixability, as well as whether or not they cause the fur to degrade over time.&lt;ref name=13true&gt;In Their True Colors blog. A Horse of a Different Color: Researching Colorants for Recoloring Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://intheirtruecolors.wordpress.com/category/renovation-of-the-bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diorama repair ====
3D printing is a newer method being used to replace foliage in some dioramas because it can quickly replicate hundreds of leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University. 3D Printing: Restoring Museum Dioramas. Retrieved from http://dmca.yalecollege.yale.edu/news/3d-printing-restoring-museum-exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pest treatments ====
Pests may be treated with a number of methods, including freezing, insecticide, or anoxia.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt; These treatments help kill off adults and larvae, though specimens may require additional cleaning and stabilization after these treatments are performed.

== Preventative care and maintenance ==
In order to prolong the life of a taxidermy specimen, it is necessary for museums and conservators to implement [[Collections care|preventative care]] and maintenance strategies. These strategies help protect specimens from damage caused by humidity, temperature, pests, humans, and more.

=== Proper storage and display conditions ===
One of the most effective ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).
Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens.&lt;ref name=13true /&gt; Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light.&lt;ref name=4handbook /&gt; 
Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt; An [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.

=== Proper handling ===
Proper handling techniques are essential to protect specimens from damage. Conservators will inspect taxidermy specimens for signs of weakness or detachable parts before moving the object. It is important for anyone handling taxidermy to remove jewelry, such as watches, rings, or bracelets, that may scratch or snag parts of the specimen. If the taxidermy specimen is mounted on a base or in a tray, it is preferred to only handle the base or tray while moving the object, rather than the specimen itself. Conservators will also use a secondary support, such as padding, to support the taxidermy specimen while in transit.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Specimen Handling Checklist. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/preventive-conservation&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing nitrile gloves while handling specimens will help prevent oil and perspiration transfer.&lt;ref name=5natsca /&gt;

=== Packing and shipping ===
Bases of taxidermy mounts should be affixed to a shipping container with screws, straps, staples or tapes, with light and loose packing materials supporting the specimen’s structure.&lt;ref name=2vertebrates /&gt; This keeps the specimen stable during shipment, and informs the receiver which way the specimen is oriented within the container. Additionally, polystyrene or polyethylene bags may be used to cover taxidermy specimens during shipment.&lt;ref name=7standards /&gt;

== Notable Examples ==
=== American Museum of Natural History mammal hall ===
[[File:Alaska Moose at the American Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|Alaska moose diorama at the American Museum of Natural History in 2012, after restoration]]
In 2011-2012, the [[American Museum of Natural History]] undertook the restoration of 43 dioramas in its Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. In addition to repairing mounts, conservators worked on restoring the dioramas’ set pieces and background paintings.&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History. Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/bernard-family-hall-of-north-american-mammals&lt;/ref&gt; In order to restore the taxidermy mounts and specimens, conservators removed smaller animals from the dioramas and built temporary scaffolding around larger animals, such as the 500-pound bison. Many of the larger mounts are affixed to their diorama case and could not easily be moved without risking further damage. One of the main goals of the project was to bring back scientific accuracy to the specimens, including their fur coloring. The museum’s conservators tested and developed a new method of treatment for recoloring furs that uses metal dyes instead of traditional materials, such as paints and hair dyes. Other details of specimens were updated and restored - the cougar’s whiskers were replaced with porcupine quills to give the face a fuller appearance and veins were added to the antelope jackrabbit’s ears to give a realistic appearance. In order to protect the restored taxidermy specimens and dioramas, UV-filtered lights were installed throughout the mammal hall.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific America. New Technology for Old Dioramas. Retrieved from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-technology-old-dioramas/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Postal Museum’s "Owney"===
[[File:OwneyDog.jpg|thumb|Owney, before treatments]]
In 2011, the Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum restored its beloved “Owney”, the canine mascot of the Railway Mail Service. Owney was taxidermied in 1987 and had undergone previous restoration attempts. Using new methods and treatments, conservators removed dust, built-up wax, paint, and traces of arsenic. They also reshaped his face to be more accurate based on photographic evidence, as well as replaced his vest with a more accurate leather harness. As a result of the restoration, Owney’s fur is fuller, his tail is fluffier, and he has a more historically accurate appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Postal Museum Blog.

===Napoleon’s Horse "Vizir"===
Almost 200 years old, Vizir was one of Napoleon Bonaparte’s horses, and its mount has been on display at the Musee de l’Armee in Paris. The horse was showing significant signs of deterioration and a campaign was launched to fund its restoration. Conservators and taxidermists worked to rehydrate the skin, repair tears in the body, and restore coloration to the fur. Once the treatments were completed, Vizir was placed in a climate-controlled case to prevent further deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Hyperallergic. Taxidermists Restore Napoleon’s Beloved White Horse. Retrieved from  https://hyperallergic.com/310371/taxidermists-restore-napoleons-beloved-white-horse/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry the Elephant===
The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History revamped its main rotunda in 2015, and restored its centerpiece elephant, Henry, which has been on display since 1959. Previous restorations have been performed, including one in the 1970s that involved replacing the tusks with fiberglass replicas to reduce stress on the specimen. The elephant was dusted and vacuumed to remove debris, then waxes were used to infill cracks and make other repairs. The skin was retextured and recolored to more closely resemble an elephant hide.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. How a Museum Gives an Elephant a Facelift.

[[File:Mount Storm Power Plant, Areial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Storm Lake]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} cooling pond for a power plant in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].]]
A '''cooling pond''' is a man-made body of [[water]] primarily formed for the purpose storing heated water and/or supplying [[cooling water]] to a nearby [[power plant]] or industrial facility such as a [[petroleum refining|petroleum refinery]], [[pulp and paper mill]], [[chemical plant]], [[steel mill]] or [[smelter]].

==Overview==
Cooling ponds are used where sufficient land is available, as an alternative to [[cooling tower]]s or discharging of heated water to a nearby [[river]] or [[coastal waters|coastal bay]], a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause [[thermal pollution]] of the receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Science |last1=Mongillo |first1=John F. |last2=Zierdt-Warshaw |first2=Linda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |location=Rochester, NY |isbn=978-1-57356-147-1 |page=93 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Environmental Planning |last1=Dunne |first1=Thomas |last2=Leopold |first2=Luna B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=[[W.H. Freeman]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7167-0079-1 |page=722 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling ponds are also sometimes used with [[HVAC|air conditioning systems]] in large buildings as an alternative to cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Refrigeration and Air Conditioning |last=Ananthanarayanan |first=P.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location= |isbn=978-0-07-049500-5 |page=218 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond receives [[thermal energy]] in the water from the plant’s [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] during the process of energy production and the thermal energy is then dissipated mainly through [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, D.C. (1970). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100H0DE.txt “An Engineering-Economic Study of Cooling Pond Performance.”] Document no. 16130DFX0570. Water Pollution Control Research Series. p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, Harlan (2010). [http://www.brighthub.com/engineering/mechanical/articles/64576.aspx “Steam Power Plant Condenser Cooling—Part 1: Introduction to Alternatives.”] brighthub.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the water has cooled in the pond, it is reused by the plant. New water is added to the system (“make-up” water) to replace the water lost through evaporation.

A 1970 cooling pond research study done by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] stated cooling ponds as having a lower overall electrical cost than [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]] while providing the same benefits. They also concluded that a cooling pond will work optimally within 5 degrees Fahrenheit of natural water temperature with an area encompassing approximately 4 acres per megawatt of dissipated thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_32156|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Lake Anna is a cooling pond in Virginia, which provides cooling water for the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. This pond has recreational uses such as  fishing, swimming, boating, camping, and picnicking as well as being a cooling pond for the nuclear plant. Chernobyl's cooling pond has abundant wildlife, despite the radiation present in the area. Some accounts of wels catfish ''(Silurus glanis)'' growing up to 350 pounds and having a lifespan of up to 50 years in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/yes-there-are-giant-catfish-in-chernobyls-cooling-pond-but-theyre-not-radiation-mutants/|title=Yes, there are giant catfish in Chernobyl's cooling pond – but they're not radiation mutants|work=Earth Touch News Network|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia station in Pardeeville, Wisconsin is a coal fired power plant with a capacity of 1000 MW. A duel cooling system is used for heat rejection that consists of a cooling pond and two cooling towers. The pond and towers are connected in a parallel arrangement to help dissipate thermal energy at expedited rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Joerg |first=Kirchhoff |date=1995|title=Optimized Combination of a Cooling Pond and Cooling Tower System for Condenser Cooling at a Steam Cycle Power Plant |url=https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/7801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33014">The '''Environmental Vulnerability Index''' ('''EVI''') is a [[measurement]] devised by the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC), the [[United Nations Environment Program]] and others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sopac.org/index.php/environmental-vulnerability-index Environmental Vulnerability Index] ''Secretariat of the Pacific Community''. Retrieved 4 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize the relative severity of various types of [[environmental issue]]s suffered by 243 enumerated individual [[nation]]s and other geographies (such as Antarctica). The results of the EVI are used to focus on planned solutions to negative pressures on the environment, whilst promoting sustainability.

== Development == 
The beginning stages of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) were developed to be appropriate for [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDs), this theoretical idea at the time was presented by the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) on February 4, 1999.  The ideas and plans for The Environmental Vulnerability Index were worked on further with the creation of a (EVI) Think Tank that took place from September 7 – September 10, 1999 in Pacific Harbour, Fiji. Expanding the (EVI) to other SIDS was aided by a meeting of experts convened in Malta on November 29 – December 3, 1999 by (SOPAC) and the Foundation for International Studies (of the University of Malta’s Islands and Small States Institute) with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

During the second phase of the development, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) was tested in five different countries. A workshop was made to expand the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index to a demonstrative set of countries from around the world. The workshop was hosted by UNEP in Geneva, Switzerland on August 27-August 29, 2001.  Continuation of work and development on The Environmental Vulnerability Index, lead to a presentation of the first functional results with the Demonstration EVI.

== Calculation ==
To be able to calculate an Environmental Vulnerability Index it requires the compilation of relevant environmental vulnerability data for the 50 indicators. Once compiled then this data must be used to calculate each indicator. As the indicators are heterogeneous, include variables for which responses are numerical, qualitative and on different scales (linear, non-linear, or with different ranges) they are mapped onto a 1–7 vulnerability scale. Where data is not available, no value is given for the indicator and the denominator of the average adjusted down by one value. Where an indicator is considered 'non-applicable' in a country (such as volcanic eruptions in Tuvalu which has no volcanoes), the lowest vulnerability score of 1 is attributed to that indicator. The vulnerability scores for each indicator are then accumulated either into categories or sub-indices and the average calculated. An overall average of all indicators is calculated to generate the country EVI. The EVI is accumulated into three sub-indices: Hazards, Resistance, Damage

The 50 EVI indicators are also divided up in the issue categories for use as required: Climate change, Biodiversity, Water, Agriculture and fisheries, Human health aspects, Desertification, and Exposure to Natural Disasters.

The first modern public [[exhibition]] took place in [[London]] during 1756, when the recently established [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce]] held the first in a series of [[fine art]] exhibitions. Prizes were offered for improvements in the manufacture of [[tapestry]], [[carpets]] and [[porcelain]], and winners were chosen from a competition of submitted articles. The show was open to society members and their friends. The society was more concerned with quicker production and more efficient implements than with artistic expression. Awards were given to young students for such practical things as planting oak trees for the [[English navy]] and dyeing textiles. There were 130 paintings by 69 painters in the exhibition, including artists such as [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]], [[Richard Cosway]] and [[Louis-François Roubiliac]].&lt;ref name=RSA&gt;[http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline History Timeline] RSA {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201183144/http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Society was known as the "Premium Society" because they offered cash premiums to encourage inventors and artists in their work. Its ten fellows included [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Jonas Hanway]], [[William Hogarth]], [[Thomas Hollis (1720–1774)|Thomas Hollis]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[William Shipley]]. They met at first at a coffee house in [[Covent Garden]] in 1754. The first awards given by the society were for discovering cobalt, raising and curing madder, and shipping breadfruit, and they had an emphasis on improving farming techniques.

The exhibition was considered a success. Hundreds of people visited, and although the Society had decided not to charge an entrance fee, the artists were left with a balance of £100 from the sale of catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Trueman Wood, A History of the Royal Society of Arts, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1761]] there was a follow-up exhibition of [[farm equipment|agricultural]] and other [[machinery]] sponsored by the British Society of Arts, which offered prizes as well.&lt;ref name=RSA/&gt;

{{Sex and the law}}
{{Violence against women}}
'''Forced prostitution''', also known as '''involuntary prostitution''', is [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]] that takes place as a result of [[coercion]] by a third party. The terms "forced prostitution" or "enforced prostitution" appear in international and humanitarian conventions such as [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 7: [[Crime against humanity]]&lt;/ref&gt; but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. "Forced prostitution" refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on systematic rape |publisher=Unhchr.ch |date= |accessdate=7 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112211407/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced prostitution is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation.

==Legal situation==
'''Forced prostitution''' is illegal under [[customary law]] in all countries.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law|edition=2d|last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 978-1859417768 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from voluntary prostitution which may have a different legal status in different countries, which range from being fully illegal and [[punishable by death]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|title=Iran - Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to being legal and regulated as an occupation.

While the legality of adult prostitution varies between jurisdictions, the [[prostitution of children]] is illegal nearly everywhere in the world.

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]. This Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution, and also deals with other aspects of prostitution. It penalises the procurement and enticement to prostitution as well as the maintenance of [[brothels]].&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; As at December 2013, the Convention has only been ratified by 82 countries.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020434/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main reasons it has not been ratified by many countries is because it 'voluntary' is broadly defined in countries with a legal sex industry.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[the Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm|title=Greece|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/middleeast/24iht-m24-turkey-brothel.html|title=Turkey Cracks Down on Legal Brothels|first=Susanne|last=Güsten|date=23 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries some forms of prostitution and pimping are legal and regulated as professional occupations.

==Child prostitution==
{{Main| Child prostitution}}
Child prostitution is considered inherently non-consensual and exploitative, as children, because of their age, are not legally able to consent. In most countries child prostitution is illegal irrespective of the child reaching a lower statutory [[age of consent]].

State parties to the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] are required to prohibit child prostitution. The Protocol defines a child as any human being under the age of 18, "unless an earlier [[age of majority]] is recognized by a country's law". The Protocol entered into force on 18 January 2002,&lt;ref name=Protocol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|work=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of December 2013, 166 states are party to the Protocol and another 10 states have signed but not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol2/&gt;

The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999]] (Convention No 104) of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) provides that the ''use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution'' is one of the ''worst forms of [[child labor]]''. This [[Treaty|convention]], adopted in 1999, provides that countries that had ratified it must eliminate the practice urgently. It enjoys the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.

In the United States, the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] classifies any "commercial sex act [which] is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age" to be a "Severe Form of Trafficking in Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm|title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|publisher=US State Department|accessdate=17 February 2010|date=28 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, especially poorer countries, child prostitution remains a very serious problem, and numerous tourists from the [[Western World]] travel to these countries to engage in [[child sex tourism]]. [[Child prostitution in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[Child prostitution in Mexico|Mexico]] have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation |author=Emilio Godoy |publisher=IPS |date=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{Main|Human trafficking}}
{{Slavery}}
Human trafficking, especially of girls and women, often leads to forced prostitution and sexual slavery. According to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm|title=UN highlights human trafficking|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=11 January 2010|publisher=the [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of trafficked persons are Thailand, [[China]], [[Nigeria]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Following the first international conference on the prevention of trafficking of women in Paris in 1885 a series of initiatives to restrict the trade of women into the sex trade were initiated. Both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] have addressed the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Sex|last= Altman|first=Dennis |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |isbn= 9780226016054 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XC0QDlW3YFAC&amp;dq=forced+prostitution |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report estimates that globally, 79% of identified victims of human trafficking were trafficked for sexual exploitation, 18% for forced labor, and 3% for other forms of exploitation. In 2011, preliminary [[European Commission]] in September 2011 similarly estimated that among human-trafficking victims, 75% were trafficked for sexual exploitation and the rest for forced labor or other forms of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;''The EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, 2012–2016'', [[European Commission]] [[Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the illegal nature of prostitution and the different methodologies used in separating forced prostitution from voluntary prostitution, the extent of this phenomenon is difficult to estimate accurately. According to a 2008 report by the [[U.S. Department of State]]: "Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80% of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50% are minors, and the majority of transnational victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46606.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report, I. Introduction|accessdate=30 January 2010|date= 3 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[European Commission]] report found that from 2010 to 2013, a total of 30,146 people were registered as victims of human trafficking in the 28 [[member states of the European Union]]; of these, 69% were victims of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29660126 Trafficking harms 30,000 in EU - most in sex trade], BBC News (October 17, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Economist]]'' claimed that only a small proportion of prostitutes were explicitly trafficked against their will.&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3151258|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Pisani]] protested against the perceived hysteria around human trafficking preceding sport events like the Super Bowl or World Cup of Soccer.&lt;ref name="wisdomOfWhores-traffick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pisani|first1=Elizabeth|authorlink=Elizabeth Pisani|title=The Wisdom of Whores: Bureaucrats, Brothels and the Business of AIDS|pages=213–214|url=http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/|publisher=Granta Books|isbn=978-1-84708-076-9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the Palermo Protocol) is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the United Nations [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] and defines human trafficking as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf "United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime"], Annex II, Section I, Article 3 (pg. 42). Retrieved on 21 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, threat, coercion, or use of force is not necessary to constitute trafficking, the exploitation of an existing vulnerability{{snd}}such as economic vulnerability or sexual vulnerability{{snd}}is sufficient. [[Sigma Huda]], UN special reporter on trafficking in persons, observed that "For the most part, prostitution as actually practiced in the world usually does satisfy the elements of trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution and Human Trafficking: Tackling Demand &lt;!--The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill:A Briefing from CARE--&gt; |url=http://chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202011/http://www.chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_5.php|title="It's Not TV, Its Sexploitation" Protest Against Home Box Office|author=Norma Ramos|publisher=On the Issues Magazine|date=Summer 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Save the Children]] see explicit trafficking and prostitution as different issues: "The issue [human trafficking] however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se. From this standpoint then, trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808002851/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=8 August 2007 |title=Definition of Trafficking |publisher=Save the Children |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voluntary vs involuntary prostitution==
With regard to prostitution, three worldviews exist: ''abolitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a victim), ''regulation'' (where the prostitute is considered a worker) and ''prohibitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a criminal). Currently all these views are represented in some Western country.

For the proponents of the abolitionist view, prostitution is always a coercive practice, and the prostitute is seen as a victim. They argue that most prostitutes are forced into the practice, either directly, by [[pimps]] and [[human trafficking|traffickers]], indirectly through [[poverty]], [[drug addiction]] and other personal problems, or, as it has been argued in recent decades by [[radical feminists]] such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], merely by [[patriarchal]] social structures and power relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html|title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
William D. Angel finds that "most" prostitutes have been forced into the occupation through poverty, lack of education and employment possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Youth Rights |last= Angel |first= William D. |year= 1995 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location= |isbn= 9780792333210 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3kT3fTMoggIC&amp;vq=forced+prostitution&amp;dq=involuntary+prostitution |page=897}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Barry]] argues that there should be no distinction between "free" and "coerced", "voluntary" and "involuntary" prostitution, "since any form of prostitution is a human rights violation, an affront to womanhood that cannot be considered dignified labour".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sex Sector: The Economic and Social Bases of Prostitution in Southeast Asia |last= Lim |first= Lean |year= 1998 |publisher=International Labour Office |location= |isbn= 9789221095224 |page=14 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VFNKZbL1jWwC&amp;vq=barry&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
France's [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]] argues: "The concept of "free choice" of the prostitute is indeed relative, in a society where gender inequality is institutionalized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?article120|title=Prostitution : les Verts opposés à la réouverture des maisons closes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proponents of the abolitionist view hold that prostitution is a practice which ultimately leads to the mental, emotional and physical destruction of the women who engage in it, and, as such, it should be abolished.  As a result of such views on prostitution, [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; [[Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7806760.stm|title=New Norway law bans buying of sex|date=1 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafnretti.is/jafnretti/?D10cID=ReadNews&amp;ID=523|title=A new law makes purchase of sex illegal in Iceland|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have enacted laws which criminalize the clients of the prostitutes, but not the prostitutes themselves.

In contrast to the abolitionist view, those who are in favour of legalization do not consider the women who practice prostitution as victims, but as independent adult women who had made a choice which should be respected. Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the [[Prostitution Information Center]], from [[Amsterdam]],  holds that: "In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this ... Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves."&lt;ref name="allow"&gt;Allow ''Women to Sell Their Bodies to Earn a Living'', Monitor (Uganda), Apr. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to proponents of regulation, prostitution should be considered a legitimate activity,  which must be recognized and regulated, in order to protect the workers' rights and to prevent abuse. The prostitutes are treated as [[sex workers]] who enjoy benefits similar to other [[Job (role)|occupations]]. The [[World Charter for Prostitutes Rights]] (1985), drafted by the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]], calls for the decriminalisation of "all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"/&gt; Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the [[decriminalisation]] of [[prostitution]], equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay [[taxes]], travel and receive [[social benefits]] such as [[pension]]s.&lt;ref name="hiholv1i6"&gt;{{cite news|author=Amalia Cabezos|title=Hookers in the House of the Lord|publisher=Santa Monica Mirror|date=28 July – 4 August 1999|url=http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080820101422/http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of such views on prostitution, countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; and [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; have fully legalized prostitution.

==Legal discrimination==
Sexual [[discrimination]] happens to those who work both in [[sex work]] and forced prostitution. Historically, crimes involving [[violence against women]] and having to do with prostitution and sex work have been taken less seriously by the law. Although acts such as the [[Violence Against Women Act]] have been passed to take steps toward preventing such violence, there is still sexism rooted in the way that the legal system approaches these cases. Gender based violence is a serious form of discrimination that has slipped through many cracks in the legal system of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica. ''Equal Means Equal''. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have fallen short due to the fact that there is no constitutional protection for women against discrimination.

There is often no evidence, according to police, that when men are arrested for soliciting a prostitute that it is a gender based crime. However, there are large discrepancies between the arrests of prostitutes and the arrests of men caught in the act. While 70% of prostitution related arrests are of woman prostitutes, only 10% of related arrests are men/customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayswan.org/stats.html "PENet: Prostitution Issues: Statistics"]. ''www.bayswan.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless if the girl or woman is either underage or forced into the exchange, she is still often arrested and victim blamed instead of being offered resources. The men who are charged with engaging in these illegal acts with woman who are prostitutes are able to pay for the exchange and therefore are usually able to pay for their release while the woman may not be able to. This generates a cycle of violence against women, as the situation’s outcome favors the man. In one case, a nineteen-year-old woman in Oklahoma was charged with offering to engage in prostitution when the woman was known to have previously been a victim of human sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/dockets/GetCaseInformation.aspx?db=oklahoma&amp;number=CF-2015-2310&amp;cmid=3247403 "OSCN Case Details"]. ''www.oscn.net''. Retrieved 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She is an example of how the criminalization of prostitution often leads to women being arrested multiple times due to the fact that they are often punished or arrested even when the victim of a situation.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"/&gt; Young women and girls have a much higher likelihood of getting arrested for prostitution than boys in general, and woman victims of human trafficking often end up being arrested upon multiple occasions, being registered as a sex offender, and being institutionalized.The lack of rehabilitation given to women after experiences with human [[sex trafficking]] contributes to the cycles of arrests that most woman who engage in prostitution face.

The ERA or [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] that has not yet been ratified. It would guarantee that equal rights could not be denied under the law on account of sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ "ERA: Home"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; With this amendment in place, it would allow for sex workers and victims of human sex trafficking to have legal leverage when it comes to the discrepancies in how men and women (customers and prostitutes) are prosecuted. This is due to the fact that there would be legal grounds to argue the unequal legal treatment on account of sex, which is not currently outlawed by the U.S constitution. Although there are other acts and laws that protect against discrimination based on a variety of categories and identities, they are often not substantial enough, provide loopholes, and do not offer adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm#q10 "ERA: FAQ"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This connects to [[liberal feminism]] and the more individualistic approach that comes with this theory. Liberal feminists believe that there should be equality between the sexes and this should be gained through equal legal rights, equal education, and women having "greater self value as individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Wendell, Susan (1987). ''A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism''. Hypatia. pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory focuses on equality at a more individual level as supposed to rethinking legal systems themselves or systems of gender, just as the ERA works for the equality of sexes within an existing system.

In Mexico, many criminal organisations lure, and capture women and use them in brothels. Once the women become useless to the organisations, they are often killed. Often, the criminal organisations focus on poor, unemployed girls, and lure them via job offerings (regular jobs), done via billboards and posters, placed on the streets. In some cities, like [[Ciudad Juárez]], there is a high degree of corruption in all levels on the social ladder (police, courts, ...) which makes it more difficult to combat this criminal activity. Hotels where women are kept and which are known by the police are often also not raided/closed down by police. Nor are the job offerings actively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Delarosa Hickerson on corruption in Ciudad Juárez&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's such as [[Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C.]] are trying to fight back, often without much success.

The number and nature of comfort women servicing the Japanese military during World War II is still being actively debated, and the matter is still highly political in both Japan and the rest of the [[Far East|Far East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;According to journalist Satoshi Ikeuchi: "Even though the forcible recruitment of women was not systematically implemented, the (Japanese) government should acknowledge its moral responsibility if any single woman victimized by the private operators through fraud, exploitation, violence or other acts of intimidation comes forward to tell her story. The government should do so because the military gave consent to set up brothels for soldiers and had responsibility for overseeing them.»  «In this context, the issue of the so-called comfort women was invested with extreme importance as the epitome of Japanese sin from the viewpoint of some and became the focal point of contention, The excessive effort by leftists and liberals in politicizing this issue as one of the few means left to shake conservative dominance, by extending the notion of coercion to the extreme, resulted in alienating a large part of the nation. Their open intention to collude with rising tides of hostile nationalism in Korea and China also hardened the minds of many in Japan." 25 April 2007. Satoshi Ikeuchi, [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/commentary/20070425dy01.htm Overcoming postwar mind-set], Daily Yomuri Online, 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many military brothels were run by private agents and supervised by the Korean Police. Some Japanese historians, using the testimony of ex-comfort women, have argued that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] were either directly or indirectly involved in coercing, deceiving, luring, and sometimes kidnapping young women throughout Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Asian colonies and occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="denial"&gt;{{Harvnb|Onishi 2007-03-08|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In Southern [[India]] &amp; eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Slavery Society. [http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm Child Hierodulic Servitude in India and Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

==Content==
In ''Foundations of Geopolitics'', Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and [[Atlanticism]] to lose its influence in [[Eurasia]] and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book declares that "the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians" has not ended and Russia remains "the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American revolution]]". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed "on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of [[Atlanticism]], strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow [[Liberalism|liberal]] values to dominate us."&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

The book states that "the maximum task [of the future] is the '[[Finlandization]]' of all of Europe".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In Europe:
* [[Germany]] should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. [[Kaliningrad oblast]] could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term "Moscow–Berlin axis".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[France]] should be encouraged to form a "Franco–German bloc" with Germany. Both countries have a "firm anti-Atlanticist tradition".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* The [[United Kingdom]] should be cut off from Europe.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Finland]] should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the [[Republic of Karelia]] and northern Finland will be "donated to [[Murmansk Oblast]]".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Estonia]] should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] should be given a "special status" in the Eurasian-Russian sphere.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Poland]] should be granted a "special status" in the Eurasian sphere.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Romania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], "[[Republika Srpska|Serbian Bosnia]]" and [[Greece]] – "[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] collectivist East" – will unite with "Moscow the [[Third Rome]]" and reject the "rational-individualistic West".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Ukraine]] should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is [[cordon sanitaire]], which would be inadmissible.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In the Middle East and Central Asia:
* The book stresses the "continental Russian–Islamic alliance" which lies "at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy". The alliance is based on the "traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization".
* [[Iran]] is a key ally. The book uses the term "Moscow–Tehran axis".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Armenia]] has a special role: It will serve as a "strategic base," and it is necessary to create "the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Erevan-Teheran". Armenians "are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Azerbaijan]] could be "split up" or given to Iran.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] should be dismembered. [[Abkhazia]] and "United Ossetia" (which includes Georgia's [[South Ossetia]]) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* Russia needs to create "geopolitical shocks" within [[Turkey]]. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including "the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]])" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In Asia:
* [[China]], which represents a danger to Russia, "must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled".  Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking [[Tibet]]–[[Xinjiang]]–[[Mongolia]]–[[Manchuria]] as a security belt.&lt;ref name="HI01"/&gt; Russia should offer China help "in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia" as geopolitical compensation.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* Russia should manipulate [[Politics of Japan|Japanese politics]] by offering the [[Kuril Islands]] to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Mongolia]] should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia.&lt;ref name="dunlop"/&gt;

The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: "the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S."

In the United States:
* Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support [[Isolationism|isolationist]] tendencies in American politics".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

[[Hoover Institution]] senior fellow [[John B. Dunlop]] stated that "the impact of this intended 'Eurasianist' textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin period".&lt;ref name="HI01"/&gt;

Historian [[Timothy Snyder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that ''Foundations of Geopolitics'' is influenced by the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], a proponent of a conservative international order whose work influenced the [[Nazis]]. He also noted Dugin's key role in forwarding the ideologies of [[Eurasianism]] and [[National Bolshevism]].&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/|title=Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|date=20 March 2014|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was described by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' as "one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia during the entire post-Soviet era", and "more sober than Dugin’s previous books, better argued, and shorn of occult references, numerology, traditionalism and other eccentric metaphysics".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R. J.]], [[James Lovelock|Lovelock, J. E]], Andreae, M. O. and Warren, S. G. |title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate |journal=Nature |volume=326 |issue=6114 |pages=655–661 |date=1987 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6114/abs/326655a0.html |bibcode=1987Natur.326..655C |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[hypothesis]] specifically proposes that particular [[phytoplankton]] that produce [[dimethyl sulfide]] are responsive to variations in [[climate forcing]], and that these responses lead to a [[negative feedback|negative feedback loop]] that acts to stabilise the [[temperature]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]]. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an [[James Lovelock#The revenge of Gaia|extremely accelerated global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock J., NBC News.

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean [[salinity]] has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Introduction to Ocean Sciences|last=Segar|first=Douglas|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9857859-0-1|location=http://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean3Chap05.pdf|pages=Chapter 5 3rd Edition|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested&lt;ref name="Gorham19912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Eville|date=1 January 1991|title=Biogeochemistry: its origins and development|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00002942|journal=Biogeochemistry|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=13|issue=3|pages=199–239|doi=10.1007/BF00002942|issn=1573-515X|ref=harv|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that salinity may also be strongly influenced by [[seawater]] circulation through hot [[basalt]]ic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The [[Mediterranean Sea]] as being Gaia's kidney is found ([http://scimar.icm.csic.es/scimar/index.php/secId/6/IdArt/209/ here]) by Kenneth J. Hsue a correspondence author in 2001.  The "[[desiccation]]" of the Mediterranean is the evidence of a functioning kidney.  Earlier "kidney functions" were performed during the "[[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of the [[Cretaceous]] ([[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]]), [[Jurassic]] ([[Gulf of Mexico]]), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permo-Triassic]] ([[Europe]]), [[Devonian]] ([[Canada]]), [[Cambrian]]/[[Precambrian]] ([[Gondwana]]) saline giants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scimar.icm.csic.es/scimar/index.php/secId/6/IdArt/209/|title=Scientia Marina: List of Issues|last=http://www.webviva.com|first=Justino Martinez.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Lovelock originally speculated that concentrations of oxygen above about 25% would increase the frequency of wildfires and conflagration of forests.  Recent work on the findings of fire-caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock's contention. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

And if we could see this whole, as a whole, through a great period of time, we might perceive not only organs with coordinated functions, but possibly also that process of consumption as replacement which in biology we call metabolism, or growth. In such case we would have all the visible attributes of a living thing, which we do not realize to be such because it is too big, and its life processes too slow.| Aldo Leopold | ''Animate Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Stephan.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Gaia as seen through the atmosphere | date = 1972 | journal = [[Atmospheric Environment]] | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 579–580 | doi = 10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5 | ref = harv|bibcode = 1972AtmEn...6..579L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974,&lt;ref name="lovelock1974" /&gt; followed by a popularizing 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. An article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' of February 6, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). "The quest for Gaia". [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnV6UYEkU4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New Scientist], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as ''The Quest for Gaia'', began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

[[File:Lynn Margulis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Margulis]]]]

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James.

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gmp logo.png|thumb|Global Marshall Plan Initiative Logo]]
The '''Global Marshall Plan Initiative''' views itself as an integrative organizational platform for a "world in balance". Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and [[civil society]], the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair [[globalization]]. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance!

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy.

== Origins  ==
[[File:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|thumb|Al Gore - Author of "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"]]
The idea of a [[Global Marshall Plan]] was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist [[Al Gore]] in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical [[Marshall Plan]] after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for [[hope]], [[solidarity]] and [[peace]].

The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: [[Kofi Annan]], [[Al Gore]], [[Hans Küng]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, [[George Soros]], Lutz Wicke, [[Georg Winter (manager)|Georg Winter]] and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a Kerosin tax.

As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, [[poverty]] and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 [[civil society]] organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for [[world peace]], [[sustainability]] and [[justice]], and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation.

The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and [[sustainability]]. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal to develop the initiative as openly as possible and also to win over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the great possible support to the world to ensure that plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage.

In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further and eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled to be published in September 2004.

In the meantime, more and more members of the [[European Parliament]] and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative was also received very well internationally. The initiative has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities.

Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “[[Business development|bottom-up]]”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies.

== Self-understanding ==
Material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, wasted limited [[resources]] and expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to [[pollution]] will present mankind in the next 30 years with their biggest challenge yet.

Unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and [[population growth]] are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization, which has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of [[AIDS]] and looming population growth also accelerate this.

Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and lobbying.

Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach.

== Goals  ==
The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives:

* to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems
* to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a [[sustainable development]]
* to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world’s civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international [[terrorism]] and endangers global security
* for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race
* to create fair globalisation
* and to accomplish [[human rights]] and human dignity for everyone.

According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be:

* The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the worlds market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries.
* An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development.
* The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan.

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and [[infrastructure]] with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability.

== The logic of the plan ==
Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative:

[[Investments]], coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged.

According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy.

It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost [[Good Governance]]. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles.

Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support.

One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap.

== Key requirements for a world in balance ==
Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various [[NGO]]s and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative.

=== Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals ===
In September 2000 the [[United Nations]] (UN) came together at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final [[Millennium Declaration]], globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues.

In this declaration, the 192 [[UN member states]] committed themselves to the concrete [[Millennium Development Goals]], which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization.

The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly.

=== Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds ===
A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general.

The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing.

The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance [[development aid]] would be available.

In comparison:

The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years.
 
Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars.

These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable.

=== Fair taxation on the global value-added processes ===
As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds.

On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan.

Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global [[financial transactions tax]], the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of [[climate justice]] and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples:

==== Financial transactions tax ====
Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The [[financial transaction tax]] (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the [[European Union|EU]].

Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “[[collective intelligence]]” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the [[New Economy]], this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level.

A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year.

However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions.

==== Other considerations ====
In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an [[International Finance Facility]] and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed.

Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority.

=== Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds ===
A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing).

To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan.

The overcoming of global [[market fundamentalism]] and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme.

The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society.

The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states:

Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), such as organisational rights, [[gender equality]], prohibition of [[child labour]] etc.

Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
 
Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved.

Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects.

In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative.

Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights.

Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society.

Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include:

* Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels
* Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries
* Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption
* Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit
* and adequate funding

The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries.

A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources.

==== From development aid to development cooperation ====
The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests.

Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes.

==== Application of funds ====
Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy:

* The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened.
* The example of the already established financing organisation “[[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN’s own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan.
* Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy.
* An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition.
* Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers.
* In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased.

=== Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy ===
With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole.

== Next stages ==
Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative’s own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body.

As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences:

* To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas
* To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness
* To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together.
* To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects.
* To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development
* To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries.
* To the [[European Union]] as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations.
* To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative.
* To the [[G8]] to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots.

Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children’s initiative [[Plant-for-the-Planet]], which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly.

Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative’s website.

The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative.

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of the initiative include [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), [[Rita Süssmuth]], Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, [[Jakob von Uexküll]], Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, [[Sandra Maischberger]] (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, [[Franz Fischler]] (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), [[Vandana Shiva]] (India), [[Jane Goodall]] (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria.

The supporting organisations include the [[Club of Rome]], the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, [[AIESEC]] Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, [[VENRO]] (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria.

In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan.

An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website.

== On a local level ==
Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area.

The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the [[climate crisis]], global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy.

The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally.

'''Gutenberg College''' is a private, four-year [[Great Books]] college in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Founded in 1994, the school has 14 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.edu/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Gutenberg College|accessdate=Jan 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The college occupies a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] building designed in 1927 by [[Ellis F. Lawrence#Biography|Lawrence, Holford, Allyn and Bean]]. Originally the University of Oregon's [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity house, the building became [[Delta Zeta]] sorority in 1946 when Delta Tau Delta moved across the street. Then in 1985 McKenzie Study Center occupied the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Gutenberg College grew out of McKenzie Study Center (MSC), a Christian ministry that has existed in Eugene for over 25 years. MSC was founded in 1979 as a ministry to present a biblical worldview to [[University of Oregon]] (UO) students; it now serves not only UO students, but the surrounding community as well. In 1991, after examining prospective curricula and programs, the board of McKenzie Study Center decided a Great Books curriculum would best accomplish their goals of providing a unique and well rounded education. Gutenberg started in 1994 with four students and graduated its first class in 1998. Gutenberg has grown, but remains small, with an enrollment of about fifty students.

==Great Books program==
The [[Great Books]] approach is based on a  program developed in the mid-1900s at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Mortimer J. Adler|Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], and others. This alternative approach to education emphasizes less the vocational skills and specialization of most undergraduate degrees, seeking instead to produce individuals who are well-read, well-reasoned, articulate, and mature. Personal growth rather than vocational training is emphasized and accomplished through studying the most influential works of Western Civilization in every discipline: philosophy, math, science, theology, literature, and art.

==Curriculum==
The curriculum centers on the most influential primary texts of Western Civilization, which students study with "tutors" in round-table discussions. In addition, the curriculum includes the following: a weekly lecture, classes and practicums in science, art, math, foreign language and the reading of difficult texts ("microexegesis"). The curriculum is viewed through a [[Sola scriptura|biblical Christian]] perspective, though the staff and faculty is not associated with any one denomination. Gutenberg offers one degree: a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts.

Coursework includes the following: two years of [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]]; two years of [[German language|German]]; two years of math (ancient and modern); two years of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] ([[Great Books]] readings); two years of Great Conversation (more in-depth Great Books readings), four years of Microexegesis (practicums in reading difficult texts), and several classes and practicums in physics, biology, chemistry, and art.

All students read the same works over the four-year program. Readings progress through the Great Books chronologically and cycle through the history of Western Civilization twice in the four years of study.

To promote lively discussion, classes are kept small, usually five to twelve students. A small number of lectures and secondary sources supplement the classic curriculum. At the end of the first two years, students must pass a series of comprehensive exams in order to progress to the last two years. During the senior year, each student writes an extensive thesis dealing with an issue discussed by two classic authors.

Gutenberg's curriculum is demonstrative of [[educational perennialism]].

==Authorization and accreditation==
Gutenberg is a non-profit corporation authorized by the State of [[Oregon]] to offer and confer a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts.

On November 3, 2009, Gutenberg College was first awarded full accreditation status by the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS) Accreditation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.edu/about_gutenberg/accreditation.php|title=Gutenberg College Great Books.|website=www.gutenberg.edu|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRACS is an accrediting organization recognized by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].

On October 21, 2014, the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS) Accreditation Commission awarded Gutenberg College "Reaffirmation I" of its Accredited status as a Category II institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.edu/about_gutenberg/accreditation/|title=Gutenberg College Great Books.|website=gutenberg.edu|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This status is effective for a period of ten years.

==Students and student life==
Gutenberg's students come from a variety of religious and non-religious backgrounds. Their educational backgrounds also vary: many were homeschooled; others attended public or private schools. Gutenberg offers a housing option with a common meal program.

While at Gutenberg, students may take advantage of programs at the [[University of Oregon]], located a block from the Gutenberg campus. Gutenberg students have attended UO lectures and events, and they have participated in UO dance, drama, music, and art classes.

Gutenberg graduates have pursued a variety of careers, including teaching and the medical profession; and they have entered such graduate programs as law, journalism, liberal arts, and philosophy.

'''Helen Swift Neilson''' (1869 – 1945) was an American writer and art collector.

Neilson was the daughter of the meatpacking entrepreneur [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]]. She became the second wife of the British politician and writer [[Francis Neilson]], with whom she founded the weekly paper ''[[The Freeman]]'' in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3484154 In Memoriam: Helen Swift Neilson], [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]], Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jul., 1945), pp. 511-513, on Jstor&lt;/ref&gt;

She is perhaps best known for her book about her parents called ''My Father and My Mother''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/my-father-and-my-mother/oclc/2325376 My Father and My Mother], The Lakeside Press, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., Chicago, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;
Neilson died in [[Chicago]].

She bequeathed several notable paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]:

The '''Hong Kong International Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships''', or '''Hong Kong Convention''' is a mulitateral convention adopted in 2009, which has not entered into force. The conference that created the convention was attended by 63 countries, and overseen by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which is a specialist agency of the United Nations (U.N).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/|title=International Maritime Organization|work=imo.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention has been designed to try to improve the health and safety of current [[ship breaking]] practices. Ship breaking is considered to be "amongst the most dangerous of occupations, with unacceptably high levels of fatalities, injuries and work-related diseases"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110335/lang--en/index.htm|title=IShip-breaking: a hazardous work|work=ilo.org|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[ILO]] as large ships are often beached and then dismantled by hand by workers with very little [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE). This is most common in Asia, with India, Bangladesh, [[China]], and Pakistan holding the largest ship breaking yards.&lt;ref&gt;Mikelis, Nikos.http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23449/shiprecycling.pdf "A statistical overview of ship recycling", September 2007. Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong Convention recognised that [[ship recycling]] is the most environmentally sound way to dispose of a ship at the end of its life, as most of the ship's materials can be reused. However, it sees current methods as unacceptable. The work sees many injuries and fatalities to workers, as they lack the correct [[safety equipment]] to handle the large ship correctly as it is dismantled and most vessels contain a large amount of [[hazardous material]]s such as [[asbestos]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Tributyltin|TBT]], and [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]], which can also lead to highly life-threatening diseases such as [[mesothelioma]] and lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/mesothelioma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906150654/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/sites-types/mesothelioma |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory of Hazardous Materials==
The ''Inventory of Hazardous Materials'' has been designed to try to minimise the dangers of these hazards. The Convention defines a hazard as: “any material or substance which is liable to create hazards to [[human health]] and/or the [[Natural environment|environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

All vessels over 500 gross tonnes (GT) that are in commercial service (the convention does not apply to [[warship]]s or [[naval auxiliary]] or ships operating their whole life only in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly) will have to comply with the convention once it comes into force. Each party that does wish to comply must restrict the use of hazardous materials on all ships that fly the flag of that party.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf 'agenda item 8' Retrieved on 11 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

New ships must all carry an Inventory of Hazardous Materials. The inventory will list all 'hazardous materials' on board the vessel, including their amounts and locations. Existing ships must comply no later than five years after the convention comes into force, or prior to being recycled if this occurs before the five-year period. The inventory will remain with a vessel throughout its lifespan, being updated as all new installations enter the ship, as these may potentially contain hazards. The presence of the inventory will then ensure the safety of crew members during the vessel's working life, and also the safety of workers during the recycling process.

==Signature, Ratification and accession==
The convention was open for signature between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, and remained open for accession afterwards. It will enter into force two years after "15 states, representing 40% of the world merchant shipping by gross tonnage, and on average 3% of recycling tonnage for the previous 10 years, have either signed it without reservation as to [[ratification]], acceptance or approval, or have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Secretary General".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/Environment/mainframe.asp?topic_id=818 Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; None of these conditions was met as of 2017:

==Relation to EU instruments==
The EU Ship Recycling Regulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/|title=Ship recycling - Waste - Environment - European Commission|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; entered into force on 30 December 2013. Although this regulation closely follows the Hong Kong convention, there are important differences. The Regulation sets out a number of requirements for European ships, European ship owners, ship recycling facilities willing to recycle European ships, and the relevant competent authorities or administrations. It also requires the Commission to adopt a number of acts implementing the Regulation (in particular the European List of ship recycling facilities authorized to recycle ships flying the Union flag). For the Inventory of Hazardous Materials required by the EU regulation, there are additional substances listed as prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0118|title=EUR-Lex - 52012PC0118 - EN - EUR-Lex|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immunogenetics''' or '''immungenetics''' is the branch of [[medical genetics]] that explores the relationship between the [[immune system]] and [[genetics]].

Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, are complex genetic traits which result from defects in the immune system. Identification of genes defining the immune defects may identify new target genes for therapeutic approaches. Alternatively, genetic variations can also help to define the immunological pathway leading to disease.

==Origin==
Its origin is usually attributed to [[Edward Jenner]], who discovered in 1796 that [[cowpox]], or vaccinia, induced protection against human [[smallpox]].
It took two centuries before the [[World Health Organization]] announced in 1979 that smallpox had been [[eradication of smallpox|eradicated]].

The term immunogenetics is based on the two words [[immunology]] and [[genetics]], and is defined as "a sub-category of genetics focussing on the genetic basis of the immune reaction" according to MeSH.
Genetics (based on Greek γενεά ''geneá'' "descent" and γένεσις ''génesis'' "origin") is the science researching the transfer of characteristics from one generation to the next. The genes of an organism (strands of DNA) and the transfer of genes from the parent to the child generation of an organism in the scope of possible variations are the basis of genetics.

Immunology deals with the biological and biochemical basis for the body's defense against germs (such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and [[Mycosis|fungi]]), as well as against foreign agents such as biological toxins and environmental pollutants, and failures and malfunctions of these defence mechanisms. Apart from these external effects on the organism, there are also defence reactions regarding the body's own cells, e.g. in the scope of the bodily reactions on cancer and the lacking reaction of a body on healthy cells in the scope of an immune-mediated disease. Hence, immunology is a sub-category of [[biology]].

The term immunogenetics comprises all processes of an organism, which are, on the one hand, controlled and influenced by the genes of the organism, and are, on the other hand, significant with regard to the immunological defence reactions of the organism.

==History==

The medical history of [[immunology]] and the [[immune system]] dates back to the 19th century. However, the prevention and early defence of diseases was an essential task for all shamans, medicine men and early "doctors" during the entire human evolution. The first Nobel Prize in the field of immunogenetics was awarded to [[Baruj Benacerraf]], [[Jean Dausset]] and [[George Davis Snell]] in 1980 for discovering genetically determined cellular surface structures, which control immunological reactions.

==Current research fields==
In the last 20 years,{{When|date=September 2012}} research activities focussed on a large number of different questions in immunogenetics. Both the acceleration of and the decreasing costs for the sequencing of the genes have resulted in a more intensive research of both academic and commercial working groups. Current research topics particularly deal with forecasts on the course of diseases and therapy recommendations due to genetic dispositions and how these dispositions can be affected by agents (gene therapy).

A special focus is often laid on the forecast regarding and therapy of genetically based [[autoimmune disease]]s, which include all diseases caused by an extreme reaction of the immune system against the body's own tissue. By mistake, the immune system recognises the body's own tissue as a foreign object which is to be fought. This can result in serious inflammatory reactions which may permanently damage the respective organs. Autoimmune diseases, the outbreak and/or course of which can be visible in the individual genome of the organism, include [[multiple sclerosis]], [[diabetes type I]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. As for multiple sclerosis, an article in the journal ''Nature'' dated May 2010 (Baranzini et al.: Genome, epigenome and RNA sequences of [[monozygotic twin]]s discordant for multiple sclerosis. Nature 2010, 464; S. 1351-1356 – for link see below) showed that this autoimmune disease is not caused by a genetic variation but the course and the treatability are considerably influenced by genetic dispositions. This research was based on analysing three monovular pairs of twins, of which one twin has contracted multiple sclerosis whereas the other one has not.

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}

The World Education Forum (Dakar 2000) agreed to reach 6 goals by 2015:
* expand early childhood care and education
* improve access to complete, free schooling of good quality for all primary school-age children
* greatly increase learning opportunities for youth and adults
* improve adult literacy rates by 50%
* eliminate gender disparities in schooling
* improve all aspects of education quality. 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

* “Volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study” (Indicator 4.B.1)

* “By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States” (Target 4.C)

* “Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country” (Indicator 4.C.1)

According to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals” in 2018, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals (English)|first=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2015-12-01|title=Incheon declaration : education 2030 - towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/167341467987876458/Incheon-declaration-education-2030-towards-inclusive-and-equitable-quality-education-and-lifelong-learning-for-all|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success.

''See also'' [[Comparative education]]; and [[Liberalism]], [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], [[Power Transition Theory]], [[International Development]], as focus areas that provide insight into international phenomena relevant to "International Education."

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32317">'''International''' or '''global psychology''' is an emerging branch of [[psychology]] that focuses on the worldwide enterprise of psychology in terms of communication and networking, cross-cultural comparison, [[scholarship]], practice, and pedagogy (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term “multicultural” is more often used to refer to ethnic and other [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.

== Definitions and scope==
International psychology is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the [[world]] (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of [[Applied psychology|Applied Psychology]] (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the [[icpweb.org|International Council of Psychologists]] (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicología (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick &amp; Constantable, 2015; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016). 

In contrast, the term “global psychology” is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a  psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, [[gender role]]s and gender-typed behavior, [[childrearing]] practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, [[value system]]s, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007).

Cross-cultural psychology may be defined as the comparative study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures. It aims to measure the psychological phenomena across cultures and looks for patterns, generalizability, and culture-specific differentiation (Shiraev &amp; Levy, 2013). An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences among distinctly different groups.  Cross-cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) and how it affects individual human functioning. In this respect, cross-cultural psychology constitutes one important element of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate [[Science|field of study]] with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline.

[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] (1993) defines global as, “…pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide” (p.&amp;nbsp;1101) and international as, “Existing, occurring, or carried on between nations…Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations” (p.&amp;nbsp;1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the ''de facto'' use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals.

It should be added that international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology share the common goal of making psychology more universal and less ethnocentric in character. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all—or at least most—people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening "world consciouness" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, &amp; Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbook by Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017).

== Foci ==
Major foci of international psychology include:

* The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001).
* Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce [[HIV|HIV infections]] based on psychological research (Wessells &amp; Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis &amp; Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, &amp; Prince, 2014).
* Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, [[school psychology]], and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, &amp; Mendonça, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, &amp; Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, &amp; Trimble, 2015).
* International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA’s Division 52 – International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the [[Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995).
* Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, &amp; Karandashev, 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, &amp; Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016). 
* Rewriting the [[history of psychology]] from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016).
* Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of [[ethics]] (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012).
* Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].
*Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health.

==History==

Modern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in [[Paris]], included more than 200   participants from 20 countries (Sabourin &amp; Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in [[Europe]], it soon began to prosper in the [[United States]] as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after [[World War II]] although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s some in nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the [[American Psychological Association]] established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.

During the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists.  This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a [[Master's degree]] or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented [[Bachelor’s degree]] that incorporates a period of supervised practice enable one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and [[Southeast Asia]] and is increasingly visible in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]] (Ahmed &amp; Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], psychology is well developed in [[South Africa]], but less present though expanding in the other regions.  For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which  includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 [[countries]] located on all inhabited [[continents]]. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries.

In general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems (Leung &amp; Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, &amp; Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).

== Trends ==

Perhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of [[Psychological science|Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Latin America]] in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018).

Trends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms.

The number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met.  However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair &amp; Kağitçibaşi, 1995; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004).

Specialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the [[World Wide Web]] and the emergence and growth of specialized [[international organization]]s and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in [[Developing country|low-income countries]], it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries. 

Feminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings.

Finally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of [[indigenous psychology]] include Mexico, the Philippines, [[South Korea]], and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists.

== Professional regulations and ethical standards ==

Many countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. “With some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated” (Pettifor, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide ranging guidelines for a European [[Diploma]] in Psychology comparable to a Master’s level [[Higher education|university education]] of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well.

Countries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]]. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide.
Many national psychology associations have adopted a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] such as, for instance, APA’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]]. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA’s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.

== Conclusion ==

The scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post-industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to “indigenize” psychology (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and  [[Telecommunication|electronic communication]]. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.

'''Interpersonal communication''' is an exchange of information between two or more people.&lt;ref name="berger_iec_2008"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-1-4051-3199-5| pages = 3671–3682| editor = Wolfgang Donsbach| last = Berger| first = Charles R.| title = Interpersonal communication| encyclopedia = The International Encyclopedia of Communication| location = New York, New York| date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an area of study and research that seeks to understand how humans use verbal and nonverbal cues to accomplish a number of personal and relational goals.&lt;ref name="berger_iec_2008" /&gt; Generally, interpersonal communication research has contributed to at least six distinct categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adjust and adapt their [[verbal communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]] during [[face-to-face communication]], 2) the processes of message production, 3) how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) [[Interpersonal deception theory|deceptive communication]], 5) [[relational dialectics]], and 6) social interaction that is [[Computer-mediated communication|mediated by technology]].&lt;ref name="berger_joc_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x| issn = 1460-2466| volume = 55| issue = 3| pages = 415–447| last = Berger| first = Charles R.| title = Interpersonal communication: Theoretical perspectives, future prospects| journal = Journal of Communication| accessdate = 2017-11-04| date = 2005-09-01| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02680.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of scholars collectively identify with and use the term interpersonal communication to describe their own work. These scholars, however, also recognize that there is considerable variety in how they and their colleagues conceptually and operationally define this area of study. In some regards, the construct of interpersonal communication is like the phenomena it represents- that is, it is dynamic and changing. Thus, attempts to identify exactly what interpersonal communication is or is not are often frustrating and fall short of consensus.&lt;ref name="Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011"&gt;Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many who research and theorize about interpersonal communication do so from across many different research paradigms and theoretical traditions.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manning | first1 = J. | year = 2014 | title = A Constitutive Approach to Interpersonal Communication Studies | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10510974.2014.927294#abstract | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 432–440 | doi = 10.1080/10510974.2014.927294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are many definitions available, interpersonal communication is often defined as the communication that takes place between people who are interdependent and have some knowledge of each other. Interpersonal communication includes what takes place between a son and his father, an employer and an employee, two sisters, a teacher and a student, two lovers, two friends, and so on. Although largely dyadic in nature, interpersonal communication is often extended to include small intimate groups such as the family. Interpersonal communication can take place in face-to-face settings, as well as through media platforms, such as social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpersonal Messages|chapter=Foundations of interpersonal communication (from Part I: Preliminaries to Interpersonal Messages)|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205943608.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807092332/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205943608.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2015|deadurl=yes|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of interpersonal communication looks at a variety of elements that contribute to the interpersonal communication experience. Both quantitative/social scientific methods and qualitative methods are used to explore interpersonal communication. Additionally, a biological and physiological perspective on interpersonal communication is a growing field. Within the study of interpersonal communication, some of the concepts explored include the following: personality, knowledge structures and social interaction, language, nonverbal signals, emotion experience and expression, supportive communication, social networks and the life of relationships, influence, conflict, computer-mediated communication, interpersonal skills, interpersonal communication in the workplace, intercultural perspectives on interpersonal communication, escalation and de-escalation of romantic or platonic relationships, interpersonal communication and healthcare, family relationships, and communication across the life span.&lt;ref name="Knapp &amp; Daly, 2011"/&gt;

==Role==
The role of interpersonal communication has been studied as a mediator for mass media effects. Since Katz and introduced their ‘filter hypothesis’, maintaining that personal communication mediates the influence of mass communication on individual voters, many studies have repeated this logic when combining personal and mass communication in effect studies on election campaigns (Schmitt-Beck, 2003). Although some research exists that examines the activities of social networking and the potential effects, both positive and negative, on its users, there is a gap in the empirical literature. Social networking relies on technology and is conducted over specific devices with no presence of face-to-face interaction, which results in an inability to access interpersonal behavior and signals to facilitate communication. (Drussel, 2012) As many positive advances we’ve seen come from the latest web innovations, can it be said that there are negative ones as well? Interpersonal communication is defined as what one uses with both spoken and written words as the basis to form and maintain personal relationships with others (Heil 2010). As technological advancements are made, the residual impact of social networking on society's young generation is of valuable importance to researchers in the social work field. Left unattended, the lack of skills to effectively communicate and resolve conflicts in person may negatively affect behavior and impair the ability to develop and maintain relationships. (Drussel,2012)

Technological side effects may not always be apparent to the individual user and, combined with millions of other users, may have large-scale implications. Therefore, each participant has a dual role—as an individual who may be affected by the social environment and as a participant who is interacting with others and co-constructing the same environment (Greenfield &amp; Yan, 2006).  Berson, Berson and Ferron (2002) believe that benefits of online interaction included learning relational skills, expressing thoughts and feelings in a healthy way, and practicing critical thinking skills.  However, there are some problems with this because one important negative point of interpersonal communication through social network is that people who rely on social networking lose their ability to communicate with others face-to-face. On the other hand, positive and negative effects of using interpersonal communication vary and depends on individual point of view.  In which case, it makes it challenging to give this question a specific answer.

== Context ==
Context generally refers to the environmental factors that influence the outcomes of communication. This includes the time and place as well as the background of the participants.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"&gt;Corbin, C. White, D. (2008). "Interpersonal Communication: A Cultural Approach." Sydney, NS. Cape Breton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In any given environment/situation a conversation takes place in, many contexts may be interacting at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHugh Schuste|first1=Pamela|title=Communication for Nursing: How to Prevent Harmful Events and Promote Patient Safety|date=2010|publisher=F. A. Davis Company|location=USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=communication+context+includes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mNXXrV05tQ&amp;sig=ZYceN4YJIrV9KOetfyBr_5UdWSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uYw0VN6lNNH_yQSxsoKYBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20context%20includes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have an in-depth understanding of the interpersonal interaction, the retrospective context and the emergent context must be examined and considered.  The retrospective context is defined as everything that comes before a particular behavior that might help understand and interpret that behaviour. The emergent context is described as all events that come after the said behavior and which may also contribute to understanding the behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Mark L.|last2=Daly|first2=John A.|title=Handbook of interpersonal communication|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publ.|location=Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.]|isbn=0-7619-2160-5|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Context in regards to interpersonal communication refers to the establishment and control of formal and informal relationships.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ackerson | first1 = L. | last2 = Viswanath | first2 = K. | year = 2009 | title = The Social Context Of Interpersonal Communication And Health | url = | journal = Journal of Health Communication | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 517–517 | doi = 10.1080/10810730902806836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the focus has been on "[[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] communication" meaning face to face mutual ideas between two individuals in health communication research with a focus on the patient and the provider.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Additionally, interest in the role of families, and occasionally among other key roles in the health care system are all factors on the context of interpersonal communication. Context can include all aspects of social channels and situational milieu.

=== Situational milieu ===

Situational [[Social environment|milieu]] can be defined as the combination of the social and physical environments in which something takes place. For example, a classroom, a military conflict, a supermarket checkout, and a hospital would be considered situational milieus. Similarly, this includes the season, weather, current physical location and environment.

In order to understand the meaning of what is being communicated, context must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knapp |first1= M.L. |last2=Daly |first2=J.A. |last3=Albada |first3=K.F. |last4=Miller |first4=G.R. |title= Handbook of interpersonal communication |date=2002 |publisher= Sage Publ. |location= Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.] |isbn= 0-7619-2160-5 |pages=2–21|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hospital context, internal and external noise can have a profound effect on interpersonal communication.  External noise consists of influences around the recetion that distract from the communication itself.&lt;ref name="Adler, R.B. 2012"&gt;Adler, R.B., Rosenfeld, L.B., Proctor II, R.F., Winder, C. (2012). ocess of Interpersonal Communication''. Don Mills: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In hospitals, this can often include the sound made by medical equipment or conversations had by team members outside of patient's rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Costa |first1= G.L. |last2= Lacerda |first2= A.B. |last3= Marques |first3= J. |year= 2013 |title= Noise on the hospital setting: impact on nursing professionals' health |url= |journal= EFAC |volume= 15 |issue=3 |pages= 642–652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal noise is described as [[cognitive]] causes of interference in a communication transaction.&lt;ref name="Adler, R.B. 2012"/&gt; Internal noise in the hospital setting could be health care professionals' own thoughts distracting them from a present conversation with a client.

Channels of communication also contribute to the effectiveness of interpersonal communication. A communication channel can be defined as the medium through which a message is transmitted. There are two distinct types of communication channels: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous channels involve communica are present. Examples of synchronous channels include face-to-face co chats, and telephone conversations. Asynchronous communication can be sent and received at different points in time. Examples of this type of channel are text serve as reminders of what has been done and what needs to be done, which can prove to beneficial in a fast-paced health care setting. Some of the disadvantages associated with communication through asynchronous channels are that the sender does not know when the other person will receive the message. Mix-ups and errors can easily occur when clarification is not readily available. On the other hand, when an urgent situation arises, as they commonly do in a hospital environment, communication through synchronous channels is ideal. Benefits of synchronous communication include immediate message delivery, and fewer chances of misunderstandings and miscommunications. A disadvantages of synchronous communication is that it can be difficult to retain, recall, and organize the information that has been given in a verbal message. This is especially true when copious amounts of data has been communicated in a short amount of time. When used appropriately, synchronous and asynchronous communication channels are both efficient ways to communicate and are vital to the functioning of hospitals.&lt;ref name="Parker 2000 453–461"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Julie|last2=Coiera|first2=Enrico|date=2000|title=Improving Clinical Communication A View From Psychology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|publisher=American Medical Informatics Association|volume=7|issue=5 |pages=453–461|doi=10.1136/jamia.2000.0070453|pmc=79040|pmid=10984464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When mistakes occur in hospitals, more often than not, they are a result of communication problems rather than just errors in judgment or negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=T.L.|last2=Parrott|first2=R.|title=Handbook of interpersonal communication|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publ.|location=Thousand Oaks, Ca. [u.a.]|isbn=0-7619-2160-5|pages=680–725|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when there is a lack of understanding and cooperation, due to a breakdown in communication in the hospital milieu, it is the patient who suffers the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kron|first1=Thora|title=Communication in nursing|date=1972|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7216-5521-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is essential to cultivate an environment conducive to effective communication, through appropriate use of communication channels, as well as the elimination, when possible, of distracting internal and external noise.

=== Cultural and linguistic backgrounds ===

[[Linguistics]] is primarily the study of language that is divided into three broad aspects including the form of language, the meaning of language, and the context or function of language. The first aspect, form is based on the words and sounds of language and uses the words to make sentences that make sense. The second aspect, meaning, focuses on the meaning and significance of the words and sentences that human beings have put together. The third aspect, function, or context is based on recognizing the meaning of the words and sentences being said and using them to understand why a person is communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, L. Goodman, J.E. (2007). ''A Cultural Approach to Interpersonal Communication''. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] is a human made concept that helps to define the beliefs, values, attitudes, and customs of a group of people that have similarities to one another in relation to language and location that have helped the people to survive more throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Samovar, L.A. Porter, R.E. McDaniel, E.R. (2009). ''Communication Between Cultures''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two subcultures, which include high-culture and low-culture. [[High culture|High-culture]] is seen as the part of culture that includes a set of cultural aspects mainly focusing on the arts, such as music, drama and others. Those that are of higher esteem and can access these aspects mostly are a part of this. [[Low culture|Low-culture]] in contrast, has a massive audience and is a term more for popular culture.

Culture has a strong dependence on communication because of the help it provides in the process of exchanging information in the objective to transmit ideas, feelings, and specific situations present in the person's mind.&lt;ref name="Fleischer, S. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleischer | first1 = S. | last2 = Berg | first2 = A. | last3 = Zimmermann | first3 = M. | last4 = Wüste | first4 = K. | last5 = Behrens | first5 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Nurse-patient interaction and communication: A systematic literature review | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 339–353 | doi = 10.1007/s10389-008-0238-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture influences our thoughts, feelings and actions, and when communication is occurring there should be an awareness of this.&lt;ref&gt;Intercultural communication: A contextual approach (4th ed.). Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; This means the more different an individuals cultural background is, the more different their styles of communication will be.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; Therefore, the first step before communicating with individuals of other cultures is the importance of being aware of a persons background, ideas and beliefs before there is interpretation of their behaviours in relation to communication. It is stressed that there is an importance of cultural safety which is the recognition of social, economic and political positions of individuals before beginning communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourque Bearskin | first1 = R. L. | year = 2011 | title = A critical lens on culture in nursing practice | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 548–559 | doi = 10.1177/0969733011408048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 5 major elements related to culture that affect the communication process:&lt;ref name="Samovar, L. A. 2010"&gt;Samovar, L. A., Porter, R. E., &amp; McDaniel, E. R. (2010). Communication between cultures. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, c2010&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                                                                             [[File:Communication Diagram.png|thumb|This is a Communication Diagram showing the two different types of communication that can be done between cultures. It is then further broken down into how you appropriately communicate verbally or non verbally with individuals of different cultures.]]

#[[Cultural history]]
#[[Religion]]
#[[Value (personal and cultural)]]
#[[Social organization]]
#[[Language]]

After the initial understanding of culture then communication takes place. Communication between cultures can be done through [[Verbal communication]] or [[Nonverbal communication]] with a sender and a receiver present. There is emphasis on acknowledgement and understanding of values, beliefs, emotions and behaviours of culturally competent individuals so you are able to adapt and decode the message and respond appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. S. | year = 2014 | title = Reaching for cultural competence | url = | journal = Plastic Surgical Nursing | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 120–126 | doi = 10.1097/PSN.0000000000000059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influences in Verbal Communication'''

Culture has influenced [[Verbal communication]] in a variety of ways. [[Linguistics]] is a large factor in relation to this because different cultures have different language barriers.&lt;ref name="Muñoz, C. C. 2005"&gt;Muñoz, C. C., &amp; Luckmann, J. (2005). Transcultural communication in nursing. Clifton Park, NY : Thomson/Delmar Learning, c2005&lt;/ref&gt; When communicating verbally with individuals of different cultures it is important to respond appropriately and withhold any judgment.  If there is a [[language barrier]] between the sender and receiver attempt to seek clarification, do not try not to interpret the meanings of the message.&lt;ref name="Muñoz, C. C. 2005"/&gt; There must be sensitivity present for individuals who are expressing opinions on culture and language. We live in a multicultural time, and this plays an important factor in considering that each individual has their own languages, beliefs and values that are allowed to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; When a verbal response is cultivated, it must be sensitive to another individuals culture.&lt;ref&gt;Neuliep, J. (2009). Intercultural communication: A contextual approach (4th ed.). Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Influences in Nonverbal Communication'''

Culture has an influence on our [[Nonverbal communication]] in a variety of different factors. For example, in some cultures eye contact is not essential, therefore those who do use eye contact may find it hard to talk or listen to someone who is not looking at them.&lt;ref name="Corbin, C. White 2008"/&gt; Another example is touching as a form of greeting may be perceived as impolite to some cultures whereas it is seen as a norm to others.&lt;ref name="Samovar, L. A. 2010"/&gt; It is important to acknowledge these cultural differences, and be understanding of them so better non verbal communication can be established.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, C. C., &amp; Luckmann, J. (2005). Transcultural communication in nursing. Clifton Park, NY : Thomson/Delmar Learning, c2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is that culture has a strong process of dependence on communication in the professional field.&lt;ref name="Fleischer, S. 2009"/&gt; Therefore, communication constitutes an important part of the quality of care and predominantly influences client and resident satisfaction; it is a core element of care and is a fundamentally required skill. Still, language can be expressed in different aspects although the most common process is the verbal and nonverbal communication. Hence, body language does a key factor in the process to communicate and interact which other. For example, the nurse-patient relationship is primarily mediated by verbal and nonverbal communication, so both aspects need to be understood.

=== Developmental Progress (maturity) ===

[[File:Constituents of Communication.png|thumb|This pie chart shows that 80% of communication is non-verbal and 20% of communication is verbal. This demonstrates how important non-verbal communication is in infants.]]
[[File:Stages of Development in Interpersonal Communication.png|thumb|This pyramid demonstrates the relationship between interpersonal communication and the stages of development. The downward formation of the triangle represents how much language is developed during that growth stage. The greatest amount of development occurs in the stage of infancy. As the triangle gets smaller, the development occurs less frequently and in a lesser amount.]]
The development of communication throughout one's lifetime is crucial because it is required in almost every aspect of human life. Majority of [[language development]] happens during infancy and early childhood. It is very important that infants learn the principles of communication earlier on in their development. The following information can be used to adapt to the specific attributes in each level of development in order to effectively communicate with an individual of these ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Abigail Peterson|title=The Communication Game|date=1980|publisher=Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Products Company|location=United States of America|isbn=0-931562-05-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of communication and language development that happen in different stages of life include:

''0-1 Years of Age:''
:During the period of infancy, an [[infant]] mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly [[gestures]]) to effectively communicate with others. In the first period of a newborn's life crying is the only means of communication, which is used to demonstrate their needs and wants. Infants, 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Also, within the 1 to 5 month stage the newborn begins laughing. When the infants are 6-7 months old they begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example "mama" and "dada". These words are simply babbled by the infant, lacking meaning and significance. When the infant turns 12 months of age they start to put meaning behind those once babbled words and can start imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. [[Linguistics|Verbal]] communication begins to occur at the age of 10-12 months. It starts with the act of imitating adult language and slowly developing the words "mama" and "dada". They can also respond to simple commands. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning, this enables them to communicate without the use of language yet displays effectively what they are trying to convey to others. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ateah|first1=Christine A.|last2=Kyle|first2=Terri|last3=Scott|first3=Shannon D.|title=Canadian Essentials of Pediatric Nursing|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=China|isbn=978-1-60913-707-6|pages=82–84, 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Nonverbal communication]] begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to breakdown what adults and others are saying to them, they then use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own.&lt;ref name="Haslett &amp; Samter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haslett|first1=B|last2=Samter|first2=W|title=Children communicating: the first 5 years|date=1997|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants have a remarkable capacity to adjust their own behaviour in social interactions. Infant's readiness to communicate completely effects their language development. Variations in the amount of interaction between a mother and her child will effect certain aspects of the infant's language performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Abigail Peterson|title=The Communication Game|date=1980|publisher=Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Products Company|location=United States of America|isbn=0-931562-05-8|pages=1–18, 49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1-2 Years of Age:''
:Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. The parental role is a large influence on the development of communication in children. Adults are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation etiquette. The vocabulary of a 1-2 year old should consist of 50 words yet can hold up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crais|first1=Elizabeth|title=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|journal=Use of Gesture Development in Profiling Children's Prelinguistic Communication Skills.|date=February 2009|volume= 18|issue=1|pages=95–108|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5040224c-8845-40e1-9be4-3475ec28057f%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=38&amp;hid=4105|accessdate=28 September 2014|doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/07-0041)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''2-3 Years of Age:''
:Children ages 2-3 experience something known as the turn-taking style. In this stage, children communicate best in a turn-taking style as it brings cohesive interaction into their channel of communication and a conversational structure is in place, which makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. This also teaches them skills of patience, kindness, and respect early on as they learn from the direction of elders that one person is able to speak at a given time. This creates biological patterns for the child and creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines which shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"&gt;Haslett, B., &amp; Samter, W. (1997). Developing verbal communication. In Children communicating: The first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver because this is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child and taking ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"/&gt;

''3-5 Years of Age:''
:This age group can also be classified as the [[pre-school]] age group as children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent while connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. [[Stuttering]] can be an effect of newly acquired verbal communication for children when they are around the age of three and can generally result in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z).&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"&gt;Ateah, Christine A.; Kyle, Terri; Scott, Shannon D.

As they continue to develop their communication skills they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conti-Ramsden | first1 = Gina | year = 2012 | title = Jun 17). "Human Communication and Deafness" | url = | journal = Language development and assessment in the preschool period | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 384–401 | doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conversing with adults, this is the stage when most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of the conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and an understanding of the verbal and nonverbal cues that the child is now aware of and will avoid in the future. They learn skills like taking turns and ideas of when communication is acceptable. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response.

''5-10 Years of Age:''
:A lot of language development that happens during this time period takes place in a school setting. During the beginning of the school age years, children’s vocabulary expands through increases in reading. Increased exposure to reading also helps school-aged children learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. These changes improve their communication skills because the message of what they are trying to say will become clearer. They also begin to develop [[metalinguistic awareness]] which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. This ability helps them understand jokes and riddles because they can comprehend the differences in the words. Having the skills to read well is a gateway for learning new [[vernacular]] at a young age and having the confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental part socially and physiologically for the child.&lt;ref name="Strom, R. 1987 pp. 270-278"&gt;Strom, R., Bernard, H., &amp; Strom, S. (1987).

New York, NY: Human Sciences Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures.&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"/&gt; As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. This new form of message complexity shows growth in a child's interpersonal communication and how they interpret language of others.&lt;ref name="Haslett, B. 1997"/&gt;

''10-18 Years of Age:''
:By the age of 10, individuals can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During the end of this period the individual reaches maturity influencing their cognitive potential, affecting their communication. During this time, there are rises in the sophistication and effectiveness for communication skills. [[Adolescence|Adolescents]] go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development which influences the way they communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Martine (March 2005). "AAC: Augmentative &amp; Alternative Communication". The Dual Challenges of Aided Communication and Adolescence. Vol. 21 (1): 67-79. Retrieved 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The individual has reached a higher level of education which has increased their vocabulary and grammar. However, adolescents tend to use [[Colloquialism|colloquial speech]] (slang) which can increase confusion and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name="Ateah, Christine A. 2008 pp. 82"/&gt; Also, an individual’s interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development.&lt;ref name="Strom, R. 1987 pp. 270-278"/&gt; The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage.

== Theories ==

===Uncertainty reduction theory===
{{Main|Uncertainty reduction theory}}
Uncertainty reduction theory comes from the sociopsychological perspective. It addresses the basic process of how we gain knowledge about other people. According to the theory, people have difficulty with uncertainty. They want to be able to predict behavior, and therefore, they are motivated to seek more information about people.&lt;ref name="Berger Calabrese 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Calabrese | first2 = R. J. | year = 1975 | title = Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 99–112 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory argues that strangers, upon meeting, go through certain steps and checkpoints in order to reduce uncertainty about each other and form an idea of whether one likes or dislikes the other. As we communicate, we are making plans to accomplish our goals.
At highly uncertain moments, we become more vigilant and rely more on data available in the situation. When we are less certain, we lose confidence in our own plans and make contingency plans. The theory also says that higher levels of uncertainty create distance between people and that non-verbal expressiveness tends to help reduce uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"&gt;Foss, K. &amp; Littlejohn, S. (2008). Theories of Human Communication, Ninth Edition. Belmont, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructs include level of uncertainty, nature of the relationship and ways to reduce uncertainty. Underlying assumptions include that an individual will cognitively process the existence of uncertainty and take steps to reduce it. The boundary conditions for this theory are that there must be some kind of outside social situation trigger and internal cognitive process.

According to the theory, we reduce uncertainty in three ways:

#Passive strategies: observing the person.
#Active strategies: asking others about the person or looking up info.
#Interactive strategies: asking questions, self-disclosure.

Uncertainty Reduction Theory is most applicable to the initial interaction context, and in response to this limited context, scholars have extended the uncertainty framework with theories that describe [[Anxiety/uncertainty management|uncertainty manangement]], more broadly, and [[Theory of Motivated Information Management|motivated information management]]. These subsequent theories give a broader conceptualization of how uncertainty operates in interpersonal communication as well as how uncertainty motivates individuals to seek information.

=== Social exchange theory ===
{{Main|Social exchange theory}}
[[Social exchange theory]] falls under the symbolic interaction perspective. The theory predicts, explains, and describes when and why people reveal certain information about themselves to others. The [[social exchange theory]] uses Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) theory of interdependence. This theory states that "relationships grow, develop, deteriorate, and dissolve as a consequence of an unfolding social-exchange process, which may be conceived as a bartering of rewards and costs both between the partners and between members of the partnership and others" (Huston &amp; Burgess, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;4). Social exchange theory argues the major force in interpersonal relationships is the satisfaction of both people's self-interest. Theorists say self-interest is not necessarily a bad thing and that it can actually enhance relationships.&lt;ref name="Homas 1958"&gt;{{cite journal
 | doi= 10.1086/222355
 | last= Homans | first=George C.
 | author-link=George C. Homans
 | year= 1958
 | title=Social Behavior as Exchange
 | journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]
 | volume= 63 | issue=6
 | pages=597–606
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, human interaction is like an economic transaction, in that you may seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. You will reveal information about yourself when the cost-rewards ratio is acceptable to you. As long as rewards continue to outweigh costs, a couple will become increasingly intimate by sharing more and more personal information. The constructs of this theory include discloser, relational expectations, and perceived rewards or costs in the relationship. Levinger (1965, 1976) discussed marital success as dependent on all the rewarding things within the relationship, such as emotional security and sexual fulfillment. He also argued that marriages either succeed or fail based on the barriers to leave the relationship, like financial hardships, and the presence of alternative attractions, like infidelity. Levinger stated that marriages will fail when the attractions of the partners lessen, the barriers to leave the spouse are weak, and the alternatives outside of the relationship are appealing.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"/&gt;

The underlying assumptions include that humans weigh out rewards versus costs when developing a relationship. The boundary conditions for this theory are that at least two people must be having some type of interaction.

Social exchange also ties in closely with social penetration theory.

=== Symbolic interaction ===
{{main|Symbolic interaction}}
Symbolic interaction comes from the sociocultural perspective in that it relies on the creation of shared meaning through interactions with others. This theory focuses on the ways in which people form meaning and structure in society through interactions. People are motivated to act based on the meanings they assign to people, things, and events.&lt;ref name="Mead 1934"&gt;Mead, G. H. (1934). Mind, self and society Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic interaction argues the world is made up of social objects that are named and have socially determined meanings. When people interact over time, they come to shared meaning for certain terms and actions and thus come to understand events in particular ways.
There are three main concepts in this theory: society, self, and mind.

;Society: Social acts (which create meaning) involve an initial gesture from one individual, a response to that gesture from another and a result.
;Self: Self-image comes from interaction with others based on others perceptions.&lt;br&gt;A person makes sense of the world and defines their "self" through social interactions. One ’s self is a significant object and like all social objects it is defined through social interactions with others.
;Mind: Your ability to use significant symbols to respond to yourself makes thinking possible. You define objects in terms of how you might react to them. Objects become what they are through our symbolic minding process.&lt;ref name="Foss Littlejohn 2008"/&gt;

Constructs for this theory include creation of meaning, social norms, human interactions, and signs and symbols. An underlying assumption for this theory is that meaning and social reality are shaped from interactions with others and that some kind of shared meaning is reached. The boundary conditions for this theory are there must be numerous people communicating and interacting and thus assigning meaning to situations or objects.

=== Relational dialectics theory ===
{{main|Relational dialectics}}

A dialectical approach to interpersonal communication was developed by scholars Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery. Their dialectical approach revolves around the notions of contradiction, change, praxis, and totality. Influenced by Hegel, Marx, and Bakhtin, the dialectical approach is informed by an epistemology that refers to a method of reasoning by which one searches for understanding through the tension of opposing arguments. Utilizing the dialectical approach, Baxter and Montgomery developed two types of dialectics that function in interpersonal relationships: internal and external. These include autonomy-connection, novelty-predictability, openness-closedness.

In order to understand relational dialectics theory, we must first understand specifically what encompasses the term ''discourse''. Therefore, discourses are "systems of meaning that are uttered whenever we make intelligible utterances aloud with others or in our heads when we hold internal conversations".&lt;ref name="Baxter Braithwaite 2008"/&gt; Now, taking the term ''discourse'' and coupling it with Relational Dialectics Theory, it is assumed that this theory "emerges from the interplay of competing discourses".&lt;ref name="Baxter Braithwaite 2008"&gt;Baxter, L., Braithwaite, D. (2008). Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory also poses the primary assumption that, "Dialogue is simultaneously unity and difference".&lt;ref name="Anderson Baxter Cissna 2004"&gt;Anderson, R., Baxter, L., Cissna, K., (2004). Dialogue: Theorizing difference in communication studies. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these assumptions insinuate the concept of creating meaning within ourselves and others when we communicate. However, it also shows how the meanings within our conversations may be interpreted, understood, and of course misunderstood. Hence, the creation and interpretations we find in our communicative messages may create strains in our communicative acts that can be termed as ‘dialectical tensions.’

So, if we assume the stance that all of our discourse, whether in external conversations or internally within ourselves, has competing properties, then we can take relational dialectics theory and look at what the competing discourses are in our conversations, and then analyze how this may have an effect on various aspects of our lives.
Numerous examples of this can be seen in the daily communicative acts we participate in. However, dialectical tensions within our discourses can most likely be seen in interpersonal communication due to the close nature of interpersonal relationships. The well known proverb "opposites attract, but birds of a feather flock together" exemplifies these dialectical tensions.&lt;ref name="Baxter Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L., Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating: Dialogues and dialectics. New York City: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The three relational dialectics====
In order to understand relational dialectics theory, one must also be aware of the assumption that there are three different types of relational dialectics. These consist of connectedness and separateness, certainty and uncertainty, and openness and closedness.

====Connectedness and separateness====
Most individuals naturally desire to have a close bond in the interpersonal relationships we are a part of. However, it is also assumed that no relationship can be enduring without the individuals involved within it also having their time alone to themselves. Individuals who are only defined by a specific relationship they are a part of can result in the loss of individual identity.

====Certainty and uncertainty====
Individuals desire a sense of assurance and predictability in the interpersonal relationships they are a part of. However, they also desire having a variety in their interactions that come from having spontaneity and mystery within their relationships as well. Much research has shown that relationships which become bland and ..monotonous are not desirable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

====Openness and closedness====
In close interpersonal relationships, individuals may often feel a pressure to reveal personal information. This assumption can be supported if one looks at the postulations within social penetration theory, which is another theory used often within the study of communication. This tension may also spawn a natural desire to keep an amount of personal privacy from other individuals. The struggle in this sense, illustrates the essence of relational dialectics.

=== Coordinated management of meaning ===
{{main|Coordinated management of meaning}}
Coordinated management of meaning is a theory assuming that two individuals engaging in an interaction are each constructing their own interpretation and perception behind what a conversation means. A core assumption within this theory includes the belief that all individuals interact based on rules that are expected to be followed while engaging in communication. "Individuals within any social situation first want to understand what is going on and apply rules to figure things out."&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"&gt;Littlejohn, S. (1996). Theories of human communication (Ed 5). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different types of rules that individuals can apply in any communicative situation. These include constitutive and regulative rules.

;Constitutive rules: "are essentially rules of meaning used by communicators to interpret or understand an event or message".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt;
;Regulative rules: "are essentially rules of action used to determine how to respond or behave".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt;

An example of this can be seen if one thinks of a hypothetical situation in which two individuals are engaging in conversation. If one individual sends a message to the other, the message receiver must then take that interaction and interpret what it means. Often, this can be done on an almost instantaneous level because the interpretation rules applied to the situation are immediate and simple. However, there are also times when one may have to search for an appropriate interpretation of the ‘rules’ within an interaction. This simply depends on each communicator's previous beliefs and perceptions within a given context and how they can apply these rules to the current communicative interaction.
Important to understand within the constructs of this theory is the fact that these "rules" of meaning "are always chosen within a context".&lt;ref name="Littlejohn 1996"/&gt; Furthermore, the context of a situation can be understood as a framework for interpreting specific events.

The authors of this theory believe that there are a number of different context an individual can refer to when interpreting a communicative event. These include the relationship context, the episode context, the self-concept context, and the archetype context.

;Relationship context: This context assumes that there are mutual expectations between individuals who are members of a group.
;Episode context: This context simply refers to a specific event in which the communicative act is taking place.
;Self-concept context: This context involves one's sense of self, or an individual's personal ‘definition’ of him/herself.
;Archetype context: This context is essentially one's image of what his or her belief consists of regarding general truths within communicative exchanges.

Furthermore, Pearce and Cronen believe that these specific contexts exist in a hierarchical fashion. This theory assumes that the bottom level of this hierarchy consists of the communicative act. Next, the hierarchy exists within the relationship context, then the episode context, followed by the self-concept context, and finally the archetype context.

=== Social penetration theory ===

{{main|Social penetration theory}}

Developed by Irwin Altman and Dallas Taylor, the social penetration theory was made to provide conceptual framework that describes the development in interpersonal relationships. This theory refers to the reciprocity of behaviors between two people who are in the process of developing a relationship. These behaviors can vary from verbal/nonverbal exchange, interpersonal perceptions, and one's use of the environment around them. The behaviors vary based on the different levels of intimacy that a relationship encounters.&lt;ref name= "Altman"&gt;Altman, Irwin; Taylor, Dalmas A. (1973). Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, p. 3, {{ISBN|978-0030766350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Onion Theory"'''

This theory is best known as the "onion theory". This analogy suggests that like an onion, personalities have "layers" that start from the outside (what the public sees) all the way to the core (one's private self). Often, when a relationship begins to develop, it is customary for the individuals within the relationship to undergo a process of [[self-disclosure]].&lt;ref name= "Baack"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baack | first1 = Donald | last2 = Fogliasso | first2 = Christine | last3 = Harris | first3 = James | year = 2000 | title = The Personal Impact of Ethical Decisions: A Social Penetration Theory | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 39–49 | doi=10.1023/a:1006016113319}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people divulge information about themselves, their "layers" begin to peel, and once those "layers" peel away they cannot go back; just like you can't put the layers back on an onion.&lt;ref name= "Griffin"&gt;Griffin, E. (2012). A First Look at Communication Theory (9th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. pp. 115-117, {{ISBN|978-0-07-353430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four different stages that social penetration theory encompasses. These stages include the orientation, exploratory affective exchange, affective exchange, and stable exchange.&lt;ref name= "Mongeau"&gt;Mongeau, P., and M. Henningsen. "Stage theories of relationship development." Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (2008): 363-375.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Orientation stage: At first, strangers exchange very little amounts of information and they are very cautious in their interactions. 
;Exploratory affective stage: Next, individuals become somewhat more friendly and relaxed with their communication styles.
;Affective exchange: In the third stage, there is a high amount of open communication between individuals and typically these relationships consist of close friends or even romantic or platonic partners.
;Stable stage: The final stage, simply consists of continued expressions of open and personal types of interaction.&lt;ref name= "Mongeau" /&gt;

If a person speeds through the stages and happens to share too much information too fast, the receiver may view that interaction as negative and a relationship between the two is less likely to form.

'''Example'''- Jenny just met Justin because they were sitting at the same table at a wedding. Within minutes of meeting one another, Justin engages in small talk with Jenny. Jenny decides to tell Justin all about her terrible ex-boyfriend and all of the misery he put her through. This is the kind of information you wait to share until stages three or four, not stage one. Due to the fact that Jenny told Justin much more than he wanted to know, he probably views her in a negative aspect and thinks she is crazy, which will most likely prevent any future relationship from happening.

Altman and Taylor believed the social exchange theory principles could accurately predict whether or not people will risk self-disclosure. The principles included, relational outcome, relational stability, and relational satisfaction. This theory assumes that the possible outcome is the stance that which the decision making process of how much information an individual chooses to self disclose is rooted by weighing out the costs and rewards that an individual may acquire when choosing to share personal information. Due to '''ethical egoism''', individuals try to maximize their pleasure and minimize their pain; acting from the motive of self-interest.&lt;ref name= "Ethical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/ethical_ego.html|title=Ethics - Ethical Egoism N.p. |date= 9 October 2009|accessdate=4 December 2012|website=philosophy.lander.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is more of a hassle to you than an asset, it is more likely that you will dispose of them as a friend because it is decreasing the amount of pleasure in your life.

An example of the social penetration theory can be seen when one thinks of a hypothetical situation such as meeting someone for the first time. The '''depth of penetration''' is the degree of intimacy a relationship has accomplished. When two individuals meet for the first time, it is the cultural expectation that only impersonal information will be exchanged. This could include information such as names, occupations, age of the conversation participants, as well as various other impersonal information. However, if both members participating in the dialogic exchange decide that they would like to continue or further the relationship, with the continuation of message exchanges, the more personal the information exchanged will become. Altman and Taylor defined these as the depth and breadth of self-disclosure. According to Griffin, the definition of '''depth''' is "the degree of disclosure in a specific area of an individuals life" and the definition of '''breadth''' is "the range of areas in an individual's life over which disclosure takes place."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Altman and Taylor discussed the process of four observations that are the reasons a relationship occurs:
;1. Peripheral items are exchanged more frequently and sooner than private information
;2. Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially in the early stages of relationship development
;3. Penetration is rapid at the start but slows down quickly as the tightly wrapped inner layers are reached
;4. Depenetration is a gradual process of layer-by-layer withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Altman" /&gt;

"'''Computer Mediated Social Penetration'''"

Also important to note, is the fact that due to current communicative exchanges involving a high amount of computer mediated contexts in which communication occurs, this area of communication should be addressed in regard to social penetration theory as well. Online communication seems to follow a different set of rules. Because much of online communication between people occurs on an anonymous level, individuals are allowed the freedom of foregoing the interpersonal ‘rules’ of self disclosure. Rather than slowly disclosing personal thoughts, emotions, and feelings to others, anonymous individuals online are able to disclose personal information immediately and without the consequence of having their identity revealed. Ledbetter notes that Facebook users self-disclose by posting personal information, pictures, hobbies, and messages. The study finds that the user's level of self-disclosure is directly related to the level of interdependence on others. This may result in negative psychological and relational outcomes as studies show that people are more likely to disclose more personal information than they would in face to face communication, primarily due to the heightened level of control within the context of the online communication medium. In other words, those with poor social skills may prefer the medium of Facebook to show others who they are because they have more control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ledbetter | first1 = Andrew M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2011 | title = Attitudes Toward Online Social Connection And Self-Disclosure As Predictors Of Facebook Communication And Relational Closeness | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 27–53 | doi=10.1177/0093650210365537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to an avoidance of face-to-face communication, which is undoubtedly harmful to interpersonal relationships. The reason that self disclosure is labeled as risky, is because, individuals often undergo a sense of uncertainty and susceptibility in revealing personal information that has the possibility of being judged in a negative way by the receiver. Hence, the reason that face-to-face communication must evolve in stages when an initial relationship develops.

===Relational patterns of interaction theory===

Relational patterns of interaction theory of the cybernetic tradition, studies how relationships are defined by peoples’ interactions during communication.&lt;ref name="Watzlawick Beavin Jackson 1967"&gt;Watzlawick, P., Beavin, J., &amp; Jackson, D. (1967). Pragmatics of Human Communication: A Study of Interactional Patterns, Pathologies, and Paradoxes (pp. 120 – 121). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Bateson, Paul Watzlawick, et al. laid the groundwork for this theory and went on to become known as the [[Palo Alto Group]]. Their theory became the foundation from which scholars in the field of communication approached the study of relationships.

====Ubiquitous communication====
The Palo Alto Group maintains that a person's presence alone results in them, consciously or not, expressing things about themselves and their relationships with others (i.e., communicating).&lt;ref name="Beavin 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beavin | first1 = J | year = 1990 | title = Behaving and communicating: a reply to Motley | url = | journal = Western Journal of Speech Communication | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 593–602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person cannot avoid interacting, and even if they do, their avoidance may be read as a statement by others. This ubiquitous interaction leads to the establishment of "expectations" and "patterns" which are used to determine and explain relationship types.

====Expectations====
Individuals enter communication with others having established expectations for their own behavior as well as the behavior of those they are communicating with. These expectations are either reinforced during the interaction, or new expectations are established which will be used in future interactions. These new expectations are created by new patterns of interaction, established expectations are a result of established patterns of interaction.

====Patterns of interaction====
Established patterns of interaction are created when a trend occurs regarding how two people interact with each other. There are two patterns of particular importance to the theory which form two kinds of relationships.

===== Symmetrical relationships =====
These relationships are established when the pattern of interaction is defined by two people responding to one and other in the same way. This is a common pattern of interaction within power struggles.

===== Complementary relationships =====
These relationships are established when the pattern of interaction is defined by two people responding to one and other in opposing ways. An example of such a relationship would be when one person is argumentative while the other is quiet.

====Relational control====
Relational control refers to who, within a relationship, is in control of it. The pattern of behavior between partners over time, not any individual's behavior, defines the control within a relationship. Patterns of behavior involve individuals’ responses to others’ assertions.

There are three kinds of responses:
* One-down responses are submissive to, or accepting of, another's assertions.
* One-up responses are in opposition to, or counter, another's assertions.
* One-across responses are neutral in nature.

Seth Weiss and Marian Houser add to relational control in a teacher/student context. "Students communicating with instructors for relational purposes hope to develop or maintain a personal relationship; functional reasons aim to seek more information presented and discussed by instructors; students communicating to explain a lack of responsibility utilize an excuse-making motive; participatory motives demonstrate understanding and interest in the class or course material; and students communicating for sycophantic purposes hope to make a favorable impression on their instructor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Seth|author2=Marian Houser|title=Student Communication Motives and Interpersonal Attraction Toward Instructor|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=August 2007|volume=24|series=3|pages=215–224|doi=10.1080/08824090701439091}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complementary exchanges====
A complementary exchange occurs when a partner asserts a one-up message which the other partner responds to with a one-down response. When complementary exchanges are frequently occurring within a relationship, and the parties at each end of the exchange tend to remain uniform, it is a good indication of a complementary relationship existing.

====Symmetrical exchanges====
Symmetrical exchanges occur when one partner's assertion is countered with a reflective response. So, when a one-up assertion is met with a one-up response, or when a one-down assertions is met with a one-down response, a symmetrical exchange occurs. When symmetrical exchanges are frequently occurring within a relationship, it is a good indication of a symmetrical relationship existing.

=== Theory of intertype relationships ===

{{main|Socionics}}

[[Socionics]] has proposed a theory of intertype relationships between psychological types based on a modified version of [[C.G. Jung]]'s theory of [[psychological types]]. Communication between types is described using the concept of [[information metabolism]] proposed by [[Antoni Kępiński]]. Socionics allocates 16 types of the relations — from most attractive and comfortable up to disputed. The understanding of a nature of these relations helps to solve a number of problems of the interpersonal relations, including aspects of psychological and sexual compatibility. The researches of married couples by [[Alexander Bukalov|Aleksandr Bukalov]] et al.,  have shown that the family relations submit to the laws, which are opened by socionics. The study of socionic type allocation in casually selected married couples confirmed the main rules of the theory of intertype relations in socionics.&lt;ref&gt;Bukalov A.V., Karpenko O.B., Chykyrysova G.V.

=== Identity management theory ===

{{main|Identity management theory}}

Falling under the socio-cultural tradition and developed by Tadasu Todd Imahori and William R. Cupach, identity-management theory explains the establishment, development, and maintenance of identities within relationships, as well as changes which occur to identities due to relationships.&lt;ref name="Imahori Cupach 1993"&gt;Imahori, T. &amp; Cupach, W. (1993). Identity management theory: communication competence in intercultural episodes and relationships. In Wiseman, R. L. &amp; Koester, J., (Eds.), Intercultural Communication Competence (pp. 112 – 31). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Establishing identities====
People establish their identities (or faces), and their partners, through a process referred to as "facework".&lt;ref name="Domenici Littlejohn 2006"&gt;Domenici, K. &amp; Littlejohn, W. (2006). Facework: Bridging Theory and Practice. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone has a desired identity which they’re constantly working towards establishing. This desired identity can be both threatened and supported by attempting to negotiate a relational identity (the identity one shares with their partner). So, our desired identity is directly influenced by our relationships, and our relational identity by our desired individual identity.

====Cultural influence====
Identity-management pays significant attention to intercultural relationships and how they affect the relational and individual identities of those involved. How partners of different cultures negotiate with each other, in an effort to satisfy desires for adequate autonomous identities and relational identities, is important to identity-management theory. People take different approaches to coping with this problem of cultural influence.

====Tensions within intercultural relationships====
Identity freezing occurs when one partner feels like they’re being stereotyped and not recognized as a complex individual. This tends to occur early on in relationships, prior to partners becoming well acquainted with each other, and threatens individuals’ identities. Showing support for oneself, indicating positive aspects of one's cultural identity, and having a good sense of humor are examples of coping mechanisms used by people who feel their identities are being frozen. It is also not uncommon for people in such positions to react negatively, and cope by stereotyping their partner, or totally avoiding the tension.

When tension is due to a partner feeling that their cultural identity is being ignored, it is referred to as a nonsupport problem. This is a threat to one's face, and individuals often cope with it in the same ways people cope with identity freezing.

Self-other faceground, giving in, alternating in their support of each identity, and also by avoiding the issue completely.

====Relational stages of identity management====
Identity management is an ongoing process which Imahori and Cupach define as having three relational stages.&lt;ref name="Imahori Cupach 1993"/&gt; Typically, each stage is dealt with differently by couples.

The trial stage occurs at the beginning of an intercultural relationship when partners are beginning to explore their cultural differences. During this stage, each partner is attempting to determine what cultural identities they want for the relationship. At this stage, cultural differences are significant barriers to the relationship and it is critical for partners to avoid identity freezing and nonsupport. During this stage, individuals are more willing to risk face threats to establish a balance necessary for the relationship.

The enmeshment stage occurs when a relational identity emerges with established common cultural features. During this stage, the couple becomes more comfortable with their collective identity and the relationship in general.

The renegotiation stage sees couples working through identity issues and drawing on their past relational history while doing so. A strong relational identity has been established by this stage and couples have mastered dealing with cultural differences. It is at this stage that cultural difference become part of the relationships and not a tension within them.

=== Communication privacy management theory ===
{{main|Communication privacy management theory}}
Of the socio-cultural tradition, communication privacy management theory is concerned with how people negotiate openness and privacy in concern to communicated information. This theory focuses on how people in relationships manage boundaries which separate the public from the private.&lt;ref name="Petronio 2002"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany: SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boundaries====
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever changing, and allow certain parts of the public, access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. This sharing occurs only when the individual has weighed their need to share the information against their need to protect themselves. This risk assessment is used by couples when evaluating their relationship boundaries. The disclosure of private information to a partner may result in greater intimacy, but it may also result in the discloser becoming more vulnerable.

====Co-ownership of information====
When someone chooses to reveal private information to another person, they are making that person a co-owner of the information. Co-ownership comes with rules, responsibilities, and rights which the discloser of the information and receiver of it negotiate. Examples of such rules would be: Can the information be disclosed? When can the information be disclosed? To whom can the information be disclosed? And how much of the information can be disclosed? The negotiation of these rules can be complex, the rules can be explicit as well as implicit, and they can be violated.

====Boundary turbulence====
What Petronio refers to as "boundary turbulence" occurs when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners, and when a co-owner of information deliberately violates the rules. This usually results in some kind of conflict, is not uncommon, and often results in one party becoming more apprehensive about future revelation of information to the violator.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
{{main|Cognitive dissonance}}
The theory of cognitive dissonance, part of the Cybernetic Tradition, explains how humans are consistency seekers and attempt to reduce their dissonance, or discomfort, in new situations.&lt;ref name="Festinger 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed in the 1950s by Leon Festinger.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang (2008). Cognitive Dissonance Theory. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' Donsbach, Wolfgang (ed). Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals encounter new information or new experiences, they categorize the information based on their preexisting attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs. If the new encounter does not coincide with their preexisting assumptions, then dissonance is likely to occur. When dissonance does occur, individuals are motivated to reduce the dissonance they experience by avoiding situations that would either cause the dissonance or increase the dissonance. For this reason, cognitive dissonance is considered a drive state that encourages motivation to achieve consonance and reduce dissonance.
An example of cognitive dissonance would be if someone holds the belief that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important, but they don't regularly work out or eat healthy. They may experience dissonance between their beliefs and their actions. If there is a significant amount of dissonance, they may be motivated to change their attitudes and work out more or eat healthier foods. They may also be inclined to avoid situations that will point out the fact that their attitudes and beliefs are inconsistent, such as avoiding the gym or not reading health reports.

====The selection process====
;Selective exposure: is a method for reducing dissonance that only seeking information that is consonant with one's current beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective attention: is a method for reducing dissonance by only paying attention to particular information or parts of information that is consonant with current beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective interpretation: is a method for reducing dissonance by interpreting ambiguous information so that it seems consistent with one's beliefs, thoughts, or actions.
;Selective retention: when an individual only remembers information that is consistent with their current beliefs.

====Types of cognitive relationships====
According to cognitive dissonance theory, there are three types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant relationships. Consonant relationships are when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant relationships are when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant relationships are when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.

===Attribution theory===
{{main|Attribution theory}}
Attribution theory is part of the sociopsychological tradition and explains how individuals go through a process that makes inferences about observed behavior. Attribution theory assumes that we make attributions, or social judgments, as a way to clarify or predict behavior. Attribution theory assumes that we are sense-making creatures and that we draw conclusions of the actions that we observe.

====Steps to the attribution process====

#The first step of the attribution process is to observe the behavior or action.
#The second step is to make judgments of interactions and the intention of that particular action.
#The last step of the attribution process is making the attribution which will be either internal, where the cause is related to the person, or external, where the cause of the action is circumstantial.

An example of this process is when a student fails a test, an observer may choose to attribute that action to 'internal' causes, such as insufficient study, laziness, or have a poor work ethic. The action might also be attributed to 'external' factors such as the difficulty of the test, or real-world stressors that led to distraction.

We also make attributions of our own behavior. Using this same example, if it were you who received a failing test score you might either make an internal attribution, such as "I just can’t understand this material", or you could make an external attribution, such as "this test was just too difficult."

====Fundamental attribution error====
As we make attributions, we may fall victim to the fundamental attribution error which is when we overemphasize internal attributions for others and underestimate external attributions.

====Actor-observer bias====
Similar to the fundamental attribution error, we may overestimate external attributions for our own behavior and underestimate internal attributions.

=== Expectancy violations theory ===
{{main|Expectancy violations theory}}
Expectancy violations theory is part of the sociopsychological tradition, and explains the relationship between non-verbal message production and the interpretations people hold for those non-verbal behaviors. Individuals hold certain expectations for non-verbal behavior that is based on the social norms, past experience and situational aspects of that behavior. When expectations are either met or violated, we make assumptions of the behavior and judge them to be positive or negative.

====Arousal====
When a deviation of expectations occurs, there is an increased interest in the situation, also known as arousal. There are two types of arousal:
;Cognitive arousal: our mental awareness of expectancy deviations
;Physical arousal: challenges our body faces as a result of expectancy deviations.

====Reward valence====
When an expectation is not met, we hold particular perceptions as to whether or not that violation is considered rewarding. How an individual evaluates the interaction will determine how they view the positive or negative impact of the violation.

====Proxemics====
The study of proxemics was originated by Edward T. Hall. The study of proxemics focuses on the use of space to communicate. According to Edward T. Hall's Theory of Personal Space, there are four spaces in which we situate our bodies to communicate.

;Intimate distance: 0&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;inches. This is often reserved for intimate relationships with significant others. It is also reserved for the parent-child relationship (hugging, cuddling, kisses, etc.)
;Personal distance: 38&amp;nbsp;inches &amp;ndash; 64&amp;nbsp;feet. This is often reserved for close friends and acquaintances, such as significant others and close friends. For instance, sitting close to a friend or family member on the couch.
;Social distance: 54&amp;ndash;82&amp;nbsp;feet. This is often reserved for professional situations, such as interviews and meetings.
;Public distance: 32&amp;nbsp;feet or more. This is often reserved for public spaces, such as waiting in an airport, sitting in a waiting room at a doctor's office, or choosing a seat in the movie theater.

====Dyadic communication and Relationships====
Dyadic communication is the part of a relationship that calls for "something to happen". Partners will either talk or argue with one another during this point of a relationship to bring about change. When partners talk or argue with one another, the relationship may still survive at this point.

Bochner (2000) stresses inherent dialectic in interpersonal communication as the key to healthy marital dyads. He proposes that people in intimate relationships are looking to find an equilibrium point between needing to be open with their partner and needing to protect their partner from the consequences of this openness. Therefore, the communication in romantic, long-term relationships can be viewed as a balance between hiding and revealing. Taking this theory even further, communication within marriages can be viewed as a continuing refinement and elimination of conversational material. The partners of the marriage will still have things to discuss, but as their relationship and communication grows, they can decide when to not speak about an issue, because in complex relationships like marriage, anything can become an issue.

;Conflict resolution
Sillars (1380) and Roloff (1876) expressed that conflict resolution strategies can be categorized as pro-social or anti-social in nature. When an individual is presented with an interpersonal conflict, they can decide how they want to deal with it. They can avoid (anti-social), compete (anti-social), or cooperate (pro-social). It has been learned that one who avoids conflict is less capable of solving problems because they are more constricted. Avoidance has negative effects on dyads.

;The Couples Coping Enhancement Training (CCET)
This program is based on stress, coping, and research on dyads (Bodenmann, 1997a; 2000b). The focus is on individual and dyadic coping to help promote satisfaction within marriage and to help reduce distress within marriages. CCET states three important factors for dyads being successful when they enter counseling programs. Firstly, the dyad's ability to cope with daily stress is a main factor in determining the success or failure of their relationship. Couples need to be educated about ways to manage daily stress so that this stress is not placed on their partner or on their relationship. Secondly, couples who enter counseling to help their relationship must stay in counseling to continue to get reinforcement and encourage about practicing their new methods of communication. Continued counseling will help the couple to maintain their new strategies. Lastly, couples should make use of technology within their counseling. They should use the Internet and seek help online in addition to their counseling program. Having technology that can help couples with immediate problems is a very useful thing.

;Parenting
Many theorists have studied how the relationship between the husband and wife greatly affects the relationship between the parent and child (Belsky, 1990; Parke &amp; Tinsley, 1987). There have been numerous studies done that show how difficult it is to maintain a positive and healthy parent-child relationship when the marriage between the parents is failing. "Spillover," emotional transmission from one family relationship to another, is a likely explanation as to why parents have trouble fostering a good relationship with their children when there are problems within their marriage (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, &amp; Wethington, 1989; Repetti, 1987).

New Parenthood and Marital Quality:

New parenthood is a time where there are many adjustments within a family and these adjustments can put a lot of stress on marital dyads. How a couple deals with first-time parenthood directly correlates to their marital satisfaction, amount of conflict within their marriage, and the perceptions of themselves (Glade, Bean, &amp; Vira, 2005). Studies show that transitioning into parenting leads to more marital conflicts and less marital satisfaction. When marital dyads have a child, their once dyadic dynamic relationships quickly changes to a triadic relationship, creating a shift in roles. New topics for discussion between the married couple, such as household labor, finances, and child care responsibilities, can lead to major conflicts. It is important for couples to identify ways that may help them maintain marital satisfaction while coping with becoming parents.

===Pedagogical communication===
{{Main|Pedagogical communication}}

Pedagogical communication is an action in which the body, being a part of a relational whole, performs a fundamental role. As such, instructional communication (pedagogical communication) is often conceptualized as a form of interpersonal communication. Various studies on the interaction between teacher and student confirms that there is a strong correlation between the teacher's nonverbal behavior (such as immediacy), as well as verbal behavior (such as out of class communication (OCC)) and the students' level of motivation and proficiency. Nonverbal communication serves as a vehicle for the teacher's affections, intentions, and attitudes towards students, and vice versa. For this reason, the concept of "immediacy" is often studied in pedagogical communication. Immediacy is the perception of physical, emotional, or psychological proximity created by positive communicative behaviors – in the pedagogical relationship, it refers specifically to the communication between teachers and students (Richmond, 2002 ; Sibii, 2010). Studies examining interpersonal communication in instructional communication are published in ''Communication Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rced20/current|title=Communication Education|work=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good communication between teachers and young students is thought to improve the test scores of the students. Some parents of students at The William T. Harris School were interviewed and stated that they can tell how good a teacher is just by watching them in the classroom setting. Observing how teachers talk to their students and how they promote communication between their students can lead to conclusions about how well these students will score on standardized tests. Parents of students at The William T. Harris School have admitted that they do not always trust the publicized rankings of teachers; however, they stated that there are strong similarities between their children's grades and their impressions of their children's teachers.

===Social networks===
{{Main|Social networks}}
According to Malcolm R. Parks (2011) in the SAGE Handbook of Interpersonal Communication, interest in social networks has increased over the past decade among scholars in a variety of disciplines. Networks of all kinds consist of nodes and links. The way these concepts are defined varies across disciplines. Interpersonal communication researchers define nodes as individuals and links are conceptualized as the content or frequency of their interaction or the overall strength of their relationship.

The value of network analysis resides in the identification of the larger patterns or structures created by the way network members are connected to one another. The structures both create and reflect a wide range of social phenomena. Interpersonal communication research has traditionally focused on the attributes of message or communicators, as well as attributes of the relationship between the communicators. Taking a network perspective, however, involves focusing on structures of connections among communicators. Rather describing individuals and their personalities, individuals are described in terms of their relative location within a larger social network structure.

===Hurt===
The topic of hurt in interpersonal relationships has received attention in the study of interpersonal communication. Important to the study of hurt is the concept of "devaluation". Devaluation means feeling unappreciated and unimportant. A person can feel devalued at the individual and relational level. At the individual level, individuals can feel devalued when someone insults their intelligence, appearance, personality, life decisions, etc. At the relational level, individuals can feel devalued when there is a perception that one's partner does not perceive the relationship to be close, important, or as valuable as one would like.

The concept of relational transgressions is also important in understanding hurt. Relational transgressions occur when people violate implicit or explicit relational rules. For instance, if someone believes that their romantic partner should be sexually faithful and emotionally faithful, loyal, and honest, then when someone violates one or more of these standards, they have committed a relational transgression.

Additionally, hurtful messages are communicative messages that inflict psychological pain. According to Vangelisti (1994), words "have the ability to hurt or harm in every bit as real away as physical objects. A few ill-spoken words (e.g. "You're worthless," "You'll never amount to anything," "I don't love you anymore") can strongly affect individuals, interactions, and relationships." (p. 53). Studies have shown that hurtful words and events have negative effects on the relationship. In friendships, studies have found that betrayal leads to less acceptance, trust, and respect, according to Davis and Todd (1985).

Infidelity is a form of hurt that can have particularly strong negative effects on relationships. According to a study by Afifi, Falnto, and Weiner (2001), the methods of discovery of infidelity include: 1) Discovering from a third party; 2) witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as walking in on your partner with someone else; 3) having the partner admit to infidelity after confronting them; 4) having the partner tell you on their own. People who discovered their partner's infidelity first hand were least likely to forgive their partner. Individuals were most likely to forgive their partners when they confessed on their own.

Infidelity can take place in the form of sexual and/or emotional infidelity. Sexual infidelity refers to "sexual activity with someone other than one's long-term partner" (Shackelford &amp; Buss, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1035). Several studies show that most individuals disapprove of sexual infidelity; however, several studies also show that sexual infidelity is quite common (Thompson, 1984). Some studies have found that 30%-40% of dating relationships and 40%-60% of marriages are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity (Guerrero, Spitzberg, &amp; Yoshimura, 2004). Men are more likely than women to have a sexual affair, regardless of whether they are dating or married or dating (Sprecher &amp; McKinney, 1993). In an older study by Blumenstein and Schwartz (1983), 82% of gay male couples reported having an affair, compared to about 28% of lesbian couples and 27% of heterosexual couples. This study is quite dated, so it may not hold true today.

Emotional infidelity refers to emotional involvement with another person, who leads one's partner to channel "emotional resources such as romantic love, time, and attention to someone else" (Shackelford &amp; Buss, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1035). There is less information available on emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity. Reasons for committing infidelity vary. Research on sexual infidelity suggests that dissatisfaction with a current relationship may be the leading cause (Sheppard, Nelson, &amp; Andreoli-Mathie, 1995). Other common causes include boredom, the need for excitement and variety, wanting to feel attractive, sexual incompatibility, and revenge (Fleischman et al., 2005).

Another important element of hurt and infidelity is jealousy. Jealousy involves a reaction to an imagined or actual threat. When people suspect or discover infidelity, jealousy is a common reaction. Jealousy is often the result of a relational transgressions, such as an affair. Jealousy is also seen as a transgression in itself when it is perceived by one's partner to be unwarranted. In interpersonal scholarship, there are numerous kinds of jealousy: romantic, platonic, sexual, friend, family, activity, and intimacy jealousy.

===Conflict===

Many interpersonal communication scholars have sought to define and understand interpersonal conflict. As a result, there are numerous definitions of conflict available. Although these varying perspectives highlight something unique about interpersonal conflict, they also cause some confusion. This has resulted in difficulty in establishing uniform methods of operationalization for those who use social scientific (quantitative) methods of analysis. This means that it is difficult to generalize findings across studies.

According to Barcki and Harwick (2004), who consolidated several definitions across the discipline, conflict can be defined as "a dynamic process that occurs between interdependent parties as they experience negative emotional reactions to perceived disagreements and interference with the attainment of their goals" (p.&amp;nbsp;234). With this definition, conflict has three properties:

#disagreement
#negative emotion
#interference

The disagreement property demonstrates the element of perception in conflict. The negative emotion component demonstrates the affect characteristic. The behavioral element demonstrates the interference characteristic of conflict. Within this definition, conflict can be focused on task or relational issues. Task issues involve events, plans, behaviors, etc. Relational conflict involves dispute over personal issues, attitudes, values, beliefs, behaviors, relationship status, etc.

===Technology and Interpersonal Communication Skills===

Technology has provided the opportunity for quick worldwide access, but individuals who heavily depend on it as their primary method of communication are hindering their own development of interpersonal communication skills (Johnson). Only seven percent of communication is written or verbal, whereas ninety-three percent is nonverbal (Tardanico). Nonverbal communication skills cannot be learned, nor be further developed if there is too much interaction through electronics because there is no way to see facial expressions, body language, or hear tone or inflection in the voice (Johnson). According to psychologists and communication experts, listening and comprehending conversations play a huge role in effective interpersonal communication skills (Robinson, Segal, and Smith). Communication experts suggest handling conflict face to face only because it lessens the potential for miscommunication (Wimer). Research has shown that when children interact too often on electronic devices the proper stimulation and development of the neurotransmitter pathways do not occur and so neuropathways are forced to change in order to adapt. Potential risks consist of inability to have profoundly personal relationships, unable to concentrate accurately, causes issues with self-esteem, or they might not be able to develop the much needed empathetic and sympathetic skillset (Johnson). Worldwide employer surveys indicate one in every five companies have chosen to not fill positions because the candidates do not have the much desired interpersonal communication skills, but most of them are very comfortable navigating social media websites (White).

The '''King's Manor''' is a Grade I [[listed building]] in [[York]], [[England]], and is part of the [[University of York]].

==History==
King's Manor was originally built to house the abbots of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]].&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=58182 |mname=King's Manor, York|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbot's house probably occupied the site since the eleventh century, but the earliest remains date from the fifteenth century.  When the abbey was dissolved in 1539, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] instructed that it be the seat of the [[Council of the North]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt; It performed this role until the Council was abolished in 1641.&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  From 1667 to 1688, it was the residence of the Governor of York. During the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the Governor, [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet]], remained loyal to the King, James II, but a party of armed men, led by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, captured the Manor and the City of York, and held them for [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. After 1688, the building was hired out to private tenants until the nineteenth century, when it was taken over and expanded by the Yorkshire School for the Blind.&lt;ref name=past/&gt; For a detailed description of the history and architecture of the building, perhaps the best source is that contained in the RCHME Inventory of the City of York, Volume IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/york/vol4/pp30-43|title=The King's Manor {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by University of York ==
On the departure of the Blind School in 1958, the Manor was acquired by York City Council, who leased it to the University in 1963.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;  The main University later moved to the Heslington Campus. From 1966, the principal academic department to use the Manor was the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IoAAS). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ip51.icomos.org/~fleblanc/projects/1971-1979_PC/p_pc_uk_york_course/p_pc_york_course_program.pdf|title=IoAAS courses description|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IoAAS was a leading UK provider of mid-career education for architects and related professionals, specialising latterly in architectural conservation studies. The main public room of the Manor is the Huntingdon Room, used for courses and meetings. As well as the IoAAS, there were several other Departments in the King’s Manor, the main ones being the Centre for Medieval Studies, a Language Teaching centre and the Design Unit (an architectural practice, but part of the IoAAS). The building also housed six University staff flats. The Dining Room provided an important place for the meeting of ‘town and gown’, especially in the early years of the University. Following the closure of the IoAAS, the main occupant became the [[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|Department of Archaeology]] (including the [[Archaeology Data Service]]), plus the Centre for Medieval Studies and the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;

'''Language and Communication Technologies''' ('''LCT'''; also known as '''''human language technologies''''' or '''''[[language technology]]''''' for short) is the scientific study of technologies that explore language and communication.  It is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the fields of [[computer science]], [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive science]].

==History==
One of the first problems to be studied in the 1950s, shortly after the invention of computers, was an LCT problem, namely the translation of human languages.  The large amounts of funding poured into [[machine translation]] testifies to the perceived importance of the field, right from the beginning.  It was also in this period that scholars started to develop theories of language and communication based on scientific methods. In the case of language, it was [[Noam Chomsky]] who refines the goal of linguistics as a quest for a formal description of language,&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, ''Syntactic Structures'', London: Mouton, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] provided a mathematical theory that linked communication with information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html A Mathematical Theory of Communication]. Cm.bell-labs.com (1998-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980131083455/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html|date=1998-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers and related technologies have provided a physical and conceptual framework within which scientific studies concerning the notion of communication within a computational framework could be pursued. Indeed, this framework has been fruitful on a number of levels. For a start, it has given birth to a new discipline, known as [[natural language processing]] (NLP), or [[computational linguistics]] (CL). This discipline studies, from a computational perspective, all levels of language from the production of speech to the meanings of texts and dialogues. And over the past 40 years, NLP has produced an impressive computational infrastructure of resources, techniques, and tools for analyzing sound structure ([[phonology]]), word structure ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), grammatical structure ([[syntax]]) and meaning structure ([[semantics]]). As well as being important for language-based applications, this computational infrastructure makes it possible to investigate the structure of human language and communication at a deeper scientific level than was ever previously possible.

Moreover, NLP fits in naturally with other branches of computer science, and in particular, with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage AITopics / NaturalLanguage]. Aaai.org. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731224551/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/NaturalLanguage|date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an AI perspective, language use is regarded as a manifestation of intelligent behaviour by an active agent. The emphasis in AI-based approaches to language and communication is on the computational infrastructure required to integrate linguistic performance into a general theory of intelligent agents that includes, for example, learning generalizations on the basis of particular experience, the ability to plan and reason about intentionally produced utterances, the design of utterances that will fulfill a particular set of goals. Such work tends to be highly interdisciplinary in nature, as it needs to draw on ideas from such fields as [[linguistics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[sociology]]. LCT draws on and incorporates knowledge and research from all these fields.

==Today==
Language and communication are so fundamental to human activity that it is not at all surprising to find that Language and Communication Technologies affect all major areas of society, including health, education, finance, commerce, and travel. Modern LCT is based on a dual tradition of symbols and statistics. This means that nowadays research on language requires access to large databases of information about words and their properties, to large scale computational grammars, to computational tools for working with all levels of language, and to efficient inference systems for performing reasoning. By working computationally it is possible to get to grips with the deeper structure of natural languages, and in particular, to model the crucial interactions between the various levels of language and other cognitive faculties.

Relevant areas of research in LCT include:

*[[Machine translation]]
*[[Information retrieval]]
*[[Ontologies]]
*[[Formal semantics (linguistics)|Formal semantics]]
*[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Information and knowledge representation]]
*[[Question answering]]
*[[Speech recognition]] and [[Speech synthesis|synthesis]]
*Models of human language processing and understanding
*[[Psycholinguistics]]

==Educational programs==
The increasing interest in the field is proved by the existence of several European Masters in this dynamic research area:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/selected_projects_action_1_master_courses_en.php Erasmus Mundus – Action 1 – Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses (EMMCs) | EACEA].

[[File:Blue-tailed damselflies (Ischnura elegans) mating, female typica 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Blue-tailed damselfly|Blue-tailed damselflies]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ischnura elegans'') mating]]

In [[biology]], '''mating''' (or '''mateing''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the pairing of either opposite-[[sex]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[organism]]s, usually for the purposes of [[sexual reproduction]]. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. ''[[Fertilization]]'' is the fusion of both [[Germ cell|sex cell]] or [[gamete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]]'' is the union of the [[sex organ]]s of two sexually reproducing animals for [[insemination]] and subsequent [[internal fertilization]]. Mating may also lead to [[external fertilization]], as seen in [[amphibians]], [[fish]]es and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization ([[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]]); for example, [[banana slug]]s.

The term ''mating'' is also applied to related processes in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[virus]]es.  Mating in these cases involves the pairing of individuals, accompanied by the pairing of their [[homologous chromosomes]] and then exchange of genomic information leading to formation of [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] progeny (see [[mating systems]]).

==Animals==
{{Main|Animal sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Copulation (zoology)|Human mating strategies}}

For animals, mating strategies include [[random mating]], [[disassortative mating]], [[assortative mating]], or a [[mating pool]]. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as [[nest]]-building and [[nutrition|feed]]ing offspring. The human practice of mating and [[Artificial_insemination#Artificial_insemination_in_livestock_and_pets|artificially inseminating domesticated animals]] is part of [[animal husbandry]].

In some [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s, including [[insect]]s representing [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (primitive) [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] clades, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure.  [[Courtship display|Courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as [[dragonflies]] and many [[spider]]s, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[sternite]]s on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male [[pedipalp]]s). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "[[spermatophore]]") into the female's reproductive tract.

Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) reproduce with internal fertilization through [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]),{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while [[Mating behavior of mammals|mammals copulate vagina]]lly.&lt;ref name="Hyman1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=copulate&amp;f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants and fungi==
{{Main|Mating systems#In plants|Mating in fungi|Mating of yeast}}

Like in animals, mating in other Eukaryotes, such as [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], denotes {{clarify span|sexual conjugation|date=April 2013}}. However, in vascular plants this is mostly achieved without physical contact between mating individuals (see [[pollination]]), and in some cases, e.g., in fungi no distinguishable male or female organs exist (see [[isogamy]]); however, [[mating type]]s in some fungal species are somewhat analogous to [[sexual dimorphism]] in animals, and determine whether or not two individual isolates can mate. ''[[Yeasts]]'' are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s classified in the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[fungus|Fungi]], with 1,500 [[species]] currently described.&lt;ref name="YeastRef2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |title=What are yeasts? |work=Yeast Virtual Library |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151906/http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under high stress conditions like [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and produce a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate) and reform the [[diploid]].&lt;ref name=Neiman2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neiman, A.M. |title=Ascospore formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=565–584 |year=2005 |pmid=16339736 |pmc=1306807 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.69.4.565-584.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protists==

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes including protists such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''. In many eukaryotic species, mating is promoted by [[sex pheromones]] including the protist ''[[Blepharisma japonicum]].'' Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes.  A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating.  To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in ''G. intestinalis''.&lt;ref name="pmid17980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR |title=Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/evolutionary-origin-and-adaptive-function-of-meiosis Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

[[File:Novotroick IMG 6406.jpg|thumb|[[Novotroitsk]], a monotown in [[Orenburg Oblast]], Russia]]
A '''monotown''' (a [[calque]] from Russian [[:ru:wikt:моногород|моногород]], ''monogorod''; ''gorod'' meaning "town") is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city/town]] whose economy is dominated by a single industry or company. This means that most employments (except for service to residents like schools and shops) are by the main company.

==Russia==
The term ''monotown'' is especially often used in Russia, where the Soviet [[planned economy]] created hundreds of monotowns in supposedly rational locations, often in geographically inhospitable areas. The situation in many of Russia's monotowns is highly problematic: they are entirely dependent on the competitiveness of a single company or factory, very unflexible and based on Soviet-era economics and technologies.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|title=Russian Economic Report, June 2010|publisher=World Bank|date=June 2010|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110112659/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|archive-date=2010-11-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|title=Darkness on the Edge of Monotown|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-10-16|access-date=2018-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060917/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|archive-date=2018-10-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most monotowns were built essentially as residential extensions of particular enterprises (so called "city-forming enterprises"), their population being either engaged in the city-forming enterprise's manufacturing process, or providing various services to the former group. The core workforce in monotowns was largely formed by the centralized workforce distribution system (people being assigned to an enterprise for a certain number of years after completing the education - which essentially replaced tuition payment, or transferred from other enterprises) rather than by spontaneous migration processes, as it was the case in less specialized towns. Combined, these factors led to narrow and inflexible economies and an immobile workforce, by the standards of the market economy newly introduced into the country in late 1980s - early 1990s.

By the time the city-forming enterprises had been privatized and / or liquidated, the workforce management system already ceased to exist, so the leftover workforce could not be transferred to other regions retaining the living conditions, as it was done during the Soviet era following the liquidation of a no longer needed enterprise. Monotown residents proved to be hesitant to move away on their own and seek work elsewhere as well, mostly because the state housing distribution system lied almost dead at the time, and very low market value of their real estate didn't let them count on minimally comfortable apartments in any other developed town (agricultural sector was and is even more depressive in most regions of Russia, making countryside largely unattractive for the town-dwellers).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===History===
According to a Russian government study conducted in 1999—2000, there were 467 cities and 332 smaller towns in Russia which could be classified as monotowns. The combined population of these towns was 25 million, or a sixth of the country's total population. The 900 monotown enterprises—most of them involved in heavy industries such as manufacturing, fuels, timber, pulp and metallurgy—accounted for more than 30% of industrial production.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

The monotowns suffered greatly in the [[late-2000s recession]], leading to mass unemployment in the cities.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; Having no other hope, people have only one option - to protest.

In one high-profile incident, in 2009 some 300 residents of the north-western town of [[Pikalyovo, Leningrad Oblast|Pikalyovo]] blocked a major highway to protest against large delays in the payments of wages.&lt;ref name="pikalevo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|title=Protesters in northwest Russia block road over plant closures|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-02|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614123347/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|archive-date=2009-06-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] traveled to the city and ordered the owner of the city's dominant company [[BasEl Cement Pikalyovo]], [[Oleg Deripaska]] to pay over 41 million rubles ($1.3 million) of wage arrears to the city's residents. The sum was paid out and the situation in the city calmed down, but questions remained about the long-term viability of the Pikalyovo plants.&lt;ref name="pikalevo2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|title=Protesting workers in northwest Russia paid wage arrears|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-04|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127184023/http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|archive-date=2011-11-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the official list of Russian monotowns includes 319 populated places.&lt;ref name="tass17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Список моногородов в России "заморожен" до конца 2018 года |url=https://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=ТАСС |date=16 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221354/http://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |archive-date=2018-03-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towns can be removed from the list, if the local economies are deemed to have become sufficiently diversified.&lt;ref name="tass17"/&gt; In late 2017, 14 million Russians lived in officially designated monotowns.&lt;ref name="ft17a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s next revolution: how technology came to the mines |url=https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207123313/https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |archive-date=2018-02-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fund for the Development of Monotowns was established in 2014, to invest in infrastructure and promote economic diversification.&lt;ref name="ft16a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s ‘monotowns’ face imminent collapse |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=6 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009055925/https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotown list is divided into categories, depending on the socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shastitko |first1=A. |last2=Fatikhova |first2=A. |title=Monotowns: A Quantitative Analysis |journal=Baltic Region |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=4–19 |doi=10.5922/2079-8555-2016-2-1 |url=https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160109/https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monotowns are not necessarily economically stagnant: [[Norilsk]] has an above average employment rate, as well as relatively high salaries.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"/&gt;

===Examples===
Russia's largest monotown is [[Tolyatti]], which has a population of 700,000. It is home to the large [[AvtoVAZ]] factory, which in late 2008 employed 106,000 people. AvtoVAZ is Russia's largest carmaker, accounting for 1% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;{{dated info|date=October 2018}} As of 2014, the AvtoVAZ is owned by Nissan-Renault, which uses even harsher workforce policies than the previous owner.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, the situation is somewhat aided by widespread of small-scale car parts producers and other small car-oriented enterprises in the region, which are providing many additional workplaces.

[[Dalnegorsk]], located in the [[Russian Far East]], is a monotown with a population of nearly 40,000 people. The town's economy is completely dominated by two mining and metallurgy companies: JSC [[Bor (enterprise)|Bor]] and JSC [[Dalpolimetal]], both subsidiaries of OOO UK Russian mining company (RGRK). They produce zinc and lead concentrates as well as boric acid colemanite.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010" /&gt;

==Soviet Union and other post-Soviet states==
The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet planned economy]] aimed to establish industrial facilities in rational locations, based on military, political, bureaucratic and economic criteria. The goal was to maximise regional specialisation. The dominant enterprise was responsible not only for production, but for providing [[social services]] to the population, such as housing, child care, etc.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], most of the monotowns' dominant enterprises were privatised, and consequently many of them had gone bankrupt by the end of the 1990s, either deliberately (usually it was more profitable to sell the property of an enterprise than to keep it functioning) or due to uncompetitiveness, caused by the shrinkage of the home market outside the consumer goods sector, unrestricted import of low-cost industrial wares from China, Turkey or other countries and the lack of long-term investments by the private owners, who were for the most part interested in quick money rather than development or modernization.

Private owners also mostly refused to provide social services to the populations of monotowns, referring to such practice as being "economically inefficient" - however, the government's attempt to delegate the responsibility of providing social services from the companies to the newly created local municipalities was mostly a failure, as they lacked resources to complete the transformation.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; That led to a radical decrease in quality of life in monotowns, which enjoyed higher-than-average wealth for the most part of the Soviet period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">'''Muntanya Assolada''' is a [[Bronze Age]] settlement located on the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river, in Spain, built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, dominating the river plain from a height of {{convert|227|m}} above sea level. It is located in the municipality of [[Alzira, Valencia]], Spain.

Excavation campaigns began in 1978, under the direction of [[Bernat Martí Oliver]], and continued until 1996, and work on the site was resumed in 2004. From the 1990s [[Rosa Enguix Alemany]] and [[María Jesús de Pedro]] joined the direction of the site. At present the excavated area covers {{convert|700|m2}} and includes different structures, like a central street and rectangular departments on both sides; a wall of two meters wide that preserves almost three meters of height ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}); occupancy soils and abandonment episodes; livestock stabling; and terracing of the slopes to expand its surface.

At present the site is property of the Alzira City council, and the new beginning of the excavations by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] has as objective the consolidation of the exhumed structures and its signposting for visitor access.

A nearby [[burial cave]] indicates the continuity in the use of natural caves as necropolis, and an individual burial has been found in a pit in the interior of the area too. On the other hand, the recovered remains show a wide chronological sequence between the [[Early Bronze Age|Early Bronze]] and the [[Late Bronze Age|Late Bronze]].
[[File:Assolada_localización.jpg|thumb|Location of the Muntanya Assolada]]

== Location ==
On the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river is located the Muntanya Assolada Bronze Age village of Alzira. The settlement was built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, west of Tallat Roig, between the Murta and the Aixavegó ravine, dominating the plain of the river from a height of 227 metres above sea level. The toponym "Muntanya Desolada" refers to the partial collapse of the summit that occurred in autumn of 1783, the night of 24–25 October. Until then the place was known as Muntanya de la Font del Baladre.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_muro.jpg|thumb|Wall area]]

== Archaeological interventions ==
The excavations carried out by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] began in 1978 and continued until 1996, resuming again from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/4497|title=Repositorio Institucional de la Universidad de Alicante |accessdate=9 March 2017 |author=|authorlink= |date= |language= |website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area currently excavated covers more than {{cvt|700|m2}} and corresponds to different room structures with anthropic deposits and evidences of the different activities developed there, such as occupation soils and abandonment episodes in which fire was detected, perhaps due to the combustion of materials accumulated by livestock stabling, and terracing of the slopes to gradually expand the surface of the village. In its upper part, can be seen a central street and departments on both sides. In one of them it has been documented a domestic oven for cooking bread or toasting cereals. And in the other, the entrance has stone steps.

The site is surrounded by a wall that is almost two meters wide and stands three meters high ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}). It was built on a summit that has been terraced by solid stone and clay buildings arranged in slope, thus prolonging the settlement on the slope. The existence of different levels of occupation, documented by stratigraphy and remains, is corroborated by the remodeling of the structures, some of them quickly and intentionally filled to give way to new construction lines. However, it seems to indicate that it was inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_cerámica.jpg |thumb|Ceramic pottery]]
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Puntas_Metall_.jpg|thumb|Metallic tips]]

== Archaeological remains ==
The remains are deposited in the [[Prehistory Museum of Valencia|Museu de Prehistòria de València]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es/web_mupreva/sala/?q=fr&amp;id=119 |title=La Muntanya Assolada (Alzira, Valencia) |accessdate=9 March 2017 |last=Render |website= www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery shows a variety of shapes, such as cups and bowls, pots and storage urns, fairing and geminated vessels, or spoons; and decorative motifs such as incisions, dots, typed strings, or burnished decoration. Among the metallic objects are gravers, arrowheads, a dagger of rivets, and a chisel, as well as other elements linked to the metallurgical activity, such as slags, a stone hammer and a ceramic crucible. The lithic industry has a good representation of sickle and flint arrowheads, polished stone tool and numerous remains of the lithic reductions. The bone industry is represented by gravers, spatulas and chisels, and by a ring and different ivory buttons. The fauna remains show the results of an agricultural village with sheep and goats predominating, the ox being used as an animal of draft and strength, and as a producer of meat and milk. Also the pig was raised, and there are remains of horse and dog. The hunt of the deer, beyond the necessary protection of the crops against herbivores, indicates the existence of a remarkable vegetation cover. The dating of a set of fauna from the lower layer of a space existing between the upper wall and a thickened structure, that is attached to it, has provided a date of 3470 ± 70 BP, between 1890&amp;nbsp;BC and 1690&amp;nbsp;BC.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Enterrament_2.jpg |thumb|Human burial]]

== Human burials ==
The presence of human burials in the site is attested by the excavation of a small sepulchral cave immediately near the village, in the escarpment of its south-east side, which provided remains of a minimum of four individuals, animal bones and part of the grave goods that are with the buried. On the other side, in its westernmost southern slope, in the space delimited by a wide wall and by different stone courses that follow along the outer slope, a circular grave was excavated that contained another human burial, under a sedimentation of more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} of depth. The buried was in fetal position, right lateral decubitus, with the legs folded and the feet crossed. The right arm was elongated behind the back and the hand crushed by a block. The left arm was flexed in front of the body and the hand stretched below the face, missing most of the skull and upper maxilla. The absolute dating of this individual by C-14 has provided a date of 3760 ± 40 BP, between 2210&amp;nbsp;BC and 2130&amp;nbsp;BC.

== Relevance in its context ==
The Muntanya Assolada has been considered as a typical village of the Valencian Bronze Age, according to some decorative motifs of the pottery, globular and tall carena, the archaism of the lithic industry, the copper metallurgy, or the sepulchral cave found next to the village. The end of its habitation is related to the Late Bronze, attending to the fairing vessels with flared profile and with a pronounced angle of inflection, the flat bases or the presence of authentic bronze in the metallic objects. In fact, the typology of the vessels of Muntanya Assolada corresponds to what is usual in the villages of the Valencian Bronze Age. However, in their highest levels, such shapes as the mentioned fairing vessels are accompanied by the geminados, bowls and outgoing edge pots, considered more-evolved. The two absolute dates are shown in accordance with a sequence from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. La Muntanya Assolada and other nearby sites represent the continuity of a settlement that spans from the Bronze Age to the [[Iberian Culture]], in a permanently occupied territory such as the Ribera del [[Xúquer]].

The site was abandoned in the final period of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] or Late Bronze, to give way to a settlement located on the plain, first on Cases de Montcada, during the Late Bronze Age on Escoles Pies and during the [[Iron Age]] on the L'Alteret de la Vintihuitena of Albalat, to occupy later the slope of the highest hills with the arrival of the [[Iberian Culture]].

In 2004 Onians taught the [[Postgraduate]] module "Art and the Brain" named after the 1999 paper by Professor [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, he began working with Zeki, who is a professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[University College London]] (and founder of Neuroesthetics) to study what goes on in the brains of artists. They used [[neuroimaging]] and studied the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes of artists such as the [[painting|painters]] of the [[paleolithic]] [[Chauvet Cave]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2005 Onians founded Neuroarthistory in a lecture at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmiths May 2005. &lt;ref&gt; Onians J (2005) Neuroarthistory: First Principles (A paper presented at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmith Conference May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, he wrote and presented the paper 'Neuroarthistory: making more sense of art' which, according to [[The Art Book]] "explored the ways in which our ever-expanding knowledge of the brain invites art historians to reconsider the interaction between the senses and cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2006, Onians presented the results of the research to the [[BA Festival of Science]] in a lecture called 'Cracking the real Da Vinci Code: what happens in the artist’s brain?'.&lt;ref name="UEArelease"&gt;{{cite press release

  | accessdate = 2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the study was to learn more about how artists think, and how these thought processes differ between artists of different eras and locations, as well as the differences between professional and amateur artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | format = HTML
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Onians has said that neuroarthistory can be used "both to better understand the nature of familiar artistic phenomena such as style, and to crack so far intractable problems such as ‘what is the origin of art?’"&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt; According to a press release, neuroarthistory can explain why "Florentine painters made more use of line and Venetian painters more of colour. The reason is that '[[Synaptic plasticity|neural plasticity]]' ensured that passive exposure to different natural and man-made environments caused the formation of different visual preferences."&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt;

A book, ''Neuroarthistory: From Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'' was published in 2008 by Yale University Press, discussing a number of [[case study|case studies]] from art history, and being the 'preface' to a further two books on the subject. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority''' ({{lang-no|Statens strålevern}}, abbreviated to '''NRPA''') is a Norwegian public agency under the [[Ministry of Health and Care Services (Norway)|Ministry of Health and Care Services]] headquartered in [[Østerås (Bærum)|Østerås]], [[Bærum|Bærum municipality]], [[Greater Oslo Region]]. It works as an authority in the area of [[radiation protection]] and [[nuclear safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keus|first=Andreas|title=Statens strålevern|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/hod/dep/underliggende-etater/statens-stalevern.html?id=279760|work=Helse- og Omsorgsdepartementet|publisher=Regjeringen.no|accessdate=9 October 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NRPA fall under the Ministry of Health and Care Services, but serves all ministries and departments on issues relating to radiation.

==History==
The NRPA was created on January 1, 1993 through the consolidation of the former '''Nuclear Energy Safety Authority''' with the '''National institute of Radiation Hygiene'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste|title=Statens strålevern|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/data/forvaltning/enhet/7822/endringshistorie|work=Endringshistorie|publisher=Nsd.no|accessdate=9 October 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The NRPA is responsible for: overseeing the use of radioactive substances and fissile material, coordinating contingency plans against nuclear accidents and radioactive fallout, monitoring natural and artificial radiation in the environment and at the workplace, increasing our knowledge of the occurrence as well as monitoring risk and effects of radiation. It has regional offices in [[Tromsø]] and [[Sør-Varanger]] and is divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority|title=About the NRPA|url=http://www.nrpa.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=240&amp;trg=Main_6342&amp;Main_6342=6394:0:15,6230:1:0:0:::0:0|publisher=Nrpa.no|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Department of Emergency Preparedness and Environmental Radioactivity
*Department of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety
*Department of Planning and Administration
==International cooperation==
NRPA is involved in extensive international cooperation. This includes cooperation on standards of management, but also a growing collaboration on [[research]] across borders. NRPA cooperates with [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP), and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority|title=International Cooperation|url=http://www.nrpa.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=240&amp;trg=Center_6393&amp;Main_6342=6394:0:15,6232:1:0:0:::0:0&amp;CenterAndRight_6394=6393:0:15,6257:1:0:0:::0:0&amp;Center_6393=6401:83566::1:6442:1:::0:0|work=About NRPA|publisher=Nrpa.no|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pattern''' in architecture is the idea of capturing [[design|architectural design]] ideas as archetypal and reusable descriptions.  The term "pattern" in this context is usually attributed to [[Christopher Alexander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Austrian born [[United States|American]] [[architect]]. The patterns serve as an aid to design [[city|cities]] and [[building]]s. The concept of having collections of "patterns", or typical samples as such, is much older. One can think of these collections as forming a [[pattern language]], whereas the elements of this language may be combined, governed by certain rules.

== Alexander's idea of patterns ==

Alexander's patterns seek to provide a source of proven [[idea]]s for individuals and communities to use in constructing their living and [[built environment|working environment]]. As such their aim is both [[aesthetic]] and [[political]]: to show how beautiful, comfortable and flexible built environments can be constructed, and to enable those people who will inhabit those environments to challenge any [[solution]] forced upon them.

A pattern records the design decisions taken by many builders in many places over many years in order to resolve a particular problem. Alexander describes a problem in terms of the so-called ''forces'' that act in it, and the ''solution'' is said to resolve those forces. If there are still unresolved forces, then additional patterns may be needed to balance these remaining forces.

== Pattern language ==

Patterns may be collected together into a [[pattern language]] that addresses a particular domain. A large body of patterns was published by Alexander and his collaborators as ''[[A Pattern Language]]''. The patterns in that book were intended to enable communities to construct and modify their own [[home]]s, [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].

Other than Alexander's own projects, few building projects have tried to use Alexander's patterns. Those that have done so have met a mixed response from other architects, builders, architectural critics, and users. Alexander has come to believe that patterns themselves are not enough, and that one needs a [[morphogenesis|"morphogenetic"]] understanding of the formation of the built environment. He has published his ideas in the four-volume work ''[[The Nature of Order]]''.

While the pattern language idea has so far had limited impact on the building industry, it has had a profound influence on many workers in the [[information technology industry]].

The '''Professional-Managerial class''' was an influential [[New Class]] hypothesis in [[social science]] in the United States in the 1970s by John and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=John| title=Between Labor and Capital|year=1979|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-89608-037-4|edition=1st|author2=Barbara Ehrenreich |editor=Pat Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ehrenreichs hypothesized a [[social class]] within [[capitalism]] that, by controlling production processes through superior management skills, was neither [[proletarian]] nor [[bourgeois]]. This hypothesis contributed to the [[Marxist]] debates on class in [[Fordism]] and was used as an analytical category in the examination of non-proletarian employees.

This group of [[middle class]] professionals is distinguished from other social classes by their training and education, typically business qualifications and university degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Green|title=Retrieving Democracy: In Search of Civic Equality|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-25|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; with occupations including [[academics]], [[teachers]], [[social workers]], [[engineers]], [[managers]], [[nurses]], and middle-level [[Administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Hansfried|title=Hidden Technocrats: The New Class and New Capitalism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-26|publisher=Transaction Publishers|author2=Frank W. Heuberger |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The professional-managerial class tends to have incomes above the average for their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gail|first=Kelly|title=Women's higher education in comparative perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-CKcuRAu8EC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;q=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class%20salary&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|author2=Sheila Slaughter |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that in the [[United States]] during 1930, people in professional-managerial class occupations made up less than 1 percent of total employment. In 1972, about 24 percent of American jobs were in professional-managerial class occupations. By 1983 the number had risen to 28 percent and in 2006, 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Barbara and John Ehrenreich: The Real Story Behind the Crash and Burn of America's Managerial Class|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/barbara-and-john-ehrenreich-real-story-behind-crash-and-burn-americas-managerial-class?page=0%2C0|work=AlterNet|accessdate=18 November 2013|author2=John Ehrenreich |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rome-Pantheon-Interieur1.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] is an example of Roman concrete construction.]]

'''Roman concrete''', also called '''opus caementicium''', was a material used in construction during the late [[Roman Republic]] until the fading of the [[Roman Empire]]. Roman [[concrete]] was based on a [[hydraulic cement|hydraulic-setting cement]].  Recently, it has been found that it materially differs in several ways from modern concrete which is based on [[Portland cement]].  Roman concrete is durable due to its incorporation of [[volcanic ash]], which prevents cracks from spreading. By the middle of the 1st century, the material was used frequently, often brick-faced, although variations in aggregate allowed different arrangements of materials. Further innovative developments in the material, called the [[Concrete Revolution]], contributed to structurally complicated forms, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] dome, the world's largest and oldest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name="Ancient Roman Concrete"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/spillway/spillway.htm | title=The Riddle of Ancient Roman Concrete | publisher=www.romanconcrete.com | work=S Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region | date=February 1993 | accessdate=20 May 2013 | author=Moore, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman concrete was normally faced with stone or brick, and interiors might be further decorated by [[stucco]], [[fresco]] paintings, or thin slabs of fancy colored marbles. Made up of aggregate and cement, like modern concrete, it differed in that the aggregate pieces were typically far larger than in modern concrete, often amounting to rubble, and as a result it was laid rather than poured.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Martin (ed), ''A Handbook of Roman Art'', p. 30, Phaidon, 1983, {{ISBN|0714822140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Roman concretes were able to be set underwater, which was useful for bridges and other waterside construction.

It is uncertain when Roman concrete was developed, but it was clearly in widespread and customary use from about 150 BC; some scholars believe it was developed a century before that.&lt;ref&gt;[[Axel Boëthius|Boëthius, Axel]], [[Roger Ling|Ling, Roger]], [[Tom Rasmussen|Rasmussen, Tom]], ''Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture'', pp. 128-129, Yale/Pelican history of art, 1978, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0300052901}}, 9780300052909, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1nZswjfqROUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic references==
[[File:Caesarea Concrete Bath.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] is the earliest known example to have used underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.]][[Vitruvius]], writing around 25 BC in his [[De architectura|''Ten Books on Architecture'']], distinguished types of aggregate appropriate for the preparation of [[lime mortar]]s. For [[structural mortar]]s, he recommended [[pozzolana]] (''pulvis puteolanus'' in Latin), the volcanic sand from the beds of [[Pozzuoli]], which are brownish-yellow-gray in color in that area around Naples, and reddish-brown near Rome. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cement used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pozzolana for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used in marine locations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution", ''Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future'', edited by W.D. Kingery and published by the American Ceramics Society, 1986; and Vitruvius, Book II:v,1; Book V:xii2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the first century, the principles of underwater construction in concrete were well known to Roman builders. The city of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] was the earliest known example to have made use of underwater Roman concrete technology on such a large scale.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

For rebuilding Rome after the [[Great Fire of Rome|fire in 64 AD]], which destroyed large portions of the city, [[Nero]]'s new building code largely called for brick-faced concrete. This appears to have encouraged the development of the brick and concrete industries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Material properties==

Roman concrete, like any [[concrete]], consists of an [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] and hydraulic [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] – a binder mixed with water that hardens over time. The aggregate varied, and included pieces of rock, [[ceramic]] tile, and brick rubble from the remains of previously demolished buildings.

[[Gypsum]] and [[calcium oxide|quicklime]] were used as binders. Volcanic dusts, called [[pozzolana]] or "pit sand", were favored where they could be obtained. Pozzolana makes the concrete more resistant to salt water than modern-day concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Erin. “The Secrets of Ancient Rome’s Buildings.” Smithsonian.com. 16 November 2011. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The pozzolanic mortar used had a high content of [[alumina]] and [[silica]]. [[Tuff]] was often used as an aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xxl4t|title=Rome's Invisible City - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete, and in particular, the hydraulic mortar responsible for its cohesion, was a type of structural ceramic whose utility derived largely from its [[Rheology|rheological plasticity]] in the paste state. The setting and hardening of hydraulic cements derived from hydration of materials and the subsequent chemical and physical interaction of these hydration products. This differed from the setting of [[lime mortar|slaked lime mortars]], the most common cements of the pre-Roman world. Once set, Roman concrete exhibited little plasticity, although it retained some resistance to tensile stresses.

The setting of [[geopolymer|pozzolanic cements]] has much in common with setting of their modern counterpart, [[Portland cement]]. The high silica composition of Roman pozzolana cements is very close to that of modern cement to which blast furnace [[slag]], [[fly ash]], or [[silica fume]] have been added.  

The strength and longevity of Roman ''marine'' concrete is understood to benefit from a reaction of [[seawater]] with a mixture of [[volcanic ash]] and quicklime to create a rare crystal called [[tobermorite]], which may resist fracturing. As seawater percolated within the tiny cracks in the Roman concrete, it reacted with [[phillipsite]] naturally found in the volcanic rock and created [[Aluminium|aluminous]] tobermorite crystals. The result is a candidate for "the most durable building material in human history". In contrast, modern concrete exposed to saltwater deteriorates within decades.&lt;ref name="WashPost2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guarino |first1=Ben |title=Ancient Romans made world's 'most durable' concrete.

Bailey, "Mechanical Properties and Tensile Failure Mechanism of a High Strength Polymer Modified Portland Cement", ''J. Mater. Sci.'', 19, 2677–2685 (1984); and Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; There are no comparable mechanical data for ancient mortars, although some information about tensile strength may be inferred from the cracking of Roman concrete domes. These tensile strengths vary substantially from the water/cement ratio used in the initial mix. At present, there is no way of ascertaining what water/cement ratios the Romans used, nor are there extensive data for the effects of this ratio on the strengths of pozzolanic cements.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtman and Hobbs, "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"; see also: C. A. Langton and D. M. Roy, "Longevity of Borehole and Shaft Sealing Materials: Characterization of Ancient Cement Based Building Materials", ''Mat. Res. Soc. SYmp. Proc.'' 26, 543–549 (1984); and Topical Report ONWI-202, Battelle Memorial Institute, Office of Nuclear Waste Isolation, Distribution Category UC-70, National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic technology==
For an environment as prone to [[earthquake]]s as the [[Italian peninsula]], interruptions and internal constructions within walls and domes created discontinuities in the concrete mass. Portions of the building could then shift slightly when there was movement of the earth to accommodate such stresses, enhancing the overall strength of the structure. It was in this sense that bricks and concrete were flexible. It may have been precisely for this reason that, although many buildings sustained serious cracking from a variety of causes, they continue to stand to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technology used to improve the [[strength of materials|strength]] and stability of concrete was its gradation in domes. One example is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], where the aggregate of the upper dome region consists of alternating layers of light [[tuff]] and [[pumice]], giving the concrete a density of 1,350&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The foundation of the structure used [[travertine]] as an aggregate, having a much higher density of 2,200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;K. de Fine Licht, The Rotunda in Rome: A Study of Hadrian's Pantheon. Jutland Archaeological Society, Copenhagen, 1968, pp. 89–94, 134–35; and Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Recent scientific breakthroughs examining Roman concrete have been gathering media and industry attention.&lt;ref&gt;Sezen Soyer-Uzun, Sejung Rosie Chae, Chris J. Benmore, Hans-Rudolf Wenk, Paulo J. M. Monteiro, "Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering", Journal of the American Ceramic Society, Volume: 95 Issue: 2 Pages: 793-798, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trebcap.com/fixing-canadas-infrastructure-with-volcanoes/ |title= Fixing Canada's Infrastructure with Volcanoes |publisher=Trebuchet Capital Partners Research |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its unusual durability, longevity and lessened environmental footprint, corporations and municipalities are starting to explore the use of Roman-style concrete in North America, substituting the coal [[fly ash]] with volcanic ash that has similar properties. Proponents claim that concrete made with volcanic ash can cost up to 60% less because it requires less cement, and that it has a smaller environmental footprint due to its lower cooking temperature and much longer lifespan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Compositional Evolution of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Structures by Total X-Ray Scattering&lt;/ref&gt; Usable examples of Roman concrete exposed to harsh marine environments have been found to be 2000 years old with little or no wear.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''''' (1962; second edition 1970; third edition 1996; fourth edition 2012) is a book about the [[history of science]] by the philosopher [[Thomas S. Kuhn]]. Its publication was a landmark event in the [[History of science|history]], [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]], and [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].  Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in "[[normal science]]".  Normal [[scientific progress]] was viewed as "development-by-accumulation" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of "anomalies" during revolutions in science leads to new [[paradigms]].  New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the "map" directing new research.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Thomas S. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. 3rd ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996. Asking new questions of old data on pages 139, 159.  Moving beyond "puzzle-solving" on pages 37, 144.  Change in rule sets on pages 40, 41, 52, 175.  Change in the direction or "map" of research on pages 109, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Kuhn's analysis of the [[Copernican Revolution]] emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the [[Ptolemaic system]], but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler, solutions that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution its "paradigms" and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn's insistence that a [[paradigm shift]] was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For some commentators ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements.

==History==
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was first published as a [[monograph]] in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', then as a book by [[University of Chicago Press]] in 1962. In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition. A 50th Anniversary Edition (with an introductory essay by [[Ian Hacking]]) was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|last2=Hacking|first2=Ian|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-226-45812-0|location=Chicago|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] and had been asked to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical [[case study|case studies]]. Kuhn later commented that until then, "I'd never read an old document in science." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics'' was astonishingly unlike [[Isaac Newton]]'s work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote "... as I was reading him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors, both of logic and of observation." This was in an apparent contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant mind. While perusing Aristotle's ''Physics'', Kuhn formed the view that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle's reasoning, one must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not "bad Newton," just different.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/technologyandhumanities/kuhn.htm] Thomas Kuhn, "What Are Scientific Revolutions?", an excerpt from The Probablistic Revolution, Volume I: Ideas in History, eds. Lorenz Kruger, Lorraine, J. Daston, and Michael Heidelberger (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987), pp. 7-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This insight was the foundation of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref name=naughton2012&gt;{{Citation | last = Naughton | first = John | author-link = John Naughton | date = 18 August 2012 | title = Thomas Kuhn: the man who changed the way the world looked at science | newspaper = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions | accessdate = 24 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the publication of Kuhn’s book, a number of ideas regarding the process of scientific investigation and discovery had already been proposed. [[Ludwik Fleck]] developed the first system of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in his book ''The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' (1935). He claimed that the exchange of ideas led to the establishment of a thought collective, which, when developed sufficiently, served to separate the field into esoteric (professional) and exoteric (laymen) circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache. Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=Schwabe und Co.|year=1935|isbn=|location=Verlagsbuchhandlung, Basel|pages=|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and development of a scientific fact|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn wrote the foreword to the 1979 edition of Fleck's book, noting that he read it in 1950 and was reassured that someone "saw in the history of science what I myself was finding there."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kuhn was not confident about how his book would be received. Harvard University had denied his tenure, a few years before. However, by the mid-1980s, his book had achieved blockbuster status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaiser|first1=David|title=In retrospect: the structure of scientific revolutions|journal=Nature|date=2012|volume=484|pages=164-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One theory to which Kuhn replies directly is [[Karl Popper|Karl Popper’s]] “falsificationism,” which stresses [[falsifiability]] as the most important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses [[verificationism]], a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among [[Logical positivism|logical positivists.]] The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by [[empirical evidence]] or logical requirements.

==Synopsis==

===Basic approach===
Kuhn's approach to the [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]] focuses on conceptual issues like the practice of [[normal science]], influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through [[scientific revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=|pages=210|authorlink=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|non-linear history]].

Kuhn did not see scientific theory as proceeding linearly from an objective,  unbiased accumulation of all available data, but rather as paradigm-driven. “The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not ‘the given’ of experience but rather ‘the collected with diffculty.’ They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|page=|pages=126|authorlink=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Historical examples of chemistry===
Kuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the [[history of science]]. For instance, eighteenth century scientists believed that homogenous solutions were [[chemical compound]]s.  Therefore, a combination of [[water]] and [[alcohol]] was generally classified as a ''compound''. Nowadays it is considered to be a ''solution'', but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate completely upon [[distillation]] (they form an [[azeotrope]]). Water and alcohol can be [[miscibility|combined in any proportion]].

Under this paradigm, scientists believed that chemical reactions (such as the combination of water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by [[John Dalton|Dalton’s]] [[atomic theory]], which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion could not be a chemical process. This type world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn's paradigm shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copernican Revolution===
{{main article|Copernican Revolution}}
A famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|Copernican Revolution]]. In [[Ptolemy]]'s school of thought, [[Deferent and epicycle|cycles and epicycles]] (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the [[planet]]s in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As [[accuracy]] of [[celestial observation]]s increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. [[Copernicus]] proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus' contemporaries rejected his [[cosmology]], and Kuhn asserts that they were quite right to do so: Copernicus' cosmology lacked credibility.

Kuhn illustrates how a paradigm shift later became possible when [[Galileo Galilei]] introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of [[nature]]: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.

Galileo put forward a bold alternative conjecture: suppose, he said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some [[friction]] is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its [[speed]] without the application of any additional [[force]].

The Ptolemaic approach of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there seemed to be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. [[Johannes Kepler]] was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet [[Mars]] might have an [[elliptical orbit]] rather than a [[circular orbit|circular]] one. Clearly, the [[angular velocity]] could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Kepler's second law|law of equal areas]].

Galileo's conjecture was merely that &amp;mdash; a conjecture. So was Kepler's cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] showed that Kepler's three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.

===Coherence===
One of the aims of science is to find models that will account for as many observations as possible within a coherent framework. Together, Galileo's rethinking of the nature of motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a coherent framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.

Once a paradigm shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often the [[history of science]] too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process ''[[normal science]]''.

As a paradigm is stretched to its limits, ''anomalies'' &amp;mdash; failures of the current paradigm to take into account observed phenomena &amp;mdash; accumulate. Their significance is judged by the practitioners of the discipline. Some anomalies may be dismissed as errors in observation, others as merely requiring small adjustments to the current paradigm that will be clarified in due course. Some anomalies resolve themselves spontaneously, having increased the available depth of insight along the way. But no matter how great or numerous the anomalies that persist, Kuhn observes, the practicing scientists will not lose faith in the established paradigm until a credible alternative is available; to lose faith in the solvability of the problems would in effect mean ceasing to be a scientist.

In any community of scientists, Kuhn states, there are some individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a ''crisis'' exists, embark on what Kuhn calls ''revolutionary science'', exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear to be accompanied by numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a ''paradigm shift'' will have occurred.

===Phases===
Kuhn explains the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.

* Phase 1&amp;nbsp;– It exists only once and is the ''pre-paradigm phase'', in which there is no consensus on any particular [[theory]]. This phase is characterized by several incompatible and incomplete theories. Consequently, most scientific inquiry takes the form of lengthy books, as there is no common body of facts that may be taken for granted.  If the actors in the pre-paradigm community eventually gravitate to one of these [[conceptual framework]]s and ultimately to a widespread consensus on the appropriate choice of [[Scientific method|methods]], [[terminology]] and on the kinds of [[experiment]] that are likely to contribute to increased [[insight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=II. The Route to Normal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2&amp;nbsp;– [[Normal science]] begins, in which puzzles are solved within the context of the dominant paradigm. As long as there is consensus within the discipline, normal science continues. Over time, progress in normal science may reveal anomalies, facts that are difficult to explain within the context of the existing paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=VI. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries}}&lt;/ref&gt; While usually these anomalies are resolved, in some cases they may accumulate to the point where normal science becomes difficult and where weaknesses in the old paradigm are revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolution|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=III. The Nature of Normal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 3&amp;nbsp;– If the paradigm proves chronically unable to account for anomalies, the community enters a crisis period. Crises are often resolved within the context of normal science. However, after significant efforts of normal science within a paradigm fail, science may enter the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=VII. Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 4&amp;nbsp;– [[Paradigm shift]], or scientific revolution, is the phase in which the underlying assumptions of the field are reexamined and a new paradigm is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=Section IX.

* Phase 5&amp;nbsp;– Post-Revolution, the new paradigm's dominance is established and so scientists return to normal science, solving puzzles within the new paradigm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|chapter=XII. The Resolution of Revolutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A science may go through these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes that it is a good thing for science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.

===Incommensurability===
According to Kuhn, the scientific paradigms preceding and succeeding a paradigm shift are so different that their theories are [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] &amp;mdash; the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of 'commensurable' versus 'incommensurable' was as a distinction between ''languages'', namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in ''in''commensurable languages, strict translation is not possible.&lt;ref name=Conant&gt;

{{cite book |page=4 |chapter=Editors' introduction |author=James Conant, John Haugeland |title=The Road Since Structure: Philosophical Essays, 1970-1993, with an Autobiographical Interview |edition=2nd |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226457990}}

&lt;/ref&gt;) The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.
Such incommensurability exists not just before and after a paradigm shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language that can be used to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: ''"Though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up [[talking past each other|talking past one another]].

Kuhn states that the probabilistic tools used by [[Verificationism|verificationists]] are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to [[falsifiability|falsify]] a statement will fall under one of the paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kuhn further developed his ideas regarding incommensurability in the 1980s and 1990s. In his unpublished manuscript ''The Plurality of Worlds'', Kuhn introduces the theory of ''kind concepts:'' sets of interrelated concepts that are characteristic of a time period in a science and differ in structure from the modern analogous kind concepts. These different structures imply different “[[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]]” of things and processes, and this difference in taxonomies constitutes incommensurability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions - 50 Years On|last=Hoyningen-Huene|first=Paul|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-13382-9|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science|volume=311|chapter=Kuhn’s Development Before and After Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is strongly naturalistic and draws on developmental psychology to “found a quasi-transcendental theory of experience and of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13383-6_13|title=Kuhn’s Development Before and After Structure|last=Hoyningen-Huene|first=Paul|date=March 19, 2015|website=Springer Link|publisher=Springer International Publishing|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplar===
Kuhn introduced the concept of an '''exemplar''' in a [[postscript]] to the second edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term 'exemplars' for 'paradigm', meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, [[physicists]] might have as exemplars the [[inclined plane]], [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], or instruments like the [[calorimeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|date=1970|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-45804-0|page=187|edition=2nd, Enlarged|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|title=Thomas Kuhn|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kuhn, scientific practice alternates between periods of [[normal science]] and [[revolutionary science]]. During periods of normalcy, scientists tend to subscribe to a large body of interconnecting knowledge, methods, and assumptions which make up the reigning [[paradigm]] (see [[paradigm shift]]). Normal science presents a series of problems that are solved as scientists explore their field.  The solutions to some of these problems become well known and are the exemplars of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Ladyman|first2=James|title=Arguing about Science|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415492294|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iGpd3xLGNbYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=well+known+and+are+the+exemplars+of+the+field&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1pbH6r4V31&amp;sig=HrM_caYtCICZB7lj47STp59wmnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii1c25v7vWAhWLI8AKHVLJDC8Q6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=well%20known%20and%20are%20the%20exemplars%20of%20the%20field&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions|url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster/220/notes_8.html|website=philosophy.wisc.edu|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who study a scientific discipline are expected to know its exemplars.  There is no fixed set of exemplars, but for a physicist today it would probably include the [[harmonic oscillator]] from [[mechanics]] and the [[hydrogen atom]] from [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wray|first1=K.

==Kuhn on scientific progress==
The first edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' ended with a chapter titled "Progress through Revolutions", in which Kuhn spelled out his views on the nature of scientific progress. Since he considered problem solving to be a central element of science, Kuhn saw that for a new candidate paradigm to be accepted by a scientific community, "First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem solving activity that has accrued to science through its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=T.S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|location=Chicago, IL|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the new paradigm is rarely as expansive as the old paradigm in its initial stages, it must nevertheless have significant promise for future problem-solving. As a result, though new paradigms seldom or never possess all the capabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve a great deal of the most concrete parts of past achievement and they always permit additional concrete problem-solutions besides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|title=Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=9780226458113|edition=1st|location=Chicago, IL|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition, Kuhn added a postscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the nature of scientific progress. He described a thought experiment involving an observer who has the opportunity to inspect an assortment of theories, each corresponding to a single stage in a succession of theories. What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that it will be possible to reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories' scope and content, because the more recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: "That is not a [[relativism|relativist's]] position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=Chicago University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780226458113|edition=2nd|location=Chicago, IL|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed further in David Weinberger "Shift Happens."

==Influence and reception==
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' has been credited with producing the kind of "paradigm shift" Kuhn discussed.&lt;ref name=naughton2012/&gt; Since the book’s publication, over one million copies have been sold, including translations into sixteen different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Figures cited in John Horgan, “Profile: Reluctant Revolutionary—Thomas S. Kuhn Unleashed ‘Paradigm’ on the World,” ''Scientific American'' (May 1991), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, it was reported to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited in the period 1976–1983 in the arts and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;E. Garfield, "A Different Sort of Great Books List: The 50 Twentieth-Century Works Most Cited in the ''Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index'', 1976-1983", ''Current Contents'' no. 16, 20 April 1987, pp. 3-7 [http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v10p101y1987.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy&lt;!--'Historical turn' redirects here--&gt; ===
The first extensive review of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was authored by Dudley Shapere, a philosopher who interpreted Kuhn's work as a continuation of the anti-[[Positivism|positivist]] sentiment of other philosophers of science, including [[Paul Feyerabend]] and [[Norwood Russell Hanson]]. Shapere noted the book’s influence on the philosophical landscape of the time, calling it “a sustained attack on the prevailing image of scientific change as a linear process of ever-increasing knowledge.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapere|first=Dudley|date=1964|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|url=|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|page=383|doi=10.2307/2183664|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]], Kuhn discredited the ahistorical and prescriptive approach to the philosophy of science of Ernest Nagel's ''[[The Structure of Science]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=637 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn's book sparked a [[Historicism|historicist]] "revolt against positivism" (the so-called "'''historical turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in philosophy of science" which looked to the history of science as a source of data for developing a philosophy of science),&lt;ref&gt;K. Brad Wray, ''Kuhn's Evolutionary Social Epistemology'', Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not have been Kuhn’s intention; in fact, he had already approached the prominent positivist [[Rudolf Carnap]] about having his work published in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Steve|date=1992|title=Being There with Thomas Kuhn: A Parable for Postmodern Times|url=|journal=History and Theory|volume=31.3|page=244|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]] noted that Kuhn's views have often been suggested to have an affinity to those of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Solomon, Robert C. |title=In the Spirit of Hegel: A Study of G.

=== Sociology ===
The first field to claim descent from Kuhn’s ideas was the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Steve|date=1992|title=Being There with Thomas Kuhn: A Parable for Postmodern Times|url=|journal=History and Theory|volume=31.3|page=247|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|Sociologists]] working within this new field, including [[Harry Collins]] and [[Steven Shapin]], used Kuhn’s emphasis on the role of non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against [[logical empiricism]], which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn’s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and [[Ideology|political ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title=The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|last=Longino|first=Helen|date=April 12, 2002|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] detailed the connection between the sociology of scientific knowledge and Kuhn in his book ''T. S. Kuhn and Social Science.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=T.S. Kuhn and Social Science|last=Barnes|first=Barry|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=9780231054362|location=New York City, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Kuhn’s ideas regarding science occurring within an established framework informed Barnes's own ideas regarding finitism, a theory wherein meaning is continuously changed (even during periods of normal science) by its usage within the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziman|first=J.M.|date=1982|title=T.

''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' elicited a number of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book's publication, some sociologists expressed the belief that the field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards homogenization. Others argued that the field was in the midst of normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], doubted that Kuhn's theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|date=1973|title=Thomas S.

=== Economics ===
Developments in the field of economics are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] have claimed “to be at the second stage [normal science], and to have been there for a very long time – since [[Adam Smith]], according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] according to others (Hutchison, 1978).”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Post Keynesian Economics Since 1936|last=King|first=J.E.|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=1843766507|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post Keynesian]] economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While perhaps less explicit, Kuhn’s influence remains apparent in recent economics. For instance, the abstract of [[Olivier Blanchard|Olivier Blanchard’s]] paper “The State of Macro” (2008) begins:{{Quote|text=For a long while after the explosion of macroeconomics in the 1970s, the field looked like a battlefield. Over time however, largely because facts do not go away, a largely shared vision both of fluctuations and of methodology has emerged. Not everything is fine. Like all revolutions, this one has come with the destruction of some knowledge, and suffers from extremism and herding.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Olivier J. ''The State of Macro''. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2008, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Political science ===
In 1974, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was ranked as the second most frequently used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Charles|date=1974|title=Whose Works Must Graduate Students Read?|journal=A NEW Political Science|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Kuhn’s theory has been used by political scientists to critique [[behavioralism]], which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricci|first=David|date=1977|title=Reading Thomas Kuhn in the Post-Behavioral Era|jstor=448209|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=30|doi=10.1177/106591297703000102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Jerome|date=1973|title=The Kuhnian Paradigm and Political Inquiry: An Appraisal|jstor=2110740|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=17|page=468|doi=10.2307/2110740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes that occur in [[politics]], [[society]] and [[business]] are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms "[[paradigm]]" and "[[paradigm shift]]" have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are sometimes viewed as effectively devoid of content.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999).[http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html] Retrieved on 2008-04-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142-143, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001), {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge pb.png|thumb|200 px|Front cover of Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, ed., ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge''.]]
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was soon criticized by Kuhn's colleagues in the history and philosophy of science. In 1965, a special symposium on the book was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], London, and was chaired by [[Karl Popper]]. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium's presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics' readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was "...tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns," one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by "Professors Popper, Feyerabend, [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] and Watkins."&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, eds. ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'': Volume 4: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), pp. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the included essays question the existence of normal science. In his essay, Feyerabend suggests that Kuhn’s conception of normal science fits organized crime as well as it does science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolby|first=R. G. A.|date=1971|title=Reviewed Work: Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge.

===Concept of paradigm===
In his 1972 work, ''Human Understanding'', [[Stephen Toulmin]] argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin's view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call "normal science." For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Understanding |last=Toulmin |first=S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1972 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-824361-8 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incommensurability of paradigms===
In a series of texts published in the early 1970s, Carl R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.&lt;ref name="Kord" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Kordig |first=Carl R. |date=December 1973 |title=Discussion: Observational Invariance |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=40 |issue= |pages=558–569 |doi=10.1086/288565 |jstor=186288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kordig maintains that there is a common observational plane. For example, when [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that "rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings." Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this polarity.

At a secondary level, for Kordig there is a common plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.&lt;ref name="Kord" /&gt;

In 1973, [[Hartry Field]] published an article that also sharply criticized Kuhn's idea of incommensurability. In particular, he took issue with this passage from Kuhn:

{{quote|Newtonian mass is immutably conserved; that of Einstein is convertible into energy. Only at very low relative velocities can the two masses be measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived as if they were the same thing. (Kuhn 1970).}}

Field takes this idea of incommensurability between the same terms in different theories one step further. Instead of attempting to identify a persistence of the reference of terms in different theories, Field's analysis emphasizes the indeterminacy of reference within individual theories. Field takes the example of the term "mass", and asks what exactly "mass" means in modern post-relativistic physics. He finds that there are at least two different definitions:

# Relativistic mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since the total energy of a particle in relation to one system of reference differs from the total energy in relation to other systems of reference, while the speed of light remains constant in all systems, it follows that the mass of a particle has different values in different systems of reference.
# "Real" mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the ''non-kinetic'' energy of a particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since non-kinetic energy is the same in all systems of reference, and the same is true of light, it follows that the mass of a particle has the same value in all systems of reference.

Projecting this distinction backwards in time onto Newtonian dynamics, we can formulate the following two hypotheses:

* HR: the term "mass" in Newtonian theory denotes relativistic mass.
* Hp: the term "mass" in Newtonian theory denotes "real" mass.

According to Field, it is impossible to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term "mass" was ''referentially indeterminate''. But this does not mean that the term "mass" did not have a different ''meaning'' than it now has. The problem is not one of meaning but of ''reference''. The reference of such terms as mass is only ''partially determined'': we don't really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a [[scientific revolution]]; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as "mass" as "having undergone a denotional refinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Field |first=H. |authorlink=Hartry Field |date=August 1973 |title=Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |volume=70 |issue=14 |pages=462–481 |doi=10.2307/2025110 |jstor=2025110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] objected that the concept of incommensurable scientific paradigms competing with each other is logically inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Davidson |authorlink=Donald Davidson (philosopher) |title=On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme |journal=[[Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association]] |url=http://files.meetup.com/328570/davidson_on-the-very-idea.pdf |year=1973-1974 |volume=47 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.2307/3129898 |jstor=3129898}} In 1984, the essay became [https://books.google.com/books?id=4d9rAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22On+the+Very+Idea+of+a+conceptual+Scheme%22 chapter 13 (pp. 183–198)] of [https://books.google.com/books?id=4d9rAAAAIAAJ ''Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation''], [[Clarendon Press]], {{ISBN|0-198-75046-3}}; {{ISBN|978-0-198-75046-8}}.

===Incommensurability and perception===
The close connection between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is at the root of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient ''conceives'' the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jerry A. Fodor |last=Ferretti |first=F. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Editori Laterza |location=Rome |isbn=88-420-6220-0 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Fodor]] attempts to establish that this theoretical paradigm is fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Turn: Sociological and Psychological Perspectives on Science|last=de Gelder|first=Beatrice|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=1989|isbn=978-0-7923-0306-0|series=Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook|volume=13|pages=97–100|chapter=Granny, The Naked Emperor and the Second Cognitive Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In epistemology, for example, the criticism of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which [[naïve physics]] is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then it is possible to maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is that it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.

Other critics, such as [[Israel Scheffler]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Saul Kripke]], have focused on the [[Frege]]an distinction between sense and reference in order to defend [[scientific realism]]. Scheffler contends that Kuhn confuses the meanings of terms such as "mass" with their [[referent]]s. While their meanings may very well differ, their [[referent]]s (the objects or entities to which they correspond in the external world) remain fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Subjectivity|last=Scheffler|first=Israel|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|year=1982|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK Household Longitudinal Study''' ('''UKHLS''') is now known as '''Understanding Society'''.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/|title=Homepage: understandingsociety.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest [[panel study|panel survey]] in the world, supporting social and economic research. Its sample size is 40,000 households from the [[United Kingdom]] or approximately 100,000 individuals.

==Structure==
Data collection, or fieldwork, began in January 2009 and the plan is to follow and interview annually the members of the original households (and their newly formed households, if applicable). The fieldwork period is 24 months, but each person is still interviewed annually, i.e., the fieldwork for consecutive waves overlap.

The study is mainly funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], and led by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.iser.essex.ac.uk Iser.essex.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Essex]].

As a [[panel study|panel survey]], Understanding Society is a form of [[longitudinal study]] which means that the survey consists of information about the same individuals at regular intervals and so can be used to track changes in people's lives and attitudes over time. It can also be used to measure phenomena such as poverty persistence, unemployment duration, duration of marriage or cohabitation and analyze the factors that affect these durations. The study allows for deeper analysis of a wide range of sections of the population as they respond to regional, national and international change. Understanding Society will enhance our insight into the pathways that influence peoples longer term occupational trajectories; their health and well-being, their financial circumstances and personal relationships.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

From its second wave (starting in 2010) onwards the ''Understanding Society'' incorporates the [[British Household Panel Survey]], which has been carried out at ISER&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"/&gt; since 1991.

The ''Understanding Society'' is one of the first longitudinal surveys in UK to put ethnicity at the heart of the survey and include an ''Ethnic Minority Boost Sample'' (approximately 1000 adults from each of the five main ethnic minority groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African plus members of other minorities as identified in the screening).&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study will capture biomedical data on 20,000 participants and place this alongside rich social histories, helping us weigh the extent to which people's environment influences their health relative to their genetic make-up.

This study also consists of a methodological survey called the ''Innovation Panel'' which is conducted in the year prior to the main survey to enable research in key methodological issues such as the quality of new questions, methods to improve response rates, mode effects. This sample consists of 1500 households.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study hosts a ''biennial conference''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2014/12/08/call-for-abstracts-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Urbino European Law Seminar''''' is a summer course organized every year since 1959 by the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino. The lectures are held in French, Italian and English at the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]], by visiting lecturers from many European countries and focus on current issues of [[European law]], [[private international law]], [[comparative law]] and Italian law. 

Following the seminar, participants are given a certificate as proof of their attendance. Depending on the specialty selected&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-paris1.fr/uploads/media/Certificate.and.diplomas.pdf Regulation of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino.]&lt;/ref&gt; and if successful in examination, participants are also awarded a diploma from the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]] in either comparative law, European studies, advanced studies in European Law, or advanced European studies.

== History ==
The Urbino European Law Seminar was inaugurated on the 24th of August 1959&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ridc_0035-3337_1959_num_11_4_11303 Report of the inaugural session] : [S.N.], «"Corsi estivi" de la Faculté de droit de l'Université d'Urbino», ''Revue internationale de droit comparé'', 1959, pp. 550-751.&lt;/ref&gt; by Henri Batiffol, Phocion Francescakis, Alessandro Migliazza, Francesco Capotorti, Enrico Paleari and Germain Bruillard. Until 2004, [[Cino Del Duca|Cino]] and [[Simone Del Duca]] were the seminar's main benefactors. Since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/news/consulting_public/0002/contributions/civil_society_ngo_academics_others/university_of_urbino_groupe_galileo_fr.pdf Response of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino and the Galileo Initiative to the European Commission's Green Paper on the Revision of the «Brussels I» Regulation], on the «Justice, Freedom and Security» General Division of the European Commission's website.&lt;/ref&gt; the teachers and researchers of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino, members of the ''Galileo Group'', receive funding from the scientific cooperation initiative between France and Italy named Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144245/http://www.universite-franco-italienne.org/appel+a+projets-fr-24-programme+galilee.html Presentation of the Galileo Initiative] on the website of the Franco-Italian University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.

Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V.

Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D.
