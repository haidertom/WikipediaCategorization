'''''Anxiety''''' ({{lang-no|'''Angst'''}}) is an oil-on-canvas painting created by the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] artist [[Edvard Munch]] in 1894. It's currently housed in [[Munch Museum]] in Oslo, Norway. Many art critics{{who|date=January 2015}} feel that ''Anxiety'' is closely related to Munch’s more famous piece, ''[[The Scream]]''. The faces show despair and the dark colors show a depressed state. Many critics also believe it’s meant to show the emotions of [[Broken heart|heartbreak]] and sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://totallyhistory.com/anxiety/ Anxiety ]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], ''[[Goethe in the Roman Campagna]]'', 1787, portrait of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], German artist known for his works of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, visual arts, and science.]]
An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of art and artists ==
&lt;!--

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3424">'''Bandamanna saga''' ({{IPA-is|ˈpantamanːa saɣa}}{{Audio|Is-Bandamanna saga.oga|listen}}) is one of the [[sagas of Icelanders]]. It is the only saga in this category that takes place exclusively after the adoption of Christianity in the year 1000.

The story starts with the relationship between Odd son of Ofeig and Ospak son of Glum; Ospak is the nephew of [[Grettir]]. Odd, with little help from his father, became rich and Ospak was known for his difficult character.  Ospak asks to live with Odd at the latter's home; Odd agrees because of Ospak's connections even though he is aware of the man's reputation.  Things go well until Odd wants to make a trading trip.  He has to talk Ospak into becoming his steward and priest, although Ospak actually wants to do those things.  While Odd is away, Ospak woos a rich woman named Svala and moves to her lands after a falling-out with Odd over the priesthood after Odd comes home.

Although everything went fine while Odd was away, after Ospak moves out Odd's animals start to go missing and Vali, who was raised by Odd's father and now lives with Odd, promises to find out if Ospak stole them as Odd suspects.  Vali tells Ospak that he is suspected, and is killed later when he and Odd visit Ospak's home by mistake for Odd. Odd tries to bring Ospak to trial but makes a legal mistake and fails.

Going home disappointed, Odd meets his father, who promises to take on the case if paid what Odd would have paid anybody else who could have fixed things.  Ofeig gets the jurymen to agree to do what they want to do, condemn somebody as infamous as Ospak, and get paid into the bargain, in spite of the [[legal technicality]].

The bribe is suspected by Thorarin, father of Ospak's wife, and his friend Styrmir, and they form a band and swear an oath with six other men to take Odd to court and hopefully fine him of all his money.

The rest of the story is about Ofeig's handling of the case and its outcome. Ofeig, very skillfully, convinces two of the other six men conspiring against Odd (the six men being known as the "Confederates") into helping them instead with even more bribery, convincing them that they will get no money because Odd is already gone, that they will look like embarrassed fools when they are caught and promises one of them that Odd will marry one of their daughters (works out for Odd). They agree and Ofeig convinces the court that if they are allowed one thing in this court case (where 6 (the Confederates) against 1 (Odd) is unconventional) it is that at least Ofeig can choose 2 of the men within the Confederates to decide the case and punishment. As previously agreed by Ofeig and the 2 men, they find him guilty but charge him very minimally. Thus, they (the two Confederates) do not break their oaths with the other Confederates and still get money. All parties but the remaining conspirators win.

'''The Bongy Westphall Universe''' is a fictional universe of 44 related films released by [[Full Moon Entertainment]]. Series creator [[Charles Band]] took inspiration from team up comics he read as a child.&lt;ref name=yell&gt;{{cite web|title=Band, Charles Band: Our Exclusive Interview Explores His Fears and Future with Full Moon|url=http://www.yellmagazine.com/charles-band-interview/25686/2/|publisher=Yell!|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is named after the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]] and also the film [[Evil Bong]] which presents the largest crossover in the fictional universe. The named was coined by film podcast [[Double Feature (podcast)|Double Feature]] during their "Killapalooza" episode highlighting the [[Puppet Master (series)|Puppet Master]] franchise.&lt;ref name="DF#1"&gt;{{cite podcast|title=Killapalooza 24: Puppet Master|publisher=Double Feature|url=https://doublefeature.fm/2014/killapalooza-24-puppet-master|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Crossovers ==

=== Evil Bong ===

Evil Bong represents the largest overall crossover in the Bongy Westphall universe. Ooga Booga ([[Blood Dolls]]), Ivan Burroughs ([[Decadent Evil]]), [[Gingerdead Man]], Jack Attack ([[Demonic Toys]]), and Jack Deth ([[Trancers]]) are all featured.

=== Decadent Evil ===

Footage from [[Subspecies (film series)|Vampire Journals]] is used at the beginning of the movie which ties the [[Subspecies (film series)|Subspecies]] series to the Bongy Westphall Universe.

=== Dollman vs. Demonic Toys ===

Jack Attack's appearance in Evil Bong brings Demonic Toys into the Bongy Westphall Universe. The Dollman crossover also incorporates [[Bad Channels]] due to a small Dollman cameo.

=== Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys ===

By crossing over with Demonic Toys, all ten other [[Puppet Master (film series)|Puppet Master films]] are entered into the Bongy Westphall Universe although Puppet Master never crosses over directly with Evil Bong.

=== miscellaneous ===

[[Zombies Vs. Strippers]] (2012): The character Hambo (played by [[Chance A. Rearden]]) later appears in Ooga Booga and several Gingerdead Man films.

[[Crash and Burn (1990 film)|Crash and Burn]] (1990): The character Quinn (played by [[Bill Moseley]]) later appears in Evil Bong (2006).

The '''Brown Lady of Raynham Hall''' is a [[ghost]] that reportedly haunts [[Raynham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]], England. 
It became one of the most famous hauntings in [[Great Britain]] when photographers from ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine claimed to have captured its image. The "Brown Lady" is so named because of the brown [[brocade]] dress it is claimed she wears.

==Identity of the ghost==
[[File:Lady Dorothy Walpole.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Lady Dorothy Walpole by [[Charles Jervas]]]]
According to legend, the "Brown Lady of Raynham Hall" is the ghost of [[Dorothy Townshend|Lady Dorothy Walpole]] (1686–1726), the sister of [[Robert Walpole]], generally regarded as the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]]. She was the second wife of [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]], who was notorious for his violent temper. The story says that when Townshend discovered that his wife had committed [[adultery]] with [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton|Lord Wharton]] he punished her by locking her in her rooms in the family home, Raynham Hall. According to [[Mary Wortley Montagu]], Dorothy was in fact entrapped by the Countess of Wharton. She invited Dorothy over to stay for a few days knowing that her husband would never allow her to leave, not even to see her children. She remained at Raynham Hall until her death in 1726 from [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Lady of Raynham|url=http://home.worldonline.co.za/~townshend/dorothywalpole.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sightings==
The first recorded claim of a sighting of the ghost was by Lucia C. Stone concerning a gathering at [[Raynham Hall]] in the Christmas of 1835. Stone says that Lord Charles Townshend had invited various guests to the Hall, including a Colonel Loftus, to join in the Christmas festivities. Loftus and another guest named Hawkins said they had seen the "Brown Lady" one night as they approached their bedrooms, noting in particular the dated brown dress she wore. The following evening Loftus claimed to have seen the "Brown Lady" again, later reporting that on this occasion he was drawn to the spectre's empty eye-sockets, dark in the glowing face. Loftus' sightings led to some staff permanently leaving Raynham Hall.&lt;ref name=Mysterious&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/england/norfolk/hauntings/the-brown-lady-of-raynham-hall.html# |title=Parkinson, Daniel ''Mysterious Britain &amp; Ireland'' website |access-date=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052925/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/england/norfolk/hauntings/the-brown-lady-of-raynham-hall.html# |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.castleofspirits.com/brownlady.html# |title=Brown Lady of Raynham Hall - Castle of Spirits |access-date=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085649/http://www.castleofspirits.com/brownlady.html# |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frederick Marryat by John Simpson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Marryat]] claimed to have seen the ''Brown Lady'' in 1836]]

The next reported sighting of the "Brown Lady" was made in 1836 by Captain [[Frederick Marryat]], a friend of [[novel]]ist [[Charles Dickens]], and the author of a series of popular sea novels. It is said that Marryat requested that he spend the night in the haunted room at Raynham Hall to prove his theory that the haunting was caused by local smugglers anxious to keep people away from the area. Writing in 1891, [[Florence Marryat]] said of her father's experience:

{{Quote|…he took possession of the room in which the portrait of the apparition hung, and in which she had been often seen, and slept each night with a loaded revolver under his pillow. For two days, however, he saw nothing, and the third was to be the limit of his stay. On the third night, however, two young men (nephews of the baronet), knocked at his door as he was undressing to go to bed, and asked him to step over to their room (which was at the other end of the corridor), and give them his opinion on a new gun just arrived from London. My father was in his shirt and trousers, but as the hour was late, and everybody had retired to rest except themselves, he prepared to accompany them as he was. As they were leaving the room, he caught up his revolver, “in case you meet the Brown Lady,” he said, laughing. When the inspection of the gun was over, the young men in the same spirit declared they would accompany my father back again, “in case you meet the Brown Lady,” they repeated, laughing also. The three gentlemen therefore returned in company.

The corridor was long and dark, for the lights had been extinguished, but as they reached the middle of it, they saw the glimmer of a lamp coming towards them from the other end. “One of the ladies going to visit the nurseries,” whispered the young Townshends to my father. Now the bedroom doors in that corridor faced each other, and each room had a double door with a space between, as is the case in many old-fashioned houses. My father, as I have said, was in shirt and trousers only, and his native modesty made him feel uncomfortable, so he slipped within one of the ''outer'' doors (his friends following his example), in order to conceal himself until the lady should have passed by.

I have heard him describe how he watched her approaching nearer and nearer, through the chink of the door, until, as she was close enough for him to distinguish the colors and style of her costume, he recognised the figure as the facsimile of the portrait of “The Brown Lady”. He had his finger on the trigger of his revolver, and was about to demand it to stop and give the reason for its presence there, when the figure halted of its own accord before the door behind which he stood, and holding the lighted lamp she carried to her features, grinned in a malicious and diabolical manner at him. This act so infuriated my father, who was anything but lamb-like in disposition, that he sprang into the corridor with a bound, and discharged the revolver right in her face. The figure instantly disappeared - the figure at which for several minutes ''three'' men had been looking together – and the bullet passed through the outer door of the room on the opposite side of the corridor, and lodged in the panel of the inner one. My father never attempted again to interfere with "The Brown Lady of Raynham".&lt;ref&gt;Marryat, Florence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c7ZbA6W5w-AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=florence+Marryat+there+is+no+death&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=tIfrTOKsDoiAhAfj6smsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false There Is No Death]'' First published in 1917 by David McKay. New edition published by Cosimo, Inc (2004) pg. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lady Townshend reported that the "Brown Lady" was next seen in 1926, when her son and his friend claimed to have seen the ghost on the staircase, identifying the ghostly figure with the portrait of Lady Dorothy Walpole which then hung in the haunted room.

==''Country Life'' magazine==
[[Image:Raynham Hall.jpg|thumb|Raynham Hall]]
On September 19, 1936 Captain Hubert C. Provand, a London-based photographer working for ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, and his assistant, Indre Shira, were taking photographs of Raynham Hall for an article. They claim that they had already taken a photograph of the Hall's main staircase and were setting up to take a second when Shira saw "a vapoury form gradually assuming the appearance of a woman" moving down the stairs towards them.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Under Shira's direction Provand quickly took the cap off the lens while Shira pressed the trigger to activate the camera's flash. Later, when the negative was developed, the famous image of the "Brown Lady" was revealed. The account of Provand and Shira's ghostly experience at Raynham Hall was published in ''Country Life'' magazine on December 26, 1936 along with the photograph of the Brown Lady.&lt;ref name=Mysterious/&gt;&lt;ref name=Life&gt;''Country Life'' magazine 26 December 1936&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph and the account of its taking also appeared in the January 4, 1937 edition of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Myst&gt;[http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/column.php?id=183215 'The Camera Never Lies?'] Forde, Matt on Unexplained Mysteries website&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shortly thereafter, the noted [[paranormal]] investigator [[Harry Price]] interviewed Provand and Shira and reported, "I will say at once I was impressed. I was told a perfectly simple story: Mr. Indre Shira saw the apparition descending the stairs at the precise moment when Captain Provand’s head was under the black cloth. A shout – and the cap was off and the flashbulb fired, with the results which we now see. I could not shake their story, and I had no right to disbelieve them. Only collusion between the two men would account for the ghost if it is a fake. The negative is entirely innocent of any faking."&lt;ref name=Myst/&gt;

==Skeptical reception==

Some critics have claimed that Shira faked the image by putting grease or a similar substance on the lens in the shape of a figure, or moved down the stairs himself during an exposure. Others claim that the image is an accidental [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] or that light somehow got into the camera.&lt;ref name=Mysterious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article1967261.ece "Ultimate proof that ghosts exist, or maybe it's just dust on the lens"]. Wade, Mike. ''[[The Times]]''. March 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]] has written that a detailed examination of the photograph shows evidence of double exposure.&lt;ref&gt;
Nickell, Joe. (2008). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photoghosts_images_of_the_spirit_realm "Photoghosts: Images of the Spirit Realm?"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; John Fairley and Simon Welfare wrote "there is a pale line above each [[Stair tread|stair-tread]], indicating that one picture has been superimposed over the other; a patch of reflected light at the top of the right-hand banister appears twice."&lt;ref&gt;Fairley, John; Welfare, Simeon. (1987). ''Arthur C. Clarke’s Chronicles of the Strange and Mysterious''. Collins. p. 140. {{ISBN|0-00-217618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] wrote the photograph could easily be duplicated by naturalistic methods. Booth had the magician Ron Wilson cover himself in a bed sheet and descend the grand staircase at [[The Magic Castle]] in Hollywood. The faked ghost image looked very similar to the Raynham Hall photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, John. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. pp. 108-109. {{ISBN|0-87975-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics point out that the image of the lady very closely resembles that of a standard Virgin Mary statue as would be found in any Catholic church, the light patch covering the bottom one third of the image, resembling an inverted "V" shape, being very indicative, as the outer garment above it drapes down on either side at an angle. Also the head is covered and the hands appear to be together as in prayer, and the square or rectangular pedestal on which she stands is also clearly visible. This strongly suggests that the photo is a simple superimposition of the Madonna statue onto the empty staircase.&lt;ref&gt;"Ghost Haunts" (2008) http://www.ghosthaunts.com/raynham_brown_lady.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charge conjugation''' is a transformation that switches all particles with their corresponding antiparticles, and thus changes the sign of all [[charge (physics)|charges]]: not only [[electric charge]] but also the charges relevant to other forces.   In [[physics]], '''C-symmetry''' means the symmetry of physical laws under a charge-conjugation [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]. Electromagnetism, gravity and the strong interaction all obey C-symmetry, but [[weak interaction]]s violate C-symmetry.

==Charge reversal in electroweak theory==
The laws of [[electromagnetism]] (both [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum]]) are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under this transformation: if each charge ''q'' were to be replaced with a charge &amp;minus;''q'', and thus the directions of the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s were reversed, the dynamics would preserve the same form. In the language of [[quantum field theory]], charge conjugation transforms:&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peskin, M.E.  |author2=Schroeder, D.V.|title=An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1997|isbn=0-201-50397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# &lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow -i(\bar\psi \gamma^0 \gamma^2)^T&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \rightarrow -i(\gamma^0 \gamma^2 \psi)^T&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;A^\mu \rightarrow -A^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these transformations do not alter the [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of particles. A left-handed [[neutrino]] would be taken by charge conjugation into a left-handed [[antineutrino]], which does not interact in the Standard Model. This property is what is meant by the "maximal violation" of C-symmetry in the weak interaction.

(Some postulated extensions of the [[Standard Model]], like [[left-right model]]s, restore this C-symmetry.)

==Combination of charge and parity reversal==
It was believed for some time that C-symmetry could be combined with the [[parity (physics)|parity]]-inversion transformation (see [[P-symmetry]]) to preserve a combined [[CP-symmetry]]. However, violations of this symmetry have been identified in the weak interactions (particularly in the [[kaon]]s and B [[meson]]s). In the Standard Model, this [[CP violation]] is due to a single phase in the [[CKM matrix]]. If CP is combined with time reversal ([[T-symmetry]]), the resulting [[CPT-symmetry]] can be shown using only the [[Wightman axioms]] to be universally obeyed.

==Charge definition==
{{main|C parity}}

To give an example, take two real scalar fields, ''φ'' and ''χ''. Suppose both fields have even C-parity (even C-parity refers to even symmetry under charge conjugation e.g., &lt;math&gt;C\psi(q) = C\psi(-q)&lt;/math&gt;, as opposed to odd C-parity which refers to antisymmetry under charge conjugation, e.g., &lt;math&gt;C\psi(q)=-C\psi(-q)&lt;/math&gt;). 

Define &lt;math&gt;\psi\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {\phi + i \chi\over \sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|χ}} have even ''C''-parities, and  the imaginary number ''i'' has an odd ''C''-parity (''C'' is anti-unitary). Under ''C'', ''ψ'' goes to ''ψ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''.

In other models, it is also possible for both ''φ'' and ''χ'' to have odd C-parities.

==History==
[[Roberto Longhi]] was the first to identify it as a fragment of the upper register of ''[[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|Death of the Virgin]]'' ([[Prado]]), probably for the private chapel of [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]] in the [[Castello di San Giorgio (Mantua)|Castello di San Giorgio]] in [[Mantua]]. At its base is the arch which links it to the main painting. The design and decorative scheme for Ludovico's chapel was Mantegna's first official commission - he became court painter in 1460, but negotiations to bring him to court had begun three years earlier. During the 16th century the chapel was rebuilt and redecorated, with the 15th century paintings and decorations removed, though the 16th century scheme itself was later destroyed. ''Death of the Virgin'' ended up in Ferrara, as shown by its appearance in a 1588 inventory listing it as among the paintings in the small private chapel of [[Margherita Gonzaga, Duchess of Ferrara|Margherita Gonzaga]], wife of [[Alfonso II d'Este]] - the part of the work showing Christ and the Virgin's soul may have been removed at this time to fit the work into its smaller new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Tatjana Pauli, ''Mantegna'', serie ''Art Book'', Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. {{ISBN|9788883101878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12261">'''Communication Aesthetics''' was devised by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] and [[Fred Forest]] at Mercato San Severino in Italy in 1983. It is a theory of [[aesthetics]] calling for artistic practise engaging with and working through the developments, evolutions and paradigms of late twentieth century communications technologies.  Observing the emerging supremacy of networks over subjects, it called for an artistic approach that was both adapted to, and invested in this changing techno-social arena.

==Background==

At the occasion of Artmedia, on Video Art organized by [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], Professor of Aesthetics at the [[University of Salerno]], Fred Forest had been invited to enact a performance and installation involving the Italian National Television Broadcaster (RAI).  The ensuing encounter revealed their mutual enthusiasm and interest in the evolution of the place of art in society given then developing communications technologies.  Following an evening of intense discussion they wrote and signed a manifesto with Argentinian artist Horacio Zabala acting as witness.  From the next day onwards, they established a list of artists whose practises reflected the artistic movement they had thus established.  As a result, [[Roy Ascott]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Stéphan Barron]], Marc Denjean, Natan Karczmar, Jean-Claude Anglade, Mit Mitropoulos, Christian Sevette, Robert X Adrian, Jean-Marc Philippe, Wolfgang Ziemer Chrobatzek, [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Eric Gidney, Ugo la Petria, Horacio Zabala, Daniel Dewaele and Piotr Kowalski expressed their alignment with the informal international group.  [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]], in direct communication with Fred Forest and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], then set up a Canadian group titled “Strategic Arts” responding to the same concepts and objectives and in which [[Norman White]] was involved.

Communication Aesthetics is currently intact, though for geographical reasons it is today broken up into three distinct spheres of thought, action and intercession:
* [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] holds positions and furthers action within the universities of Salerno and Naples in Italy
* while [[Fred Forest]] is active in France as professor at the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]] and currently the National Art School of Cergy, [[Sorbonne]] Paris 1
* and [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] upholds the North American connection as Director of the Marshall McLuhan programme at the [[University of Toronto]].

==Theory==

  | title = Pour une esthétique de la communication
  | journal = + - O
  | volume = 43
  | pages = 112

  | first = Fred
  | title = For an aesthetics of communication
  | url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/textes_critiques/textes_divers/4manifeste_esth_com_en.htm#text
  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Forest outlines the purpose of Communication Aesthetics:

“Electrical, electronic and computer technology have now brought us firmly into communication society. This technology is at the heart of changes tha that have come about in social reorganization over a century, thus modifying not only our physical environment but also our mental system of representation. Electricity, electronics and computers today provide artists with new instruments of creation. The way our surroundings are being transformed in this direction a little more each day, together with our continually evolving adjustment with an ever-changing reality, is doubtless what is most important. This is why we must constantly reconsider our perceptions in order to apprehend the world in which we live.”&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Communication Aesthetics claims that a concomitant evolution in technologies of communication and strategies in art would have democratized (and thus demystified) the means of artistic production thus replacing the purpose of art as material production with the purpose of art as social interaction:  “the artist now intervenes directly on reality, that is to say the carries out his symbolic and aesthetic activity using different means from those he has used up to now.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  But Communication Aesthetics pushing this position further, by calling for an interactive intervention on reality, one that plays with the spectator in both meanings of the phrase.

This play is in turn a form of power play as it questions the labelling and limitations of figures of authority.  The political ramifications of Communication Aesthetics are openly acknowledged by the founders, indeed they are called for: “In turn, the artist becomes a " social operative ", he becomes a social performer. The scaling down and the provocation of power, and its recuperation as a form of play, belong to the field of art. The responsible artist knows this power as his, and confronts the surrounding world with it.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

The socio-political position-taking goes further still, as the artists call for the recognition of the formative as well as informative nature of technology, and particularly information technologies: “It must be admitted once and for all that the history and genesis of the configurations of the imaginary are indelibly engraved in the "technologies" upon which our perception is utterly dependent - and thus today engraved in the "technologies" of communication.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  It is this analysis of the formal and functional aspects of communication that Communication Aesthetics calls for.

Communication Aesthetics pushes the psycho-physiological implications of technological innovations further still, elaborating on their concomitant modification of our concepts of Space and Time.  Just as the auto mobile changed our approach and experience of home and locality, so too Communication Aesthetics posited that IT innovations would change our approach to human interaction.  “The hooking-up of computers to each other, and also to other machines, is a fore-runner of the opening out of the telecommunications network and the abolition of certain constraints of distance.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;  And, once again, it is for the artist to understand and harness these modifications and constraints so as to engage with these evolutions in the name of communication:  “We can but remark that all these transformations brought about by media systems are, without our knowing it, reorganising our whole system of aesthetic representation.”&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

Lastly, Communication Aesthetics engages with another more problematic implication of technological innovations, the increasing intangibility of perception and sensuality resulting from the rise of the virtual.  Indeed, far from encouraging this lapse into asociality or asensuality, Communication Aesthetics seeks to frame these emerging problems rather than shy away from them.  Once again, Communication Aesthetics seeks to lay claim to societal relevance and influence by allying communications innovations and artistic innovations on the levels both formally and functionally.

"The goal of Communication artists is certainly not to produce first level meanings, but above all to make us aware as to how, in the end, the generalised practice of Communication interreacts on the whole of our sensory system. This evolution is about to put into place the data for a " new awareness " at the edge of our perception, and then, along with new " ways of feeling ", it will open up new aesthetic paths."&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">In a historical context, a '''covenant''' applies to formal promises that were made under [[oath]], or in less remote history, agreements in which the name actually uses the term 'covenant', implying that they were binding for all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One of the earliest attested covenants between parties is the so-called Mitanni treaty, dating to the 14th or 15th century BC, between the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]].

Historically, certain treaties and compacts have been given the name "covenant", most notably the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] that marked the [[Covenanter]]s, a [[Protestant]] political organization important in the [[history of Scotland]]. The term 'covenant' appears throughout Scottish, English and Irish history.

The term covenant could be used in English to refer to either the [[Bundesbrief]] of 1291, or the [[Pfaffenbrief]] of 1370, documents which led to the formation of the Swiss state or "[[Eidgenossenschaft]]". In this usage the German "''Eid''" is being translated as "covenant" rather than "oath" in order to reflect its written status.

'''''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''''' (or simply '''''Drood''''') is a [[musical theatre|musical]] based on the unfinished [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''.  It is written by [[Rupert Holmes]], and was the first Broadway musical with multiple endings (determined by audience vote). Holmes received [[Tony Awards]] for Best Book and Best Original Score.  The musical won five Tony Awards out of eleven nominations, including Best Musical and Best Leading Actor.

The musical debuted as part of the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] in August 1985, and, following revision, transferred to Broadway, where it ran until May 1987. Two national tours and a production in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]] followed.  The [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] revived the musical as ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://broadwayworld.com/article/Chita-Rivera-Leads-THE-MYSTERY-OF-EDWIN-DROOD-for-Roundabout-in-2012-2013-New-Productions-Announced-20120301 |title= ''Chita Rivera Leads The Mystery of Edwin Drood for Roundabout in 2012-2013'' |accessdate=2012-05-07 |work=BroadwayWorld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical ''Drood'' is derived from two major inspirations: [[Charles Dickens]]' final (and unfinished) [[novel]], ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', and the British [[pantomime]] and [[music hall]] traditions that reached the height of their popularity in the years following Dickens' death.

Dickens' ''Mystery'' began publication in 1870. The book, which had been written and published in episodic installments (as had most of Dickens' other novels) was left unfinished upon Dickens' sudden death from a [[stroke]] that year. The lack of resolution to the mystery (and the absence of notes that would indicate Dickens' intentions) have made ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' a literary curiosity. Almost immediately after the publication of Dickens' last episode, various authors and playwrights (including Dickens' own son) attempted to resolve the story with their own endings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/adaptations/39.html |title=''Some Early Dramatic Solutions to Dickens' Unfinished Mystery'' |accessdate=2007-09-03 |last=Allingham |first=Philip V. |work=The Victorian Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the time of the ''Drood'' musical's production, there had been several "collaborations" between the late Dickens and other novelists, numerous theatrical extrapolations of the material, and three film adaptations of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/drood/cinema.html |title= ''The Cinematic Adaptations of'' The Mystery of Edwin Drood:'' 1909, 1914, 1935, and 1993; or, Dickens Gone Hollywood'' |accessdate=2007-09-03 |last=Allingham |first= Philip V. |work=The Victorian Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneous with Dickens' writing, British pantomime styles — distinguished by the importance of [[audience participation]] and conventions like the [[principal boy]] — reached their height of popularity, just as music hall performance with its attributes of raucous, risque comedy and a distinctive style of music began to achieve prominence.

[[Rupert Holmes]], who would go on to be the major creative contributor to the musical ''Drood'', spent his early childhood in England.  At age three, he would experience theater for the first time when he was taken to a modern "panto", complete with cross-dressing lead boy and audience sing-alongs.  Some years later, as an 11-year-old boy fascinated by mystery books, Holmes first discovered the unfinished Dickens novel.  Both of those seminal experiences would go on to have a major impact on Holmes when he was first approached to write a new [[musical theatre|musical]] by impresario [[Joseph Papp]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rupertholmes.com/theatre/essdrood.html |title=''The History of'' The Mystery |accessdate=2007-09-02 |last= Holmes |first= Rupert |authorlink= Rupert Holmes |work= RupertHolmes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept===
Holmes, a well-known popular songwriter whose songs had been performed by the likes of [[Barbra Streisand]], and who had himself recorded the [[Hot 100 number-one hits of 1979 (USA)|#1]] hit [[Escape (Rupert Holmes song)|"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"]] in 1979, first became interested in writing a [[musical theatre|musical]] in 1983. Following a nightclub appearance during which Holmes performed some of his "story-songs" while sharing humorous anecdotes, Holmes received a note from Gail Merrifield, director of play development at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] (and wife of [[Joseph Papp]], the creator and head of the Festival), who had seen Holmes' performance and suggested that he write a full-length musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#evodrood | title=''Evolution of Drood as Musical'' |accessdate=09-02-07 | last=Freedman | first= Samuel G. | publication-date= August 28, 1985 | periodical= [[The New York Times]] | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on his recollections of [[pantomime]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] novel, as well as later experiences with Victorian-style [[music hall]] performance, Holmes conceived the central premises of the show. From the Dickens work, Holmes took the central plot and most of the featured characters.  From music hall traditions, he created the lead character of "The Chairman", a sort of Master of Ceremonies and instigator of the action on stage. And from pantomime he retained the concept of the "Lead Boy" (always portrayed by a young female in male drag) and the most ground-breaking aspect of ''Drood'', audience participation.

''Drood'' is unusual in part because of Holmes' feat of writing the book, music, lyrics, and full orchestrations for the show.  Though Holmes believed no Broadway creator had done this before,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Boasberg| first= Leonard W.| publication-date= June 7, 1986 | periodical= Knight-Ridder Newspapers | title= Wowing Broadway on 1st Try | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#wowing | accessdate=09-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite frequent mentions of this feat in articles and reviews of the show, the practice was not entirely uncommon in the early days of musical theater. Songwriters, including [[Adolf Philipp]], were previously credited with the books to their musicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=3910 Adolf Philipp's IBDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, none of these composer/librettists had written their own orchestrations as well.

In writing the book, Holmes did not let Dickens overshadow his own intentions. Rather than imitate Dickens' writing style, which he felt would be too bleak for the kind of show he wished to write, Holmes employed the device of a "show-within-a-show."  The cast members of ''Drood'' do not specifically play Dickens' characters, but rather music hall performers who are performing as Dickens' characters.  This device allowed for a great deal of light comedy that was not originally found in Dickens' novel to be incorporated into the show, as well as several musical numbers that were unrelated to the original story.  In explaining this decision, Holmes was quoted as saying, "This is not Nicholas Nickleby set to music--it's not a Dickensian work. It's light and fun and entertaining. But I hope--I think--that Dickens would have enjoyed it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Holden| first= Stephen| publication-date= June 1985 | periodical= [[The New York Times]] | title= Dickens Characters are Set to Music | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#oranges | accessdate=09-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes has also pointed out that "It has the same relationship to Dickens that ''Kiss Me Kate'' does to ''The Taming of the Shrew''." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Kilian|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pantomime concept also allowed Holmes to employ a female in the lead male role, which further allowed him to write a love song designed to be sung by two sopranos.

Most inventively, Holmes employed a novel method of determining the outcome of the play: having the audience vote for an ending. At a break in the show, the audience votes on who killed Drood (if, indeed, he was killed at all), the identity of the mysterious Dick Datchery, and on which two characters will become romantically involved in the end, creating a [[happy ending]]. Since every audience differs in temperament, the outcome is theoretically unpredictable even to the actors, who must quickly tally the votes and commence with the chosen ending (although some smaller companies will "fix" the results to limit the number of possible endings). This device required extra work from Holmes, who had to write numerous short endings which covered every possible voting outcome.

==Novel/musical differences==
There are several differences between the musical and the novel. The tone of Dickens' original book was somewhat bleak (as was Dickens' style), whereas the show is considerably more lighthearted and played for comedy.  The most notable difference in characterization involves Jasper: though Dickens' character is undoubtedly repressed and troubled, he is not depicted with the full-fledged [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] that he appears to have in the musical. Several minor characters are omitted, and the roles of others are expanded. In the musical, Bazzard is Crisparkle's assistant, whereas in the novel he is employed by Rosa's guardian, Mr. Grewgious.  Meanwhile, in order to increase the interactivity of the play and introduce doubt as to who the murderer is, the musical omits several of the novel's clues that Jasper is the killer and introduces clues which do not appear in the novel pointing at other suspects.

==Synopsis==
{{tone|date=October 2015}}

===Act I===
Act One opens as the members of the Music Hall Royale circulate among the audience, introducing themselves to the patrons. More and more members of the company add to the growing noise, until the music begins and the Chairman of the proceedings bursts forth with the show’s opening number "There You Are". They then introduce John Jasper, the 'Jekyll and Hyde' choirmaster who greets his young nephew Edwin Drood in the song "Two Kinsmen", where they express their strong friendship. Drood is engaged to the fair Miss Rosa Bud, who is Jasper’s music pupil and the object of his mad obsession. Rosa's suspicion of his obsession is confirmed when at her next lesson, he asks her to sing a song he has written- "Moonfall"- an innuendo-heavy love song from Jasper to her. The kindly Reverend Crisparkle and two exotic emigrants from Ceylon, Helena and Neville Landless, arrive. Neville is immediately attracted to Rosa, which makes him a rival to both Edwin and the secretive Jasper.

Next the chairman brings the audience to London and the sinister opium den of the Princess Puffer who talks with the audience, and explains her life in "Wages of Sin". A sinewy ballet dance follows. We discover that one of Puffer’s regular clients is none other than Jasper himself, who cries out the name 'Rosa Bud' during a hallucination. Puffer shows great interest in this fact, and stores it away in her memory. Back in Cloisterham, Neville and Drood meet and come to odds with each other almost immediately.

Next, The Chairman is called in to play another character as that actor is unable to come, but it turned out that the scenes of his character and the scenes of Mayor Sapsea coincide- and the characters have to disagree with each other. This results in major confusion for poor Mayor Sapsea/The Chairman, and laughs for the audience. He and Jasper sing of their conflicting minds- Jasper, of course, meaning it literally- in the patter song "Both Sides Of The Coin". We are then introduced to the drunken stonemason Durdles, and his assistant Deputy. In the graveyard, they tell us that Edwin and Rosa, who have been promised to each other since they were children and so cannot tell if they truly love each other, have called off their engagement ("Perfect Strangers"). As a parting gift, Rosa gives Drood her hair clasp, which once belonged to her mother.

It is Christmas Eve and Jasper has arranged a ‘reconciliation’ dinner for the Landless twins, Crisparkle, Rosa and Drood. In the resulting song "No Good Can Come from Bad", Neville and Drood's antagonism is reinstated, Helena's and Crisparkle's worry for Neville's reputation is shown, and it is revealed that Crisparkle used to be in love with Rosa's mother, who died after Rosa's birth. Soon the party disbands and the guests depart into a violent storm. There is a short halt here, where the actor playing Bazzard soliloquizes about how he never seems to be able to get a major part in a show in the song "Never The Luck".

The next day Drood has vanished. Crisparkle’s assistant discovers Edwin’s torn coat by the river. Drood was last seen walking there with Neville the night before. Nevile is almost lynched by the townsfolk before being rescued by Crisparkle. Jasper publicly swears to track down his nephew's killer; later he visits Rosa and confesses his love for her. She is horrified and angry, and they sing "The Name Of Love And Moonfall", ending with Jasper's pursuing Rosa off-stage as the act concludes.

===Act II===
Act Two begins six months later, and still there is no sign of Drood. There is much speculation as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems to be doing the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever.  However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is ''not'' chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff.  Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.

Puffer finds Rosa, reveals that years before she had been Rosa's nanny and tells her backstory in the song "Garden Path To Hell"; she tells of a man she loved who made her become a prostitute to please his friends and then left her. Once she lost her looks, she found a way to earn money- selling opium. She then continues with "Puffer's Revelation" and reveals the identity of Datchery (previously chosen by the audience.) The evening's Datchery (either Bazzard, Reverend Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, or Rosa) explains in their version of the revelation song "Out On A Limerick" why they donned the costume and tracked down the killer; the girls did it mainly to disguise their gender, Neville to prove his innocence, Crisparkle to help both Neville and Helena, and Bazzard to give himself both a dramatic reveal and an important character to play. The gist of each song is that the character followed Jasper to his house and found the clasp that Rosa gave Drood, which Jasper would have had only if he had taken it from Drood. Jasper's double nature reveals itself, and he admits that he strangled his nephew while under the influence of the laudanum that he reveals he poured into the wine the night of the dinner party ("Jasper's Confession").

Durdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he witnessed the crime and knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with "A Man Could Go Quite Mad", to admit his or her culpability; the gist of each of these songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill ''Jasper'', not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood for a while and then given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, to make sure that there is a twist).

Still, a happy ending is needed, and the Chairman asks the audience to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise "Perfect Strangers". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened on the night of his disappearance ("The Writing On The Wall"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined by the rest of the cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.

===Murderers===
'''John Jasper'''- Jasper was madly in love with Rosa Bud, and his violent split personality gladly killed Drood. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "Moonfall". Jasper's confession is performed no matter who is chosen as the murderer, and the audience is discouraged from voting for him since he is the obvious solution.  &lt;br&gt; 
'''Rosa Bud'''- Meant to kill Jasper in revenge for his lustful advances and also due to her own mental instability caused by Jasper's persecution, but killed Drood by accident as Drood was wearing Jasper's coat. Her confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" &lt;br&gt;
'''Neville Landless'''- Humiliated by Drood, Neville murdered him in order to regain his pride and also to have a chance with Rosa Bud. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject" &lt;br&gt;
'''Helena Landless'''- Knowing her brother's hot temper, Helena murdered Drood so Neville would not be tempted to seek revenge. Her confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject"  &lt;br&gt;
'''Princess Puffer'''- Intended to kill Jasper in order to protect Rosa from his advances, but accidentally killed Drood because he was wearing Jasper's coat and because she was confused after having smoked opium for [[Dutch courage]]. Her confession is a reprise of "The Wages of Sin" &lt;br&gt;
'''The Rev. Mr. Crisparkle'''- Crisparkle was madly in love with Rosa's mother, and he saw Rosa as a reincarnation of her. He murdered Drood so that he could marry Rosa, thinking her to be the woman he loved. This version of Crisparkle's confession was introduced in the first national tour, and has been used in all productions since. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject". &lt;br&gt;
'''Bazzard''' - In an effort to boost his role in the show, murders Drood.  This is definitely the most metatheatrical of the endings. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "Never the Luck" &lt;br&gt;
'''Durdles'''- After Jasper laid Drood in the crypt, Durdles believed the still-alive Drood to be a ghost and so smashed his head in.  (Even Durdles admits the silliness of this motive within his solo, but laments that because he has been chosen he must have one.) This solo was not used in the original Broadway production and was added for the first national tour. His confession is a reprise of "Off to the Races"

==Characters==
As ''Drood'' is [[metatheatre|metatheatrical]], the characters of the play ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' are played by actors of the "Music Hall Royale", within the production. The following are the dual roles each cast member plays. Note: The actress portraying Miss Alice Nutting/Edwin Drood also performs the role of Dick Datchery up until the Voting portion of the evening. However, as is noted in the script, this is merely a "bit" within the context of The Music Hall Royale - that Miss Nutting only portrays Datchery due to a contractual obligation for her to appear in both acts of the play. Ultimately, the audience decides who Dick Datchery is within the confines of Dickens' story.

*'''The role of Crisparkle was originally portrayed both in the readings and Delacorte production by the actor/playwright, [[Larry Shue]].''' When Shue died in a plane crash between the show's run at the Delacorte and its opening on Broadway, Rupert Holmes renamed the Music Hall Royale performer who portrayed Crisparkle from Wilfred Barking-Smythe to Cedric Moncrieffe, out of respect for Shue.

* Durdles is added as a possible murderer, and a "Murderer's confession" was composed for him, to the tune of "Off to the Races". The confessions of Neville, Helena and Crisparkle were rewritten to be reprises of "A British Subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamswitmark.com/shows/drood-the-mystery-of-edwin-drood/ "Tams-Witmark Website - The Mystery Of Edwin Drood"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
[[File:Drood.jpg|thumb|200px|Original cast recording]]
In 1985, a recording was made of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' featuring the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast.  This recording was released by [[Polydor]] with the additional subtitle, ''The Solve-It-Yourself Broadway Musical'' (Polydor 827969) and the CD included versions of "Out on a Limerick" by all five possible Datcherys (Rosa, Crisparkle, Bazzard, Neville, and Helena) and all six possible Murderer's Confessions (Puffer, Rosa, Bazzard, Crisparkle, Neville, and Helena), as well as an "instructional track" entitled "A Word From Your Chairman...."  The LP and cassette included only the opening-night Confession and murderer, and omitted the "lovers." A 1990 re-issue of the cast album by [[Varèse Sarabande]] (Varèse 5597) included two tracks, "Ceylon" and "Moonfall Quartet", that are on the original LP and cassette, but not on the CD. It included only Bazzard's version of "Out on a Limerick" and two Murderer Confessions (Rosa's and Puffer's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castalbumdb.com/title.cfm?TNumber=431 |title=The Mystery of Edwin Drood |accessdate=2008-09-01 |work=Musical Cast Album Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Polydor recording was briefly available on cassette and LP, and ultimately re-released by Varèse Sarabande.  Both versions of the cast album are currently out of print, but can sometimes be found (often at a high price) through secondhand vendors or online auction sites.

An Australian cast album (GEP Records 9401) was released in 1994.  This recording did not include "Ceylon" or "Moonfall Quartet", but did include three previously unrecorded tracks: "A British Subject", "Puffer's Revelation", and "Durdles' Confession". It should be noted that the Australian cast album was performed by a largely non-professional cast and used (arguably crude) midi sequencing in lieu of a live orchestra. Two songs that were omitted from ''Drood'' before it reached Broadway, "An English Music Hall" and "Evensong," (a duet between Rosa and Crisparkle) were later recorded for the 1994 album, ''Lost In Boston''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000014U4  |title=Lost in Boston: Songs You Never Heard From |accessdate=2007-09-02 |work= Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs that never made into the Broadway or London/'88 Tour (Tams-Witmark) versions include: "When the Wicked Man Comes" (sung by a much younger Deputy), "Sapsea's Song" (a music hall ditty for Mayor Sapsea),  "I Wouldn't Say No" (a song and dance routine for Durdles) as well as "When Shall These Three Meet Again" - a group number which can be heard as underscoring throughout the show and in the murderer's confession: "But the night was far from bright..."

On January 29, 2013, a recording featuring the 2012 cast of the Broadway revival was released by DRG Records in a 2-disc set&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Edwin-Drood-Broadway-Recording/dp/B00AX5HI6Q/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_2_1C09 |title=The Mystery of Edwin Drood (New 2013 Broadway Cast Recording): Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a digital download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Edwin-Drood-Broadway-Recording/dp/B00B83N1N6/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_1_1C09 |title=The Mystery Of Edwin Drood (The 2013 New Broadway Cast Recording): The New 2013 Broadway Cast Recording: MP3 Downloads |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DRG Records describes the recording as "the complete musical program on 2 compact discs" for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drgrecords.com/details.asp?pid=19883 |title=Cast Recordings, Broadway Cast Recordings, Broadway, New Releases, Film Soundtracks, Jazz, Cabaret |publisher=DRG Records |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724112806/http://www.drgrecords.com/details.asp?pid=19883 |archivedate=2014-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differences between this recording and the original recording include confessions from all eight possible murderers, two versions of "Out on a Limerick" (Bazzard and Helena), the lovers' reprise of "Perfect Strangers" (featuring a combination of Princess Puffer &amp; Deputy, Helena &amp; Neville, and Rosa &amp; Durdles), a revised "Ceylon" (which now incorporates "A British Subject"), a previously cut song ("An English Music Hall") as the new opening for Act II, and the "Opium Den Ballet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://castalbums.org/recordings/The-Mystery-Of-Edwin-Drood-2012-Broadway-Cast/26432 |title=The Mystery Of Edwin Drood &gt; Broadway Cast |publisher=CastAlbums.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes penned the liner notes for the album that will reflect new material and revisions. Holmes also re-orchestrated the production for a 19-piece orchestra led by [[Paul Gemignani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/172699-DRG-Will-Record-Broadway-Revival-of-The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood-on-Two-Discs |title=DRG Will Record Broadway Revival of The Mystery of Edwin Drood on Two Discs |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174714/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/172699-DRG-Will-Record-Broadway-Revival-of-The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood-on-Two-Discs |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
After Rupert Holmes wrote an initial draft that lasted three-and-a-half hours, and performed it, solo, for Joseph Papp, Gail Merrifield, and Wilford Leach, (the New York Shakespeare Festival's artistic director), Papp offered to produce the show as part of the Festival (also known as "Shakespeare in the Park"), and told Holmes that it would be immediately transferred to Broadway if it was deemed a success.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The original production of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' premiered in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Central Park]] at the [[Delacorte Theatre]] on August 21, 1985 after only three weeks of rehearsals. Notably, Holmes conceived most of the orchestrations himself, a rarity for a Broadway composer.

After the final Festival performance on September 1, preparations for the Broadway transfer (retaining the original cast) immediately got underway. Following a great deal of editing (the Delacorte version contained 32 original songs and was nearly three hours long)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Freedman|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]] on December 2, 1985.  Roughly halfway through the run, the title of the musical was officially shortened to ''Drood'' (the name it continues to be licensed under).  The show ran for 608 performances (not including 24 previews), and closed on May 16, 1987.  The Broadway production was produced by Papp and directed by Leach, with choreography by [[Graciela Daniele]].

The opening night cast of the Broadway production starred [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]], [[Cleo Laine]], John Herrera, [[Howard McGillin]], [[Patti Cohenour]], and Jana Schneider, who were all nominated for 1986 [[Tony Awards]] for their performances, as well as [[Betty Buckley]] in the title role. [[Donna Murphy]], [[Judy Kuhn]], and [[Rob Marshall]] were also members of the ensemble. (Marshall, who would later become best known as a choreographer and theater/film director, also received an early choreography credit as assistant to Daniele.)  Before the show ended its run, Murphy, who was understudy to Cleo Laine and Jana Schneider, took over the title role. Other notable replacements during the show's run included [[Alison Fraser]] (taking over for Jana Schneider), [[Paige O'Hara]] (taking over for Donna Murphy as Drood), as well as [[Loretta Swit]] and later [[Karen Morrow]], who stepped into Laine's roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4386 |title= The Mystery of Edwin Drood |accessdate=2007-09-02 |work= The Internet Broadway Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, several months after closing on Broadway, a slightly-revised version of ''Drood'', directed by Rob Marshall, began its first North America tour at the [[Kennedy Center]] Opera House in Washington, DC, with Rose, Schneider and O'Hara reprising their leads, and [[Jean Stapleton]] playing Laine's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#kilian | title=''Drood Hits the Road Without Missing a Beat'' | accessdate=09-02-07 | last=Kilian | first= Michael | publication-date= April 15, 1988 | periodical= [[The Chicago Tribune]] | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a break in the tour [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] returned to his home in the [[Dominican Republic]], and was murdered during his stay. Rose was succeeded by [[Clive Revill]]. 

The show, also enjoyed a 1987 [[West End theatre|West End]] run at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, a second U.S. national tour,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; a production at the [[Shaw Festival]] in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], [[Ontario, Canada]], and numerous regional and professional and amateur theatrical productions worldwide.&lt;ref name="holmessite"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rupertholmes.com/theatre/drood.html |title=''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' |accessdate=2007-09-02 |author= Holmes, Rupert |authorlink= Rupert Holmes |work= RupertHolmes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007–08, a London revival, presented as a chamber piece and directed by [[Ted Craig]], ran at the [[Warehouse Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/19290/the-mystery-of-edwin-drood Review of the Warehouse Theatre production]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a London West End revival of the musical played at the [[Arts Theatre]] for a limited season from 18 May. The cast was headed by [[Wendi Peters]] as Princess Puffer, with Natalie Day as Edwin Drood, Daniel Robinson as John Jasper and Victoria Farley as Rosa Budd. The production was directed by Matthew Gould.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droodwestend.com Edwin Drood | West End ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011650/http://www.droodwestend.com/ |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] presented a Broadway revival at [[Studio 54]], which opened in November 2012. The production was directed by [[Scott Ellis]], and starred [[Chita Rivera]] as Puffer, [[Stephanie J. Block]] as Drood, [[Will Chase]] as Jasper, [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as the Chairman and [[Gregg Edelmann]] as Crisparkle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13878/The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''] playbillvault.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flood Ladies''' were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic [[1966 flood of the Arno]] as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

==History==
Following the devastating flooding that damaged and destroyed cultural treasures of Florence, Italy in 1966, while those losses can never be replaced, the generosity of some of Italy’s most significant women artists of the 20th century as well as distinguished painters and sculptors from around the world brought donations of hundreds of notable creative works to the city.

In 2014 the City of Florence opened the "Museum of the 1900s" to showcase these works.

The story of the Flood Ladies was chronicled in the 2014 book "When the World Answered. Florence, Women Artists and the 1966 Flood" and the 2015 PBS documentary of the same name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">The '''French Intellectual Property Code''' ('''IPC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle''), is a corpus of law relating to intellectual and industrial property. It was formalised by Law No 92-597 of 1 July 1992, replacing earlier laws relating to [[industrial property]] and [[literary property|artistic and literary property]].

The code is frequently modified: two major modifications are known as the [[DADVSI law]] and the [[HADOPI law]].

'''''Frenzy of Exultations''''' (Szał uniesień), or better known as just '''''Frenzy''''' (Szał), is an 1893 painting by Polish artist, [[Władysław Podkowiński]], and is credited as the most famous work in his output. It is considered the first work of [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] in Polish art, during a period when [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|Poland]] was partitioned between its neighbours: Russia, Germany and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/12345/news |title=The Best of Polish Painting on Display in Poznań |newspaper=The Warsaw Voice news |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The painting shows a [[naked]], [[red hair|redheaded]] [[woman]] riding a black, frenetic [[horse]]. The horse reveals its teeth, and its tongue hangs out. Its nostrils are dilated and foam runs from its mouth. The woman riding the horse clasps its neck with her eyes closed, her loose hair fans out and flows upwards to mingle with the horse's mane. The canvas is over 3&amp;nbsp;meters in height, resulting in life sized figures. This painting is said to depict female [[orgasm]].

The colour range is quite narrow and is composed of blacks, browns and grays contrasting with the white and yellow. The image is divided into light and dark parts. The upper left corner is illuminated, directing attention to a clear figure of a woman and the horse's mouth. The right side of the painting shows whirled darkness in which the horse's hind and tail can be seen.

==Background==
The concept of this work dates back to Podkowiński's stay in [[Paris]] in 1889, but the emergence of successive oil sketches and charcoal studies in the second half of 1893 was the consequence of the growing drama of unrequited love in the artist's life. In his vision, Podkowiński elevates erotic ecstasy to an absolute value, regarding it, in accordance with the [[psychologism]] current for that time, as the cosmic power and determinant of the human condition. Setting about the execution of the huge painting, he employed the academic method of preparatory [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es that correspond to the final version, while differing slightly one from another in size and colour. Reduced in colour scheme, they range from the ultramarine version (lost), through work enlivened with green, to the subsequent ones, in which intense orange predominates. The avalanche of stones was removed from the final version as well. In comparison with the sketches, the final, monumental composition gained in dynamism and the previously weak contrast of colour intensified to that between golden and black, and the tension between light and shadow was more polarised. This could be an effect of his private life drama and the progress of his lung disease.

==History==
[[File:Kamieński-Podkowinski malujący Szał.jpg|thumb|''Władysław Podkowiński Painting "Frenzy"'' by [[Antoni Kamieński]], 1895]]
Podkowiński started to paint in [[Warsaw]] between 1893 and 1894. The creation process lasted at least three months, and according to a friend, the terminally ill Podkowiński "was painting from his bed" as he finished the work. The painting was shown at the [[Zachęta]] exhibition on 18 March 1894.&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trochimczyk|first=Maja|title=Paderewski in Poetry: Master of Harmonies or Poland's Savior?|journal=Polish Music Journal|date=Summer 2001|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/PMJ/issue/4.1.01/paderewskipoems.html|accessdate=22 March 2014|issn=1521-6039|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114942/http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/PMJ/issue/4.1.01/paderewskipoems.html|archivedate=23 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was accompanied by an atmosphere of sensationalism and scandal;&lt;ref name=PMJ/&gt; however, approximately 12,000 people saw the picture, earning nearly 350 [[ruble]]s for the gallery.

Despite the success of the painting, Podkowiński could not find a willing buyer: 3000 rubles were offered, but Podkowiński had asked for 10,000.

On the morning of 23 April 1894, 36 days since the exhibition's opening and just before its planned end, Podkowiński came to the exhibition and slashed the painting with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Różewicz|first=Tadeusz|title=Sobbing Superpower: Selected Poems of Tadeusz Różewicz|page=347|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XYpsUmnVfowC&amp;pg=PA347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this act are unclear.

Podkowiński's act of desecration may have contributed to the rumours that the image portrayed a woman towards which the artist had an unfulfilled affection. The damage of the image, and Podkowiński's death soon afterwards fuelled the speculation of his death being a suicide. Providing a rationale for this explanation are the traces of cuts on the canvas showing that only the image of the woman was subject to the attack. The object of the artist's feelings could be Ewa Kotarbińska, whom he met during his summer stay in a palace near Warsaw. She was a brunette, but some{{Who|date=August 2011}} record that her family saw a similarity between her and the woman in the painting and harshly condemned him.

After Podkowiński's death the painting was restored by Witold Urbański. The restored work was lent to other exhibitions in [[Łódź]], [[Kraków]], [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Finally, the canvas was purchased by Feliks Jasieński in 1901 for 1,000 rubles, and in 1904 was given to the [[National Museum, Kraków|National Museum in Kraków]].

[[File:Frigg by Doepler.jpg|thumb|Frigg sits enthroned and facing the spear-wielding goddess [[Gná]], flanked by two goddesses, one of whom ([[Fulla]]) carries her ''eski'', a wooden box. Illustrated (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Germanic mythology]], '''Frigg''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|ɪ|g}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frigg "Frigg"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Norse]]), '''Frija''' ([[Old High German]]), '''Frea''' ([[Langobardic language|Langobardic]]), and '''Frige''' ([[Old English]]) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god [[Odin]]. In Old High German and [[Old Norse]] sources, she is also connected with the goddess [[Fulla]]. The English weekday name [[Friday]] ([[etymology|etymologically]] Old English "Frīge's day") bears her name.

Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foresight and wisdom in [[Norse mythology]], the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god [[Odin]] and dwells in the wetland halls of [[Fensalir]], is famous for her [[Precognition|foreknowledge]], is associated with the goddesses Fulla, [[Lofn]], [[Hlín]], and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]], and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity [[Jörð]] (Old Norse "Earth"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god [[Baldr]]. Due to the significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess [[Freyja]].

After [[Christianization]], the mention of Frigg continued to occur in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives modern veneration in [[Germanic Neopaganism]].

==Etymology, ''Friday'', and toponymy==
The [[theonym]]s ''Frigg'' (Old Norse) and ''Frija'' (Old High German) are [[cognate]] forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''frijaz'' (via [[Holtzmann's law]]). *''frijaz'' descends from the same source ([[Proto-Indo-European]]) as the feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun ''priyā'' and the feminine [[Avestan]] noun ''fryā'' (both meaning "own, dear, beloved").{{sfnp|Orel|2003|p=114}} In the modern period, an [[Latin declension#First declension (a)|-a suffix]] is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form ''Frigga''.&lt;ref name=ASUFFIX&gt;See for example {{harvp|Bulfinch|1913|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]''.{{sfn|Sheard|2011|p=238}}

The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess [[Freyja]] with Frigg in the [[Common Germanic deities|Proto-Germanic]] period ([[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis]]) is a matter of scholarly debate.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}} The name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]]. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] *''[[Frijjō]]''. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse ''Freyja'' descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}}

Regarding a Freyja–Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

The English [[weekday]] name ''[[Friday]]'' comes from Old English ''Frīġedæġ'', meaning 'day of Frige'. It is cognate with [[Old High German]] ''frîatac''.{{sfnp|Simek|2007|pp=93–94}} Several [[toponymy|place names]] refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.{{sfnp|Pulsiano|Wolf|1993|p=503}}

===''Origi Gentis Langobardorum'' and ''Historia Langobardorum''===
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Godan and Frea look down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women in an illustration by [[Emil Doepler]], 1905]]
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards look up at Godan and Frea in an illustration by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
The 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', and [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' derived from it, recount a founding myth of the [[Langobards]], a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see [[Lombardy]]). According to this legend, a "small people" known as the ''[[Winnili]]'' were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Agio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the ''Origo''): "Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory."{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=315–16}}

Meanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that "at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked "who are those Long-beards?" Frea responded to Godan, "As you have given them a name, give them also the victory". Godan did so, "so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the ''Langobards'' ([[Lombardic language|Langobardic]] "long-beards").{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=316–17}}

===Second Merseburg Incantation===
[[File:Wodan Heilt Balders Pferd by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
A 10th-century manuscript found in what is now [[Merseburg]], Germany, features an invocation known as the [[Merseburg Incantations|Second Merseburg Incantation]]. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her—[[Fulla|Volla]], to assist in healing a horse:

===''Poetic Edda''===
In the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', the prose of ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Lokasenna]]'', and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]''.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=305}}

Frigg receives three mentions in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Völuspá''. In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son [[Baldr]] in [[Fensalir]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=8}} Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the "beloved of Frigg" and his future death is referred to as the "second grief of Frigg".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=11}} Like  the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied "first grief" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, [[Baldr]].&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON-266"&gt;See, for example, {{harvp|Larrington|1999|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frigg and Odin in Grímnismál by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The goddess Frigg and her husband, the god Odin, sit in Hliðskjálf and gaze into "all worlds" and make a wager as described in ''Grímnismál'' in an illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], 1895]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king [[Hrauðungr]], Agnar (age 10) and Geirröðr (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a [[Croft (land)|crofter]]. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirröðr. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirröðr aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}}

The boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirröðr, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said "go where an evil spirit may get thee."{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=18}} Away went the ship and Geirröðr walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirröðr was king. He "became a splendid man".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in [[Hliðskjálf]], "look[ing] into [[Norse cosmology|all the worlds]]".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} Odin says: "'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse ''[[gȳgi]]''] in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

Odin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her "waiting-maid" [[Fulla]] to warn Geirröðr to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirröðr was inhospitable with his guests, Geirröðr did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''. Geirröðr has Grímnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Grímnir is brought a full [[drinking horn]] by Geirröðr's son, Agnar (so named after Geirröðr's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

In the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where [[Loki]] accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by [[Ægir]]. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, "his wife", Frigg.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=84}}

===''Prose Edda''===
Frigg is mentioned throughout the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Frigg is first mentioned in the ''Prose Edda'' [[Prologue (Prose Edda)]], wherein a [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of [[folk etymology]], the author attempts to associate the name ''Frigg'' with the Latin-influenced form ''Frigida''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}} The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin "had the gift of prophecy".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}}

In the next section of the ''Prose Edda'', ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (the king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of [[Fjörgynn]] (Old Norse ''Fjörgynsdóttir'') is married to Odin and that the [[Æsir]] are descended from the couple, and adds that "the earth [''[[Jörð]]in''] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}} According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god [[Thor]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}}

[[File:Frigg and Fulla 1874.jpg|thumb|Frigg reaches into a box presented to her by a handmaid, [[Ludwig Pietsch]], 1865]]
Later in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Gangleri asks about the ''[[ásynjur]]'', a term for Norse goddesses. High says that "highest" among them is Frigg and that only [[Freyja]] "is highest in rank next to her". Frigg dwells in [[Fensalir]] "and it is very splendid".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}} In this section of ''Gylfaginning'', Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other ''ásynjur'': [[Fulla]] carries Frigg's ashen box, "looks after her footwear and shares her secrets"; [[Lofn]] is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to "arrange unions" among men and women; [[Hlín]] is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]] is sent by Frigg "into various worlds to carry out her business".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=29–30}}

In section 49 of ''Gylfaginning'', a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a [[thing (assembly)|thing]] and decided that they should "request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, [[Loki]] discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. The woman says that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that "Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; "there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of [[Valhalla|Val-hall]]. It is called [[mistletoe]]. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} Loki immediately disappears.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

[[File:Baldr's Death by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Frigg grips her dead son, Baldr, in an illustration by Lorenz Frølich, 1895]]
Now armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the Æsir are assembled and tricks the blind [[Höðr]], Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks "who there was among the Æsir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to [[Hel (location)|Hel]] and try if he could find Baldr, and offer [[Hel (being)|Hel]] a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=49}}

[[Hermóðr]], Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings&amp;mdash;foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=49–50}} Hermóðr locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Hermóðr Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Hermóðr rides back to the Æsir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a jötunn in a cave named [[Þökk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=50–51}}

Frigg is mentioned several times in the ''Prose Edda'' section ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the [[Æsir]] and Ásynjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, [[Asgard]]. Frigg is one of the twelve ásynjur in attendance.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=59}}

===''Heimskringla'' and sagas===
In ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', the first book of ''[[Heimskringla]]'', an [[Euhemerized]] account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers [[Vili and Vé]] oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the Æsir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, "but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.{{sfnp|Hollander|2007|p=7}}

In ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', the great king [[Rerir]] and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; "that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked".{{sfnp|Byock|1990|p=36}}

==Archaeological record==
A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the [[Schleswig Cathedral]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Northern Germany]]. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a [[distaff]]. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.{{sfnp|Jones|Pennick|1995|pp=144–45}}

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
{{main|Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis}}
Due to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and [[Freyja]] descend from a common entity from the [[Proto-Germanic]] period.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}} Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

Unlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]], the name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], as opposed to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Frijjō]]''. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which ''Freyja'' descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}}

==Modern influence==
Frigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, [[Gustav III of Sweden]], king of Sweden, composed ''Friggja'', a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and [[Hans Friedrich Blunck]]'s ''Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust'' in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (''Frigg, Freyja'', drawing, 1883), [[John Charles Dollman]] (''Frigga Spinning the Clouds'', painting, c. 1900),  [[Emil Doepler]] (''Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster'', painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (''Fricka'', drawing, date not provided).{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=94}}

[[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] appears in [[Marvel Comics]] and in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the queen of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wife of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], mother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the adoptive mother of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. 

The Finnish folk band [[Frigg (band)|Frigg]] takes its name from the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2012/09/finlands-frigg-uk-debut-tour/|title=Finland's 'Frigg' – UK Debut Tour – Folk Radio UK|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frigg.fi |title=Hot Fiddles from Cool Scandinavia |date= |accessdate=20 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412082933/http://www.frigg.fi/ |archivedate=12 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garghabazar caravanserai''' ({{lang-az|Qarğabazar karvansarayı}}) is a historic monument of XVII century. It is located in [[Qarğabazar, Fuzuli|Garghabazar village]], of [[Fuzuli District]], in [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The caravanserai was built in 1681 on a hill. It is known as Garghabazar caravanserai as it was built in Garghabazar village. The historic monument is sometimes referred as Shah Abbas caravansary. The architect of the monument is unknown, since inscription on the caravanserai is destroyed.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarayı (Füzuli)|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/museum/8ed5c332d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the occupation of Garghabazar village, the monument was ruined by Armenian forces.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarası - Füzuli rayonunun əsir abidələri|url= http://karabakhmedia.az/main/7072-qargabazar-karvansarasi-fuzuli-rayonunun-esir-abideleri-foto.html|publisher= karabakhmedia.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural features==

 [[File:Qarğabazar karvansarasının planı və kəsiyi.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Plan and cross-section of the caravanserai]]
According to its architectural style, Garghabazar caravanserai is similar to architectural traditions of Albanian  period.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The plan and architectural style of the caravanserai is made obedient to the general design by solving centered axis symmetrically. It consists of two large-sized [[Animal stall|camel stall]]s, two small rooms for guards on the right and left sides, 6 square-shaped rooms for caravanserai owner and merchants. The importance of these rooms is also reflected in the fact that they are built at the highest point of relief. Two high pavements were planted in front of these rooms according to their functions and relief.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

The width of the caravanserai is 23.67 meters in width and 34.70 meters in length. The main mass of the monument was built of unhewn stone. It is in a rectangular shape with a corner cut. On left and right sides of the entrance, in front of guard rooms, there are two large flagstones. It is considered that guards used to stand on those flagstones. The doors of the rooms are opening to a medium-sized balcony. The balcony is decorated 3 semicircular piers.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

There are special sewer lines in both halls of the caravanserai where camels were kept. This proves once again that in the Karabakh monarchy, sewage issues were still very much focused since ancient times.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

'''''Guardians of the Gate''''' is a 1991 Everdur [[bronze sculpture]] depicting a family of [[sea lion]]s by [[Miles Metzger]], located northwest of [[Pier 39]] and adjacent to the [[Embarcadero Center]] in [[San Francisco]], California, United States. The sculpture was dedicated on January 22, 1992 and was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program the same year.&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?print=yes&amp;q=siris_ari_308811|title=Guardians of the Gate, (sculpture)|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by Pier 39 Limited Partnership Beach Street and the Embarcadero Center.&lt;ref name=SOS/&gt;

''Guardians of the Gate'', which depicts a "nuzzling" male and female with a pup, was created in 1990 and cast in 1991. Metzger considers the sculpture one of his favorite pieces. He said of his work: "(My) sculptures mean to inspire, encourage and appreciate humanity and the natural world. The family (of sea lions) seemed such a beautiful, emotional moment."&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.auburnjournal.com/article/auburn-sculptor-carving-legacy-stone|title=Auburn sculptor carving legacy in stone|accessdate=July 26, 2013|date=February 28, 2012|work=Auburn Journal|first=Gloria|last=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger claims he knew that sea lions would be the subjects of his work upon learning the statue had been commissioned by the pier's owner. In 2012, he said of the sculpture's prominent placement: "I've been told by many people it is (one of the) most photographed pieces of sculpture in the United States. It's so populated in that particular spot. Everybody sees that piece. It's one of those places where you can sit on the sculpture and get your picture taken."&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

[[File:HWLX seals.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The seals at the back of the ''Hewu Longxiang'' qin]]

When the '''[[guqin]]''' is played, the modern name for a plucked seven-string [[China|Chinese]] [[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family, a number of '''[[aesthetic]]''' elements are involved. 

==Aesthetics==
The first aesthetic is [[musicality]]. In the second section of "Pingsha Luoyan", for example, the initial few bars contain a ''nao'' [[vibrato]] followed by a phase of sliding up and down the string, even when the sound has already become inaudible {{Audio|PSLY clip.ogg|Listen carefully to the sliding sounds of ''Pingsha Luoyan''}}. The average person trained in music may question whether this is really "[[music]]". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a "space" or "void" in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically "fills in the notes" with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. And since the music is more player oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. And with silk strings the sliding sound might be called the [[qi]] or "life force" of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.{{ref|aesthetics}}

In the music of the qin, we often come across (especially in harmonics) the use of the same note to two different strings. A good example of this would be in the main harmonic sections of "Meihua Sannong", where at the last three notes of the first two phrases all play sol (first sol on the sixth string at 7th hui, second on third string at 9th hui, then again on the sixth string at 7th hui) {{Audio|MHSN clip.ogg|Listen carefully to the two/three notes at the end of each phrase of the harmonic section ''Meihua Sannong''}}. The question would be why does one need to play the sol on the third string when one can play sol thrice on the sixth string. One reason is timbre; although both these two positions sound the same note, they sound different or have a different quality to them. Another reason is to add flavor during performance. We have other examples, like the first two phrases of ''Shenren Chang'', where the playing of the harmonics is on the left of the qin on the first phrase, then the same notes are played on the right of the qin. This adds symmetry to the play, and we often see this in many qin melodies where the same notes are mimicked in a different way. 

==Philosophy of the qin==
Qin music tends to linger on certain notes, with an emphasis on silence and timbre, giving it a [[meditation|meditative]] quality. Being an instrument historically associated with [[scholar-bureaucrats|literati]], its aim is [[Confucianism|Confucian]] (in trying to cultivate one's mind) as well as [[Daoist]] (in seeking harmony between man and nature). 「琴棋書畫」 (qin qi shu hua) refers to the [[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar]], wherein 『琴』 qin/music refers specifically to guqin. [This phrase is a rather late invention of the [[Song Dynasty (960-1279)|Song period]] (according to the ''Wuzhizhai Qinpu''), so it is not clear how essential it was to the pedagogy of earlier scholar classes]. It is rarely used to play popular and fast tunes which are deemed to be vulgar to the instrument of the [[scholars]]. 

Because of this, the qin is not so popular amongst the uninitiated, and because of the decline of its popularity in the periods of political disturbances (when the qin was seen as an [[elitist]] and [[feudal]] instrument. These days, the qin is referred to as a "[[Folk music|folk]] instrument" to move away from these connotations), very few people are familiar with it, even in China. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years, especially among [[Westerners]], as the qin embodies a [[philosophy]] which appeals to those who wish to escape the [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and confusion of the [[modern world]]. Some may argue that the spiritual side is one of the most appealing aspects of qin music, since much other music concerned with entertainment, social bonding or academic issues, the music of the qin offers a breath of fresh air, concerning with the individual and his/her connection with nature and surroundings. Of course, there is no reason why one cannot submit to a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] and/or [[idealistic]] view of the purpose of the qin music. It all depends on the player's preference of what s/he wants out of qin music. 

There is much comment in qin texts decrying "vulgar" music, but this really only means that there was much of it around. And it is interesting to hear people decry "popular and fast tunes" and then find out their favorite qin melody is ''Flowing Water''. By focusing only on what the scholars have idealized, people can miss a lot of the [[reality]] and [[beauty]] of pure music.{{ref|JT}} 

Some people (particularly the younger generation) find qin music difficult to appreciate upon first listening. The reason for this may be because they rate it against music that they only heard in their life, namely modern or [[popular music]]. Because qin music is very simple and plain ([[minimalist]], some{{Who|date=November 2011}} might say), they may find it boring when compared to the fast beat and sound saturated songs of the modern era. This can lead to a misunderstanding of the true nature of qin music and its aesthetic purposes. Perhaps some people's perceptions of qin music can be summed up in a quote:{{ref|Sachs}}

{{Quotation|[[western culture|Occidental]] listeners have great difficulty in perceiving the delicate shades of ch'in [qin] playing and in appreciating its spirituality. But the average [[Oriental]] cannot appreciate it either. The ch'in does not court popularity, nor does it suit [[Amateur|dilettantism]]. It is the instrument of philosophers and sages. In the privacy of a closed room, alone or before a few selected friends who listen respectfully and silently, the immaterial notes of the ch'in reveal to the listeners the ultimate truths of life and religion.|[[Curt Sachs]]|The History of Musical Instruments}}  

On the other hand, musicians and music lovers can easily appreciate qin music because they can hear music objectively and have a better understanding of music in an ethnomusicological context. 

There has also been a move to a more Western approach to qin music. A handful of professional players{{Who|date=November 2011}} prefer to look at the qin from a purely realist and scientific approach, treating the qin as a purely musical instrument, rather than a cultural phenomenon. This is due to some traditionalists treating the instrument as an 'other-worldly' object than a 'this-worldly' one. 
This move to a much more technical approach signifies a progression in qin study and appreciation; holding on to too much old values tends to impede the transmission of qin.{{Says who|date=November 2011}} An example would be composition. Although around 60-odd new compositions have been composed for the qin since the 1960s, all in all, no one plays them. The reason is that many{{Who|date=November 2011}} believe these new compositions do not compare with ancient scores. But technically, these ancient scores were new at the time when they were composed. Some{{Who|date=November 2011}} fear that in 100 years' time, people then might say that we{{Who|date=November 2011}} have contributed nothing new to qin. That is not to say that the qin cannot be viewed in a traditional way, but to say that the qin is also capable of a progression into new territory. There is no reason why players cannot embrace both traditional and scientific study of the qin.

==Manifestations of qin music==
{{wikisourcelang|zh|谿山琴况|"Xishan Qinkuang" 【谿山琴况】}}

In the past, written in a lot of literature, there is discussion and analysis of what is called ''shengjiang'' 〔聲像〕 or "manifestations of sound" of the qin. These are basically single words used to describe the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[theme (music)|theme]] of the piece. The number of these 'manifestations' are disputed. Some say only 4, some say 13-16,{{ref|shengjiang}} and some say over 24. Listed in some ''qinpu'' they have very lengthy descriptions of each manifestation, going into every detail. 

The most basic words used to describe qin music are, for example, Yushan school's ''qing'' 『清』, ''wei'' 『微』, ''dan'' 『淡』 and ''yuan'' 『遠』, or "pure", "profound", "light" and "distant". Another important essay on qin manifestations is ''Xishan Qinkuang'' 【谿山琴况】 which lists 24 qin manifestations in great detail.{{ref|qinman}} This essay has several layers; some words describe the playing method, some describe ornamentation and some describe the body of the music. They also explain the union between musician and instrument and how to achieve unity with the music.

'''Inti''' is the ancient [[Inca mythology|Incan]] [[solar deity|sun god]]. He is revered as the national [[Tutelary deity|patron]] of the Inca state. Although most consider Inti the sun god, he is more appropriately viewed as a cluster of solar aspects, since the Inca divided his identity according to the stages of the sun.&lt;ref name=conrad&gt;Conrad and Demarest 1984, pg.108&lt;/ref&gt; Worshiped as a patron deity of the [[Inca Empire]],&lt;ref name=inca /&gt; [[Pachacuti]] is often linked to the origin and expansion of the Inca Sun Cult.&lt;ref name="Steele &amp; Allen 2004, pg. 246"&gt;Steele &amp; Allen 2004, pg. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy 2003, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The most common story says that he is the son of [[Viracocha]], the [[god]] of [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Fash and Lyons, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends and history ==
Inti and his sister, [[Mama Killa]], the [[Moon]] goddess were generally considered benevolent deities. Mama Killa supposedly gave birth to their child. Their court is served by the Rainbow, the Pleiades, Venus, and others. The founding Inca ancestor, known as [[Manco Cápac]], was thought to have been the son of Inti.
According to an ancient myth, Inti taught his son Manco Cápac and his daughter [[Mama Ocllo]] the arts of civilization and they were sent to earth to pass this. Another legend, however, states Manco Cápac was the son of Viracocha.

Inti ordered his children to build the [[Inca]] capital where a divine golden wedge they carried with them would penetrate the earth. Incas believed that this happened in the city of [[Cusco]]. The Inca ruler was considered to be the living representative of Inti. [[Pachacuti]] is often linked to the origin and expansion of the Inca Sun Cult.&lt;ref name="Steele &amp; Allen 2004, pg. 246"&gt;Steele &amp; Allen 2004, pg. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy 2003, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Willaq Umu]] was the high priest of the Sun (Inti).  His position placed him as the second most powerful person in the kingdom. He was directly underneath the [[Sapa Inca]], and they were often brothers. The emperor and his family were believed to be descended from Inti.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;Bushnell 1957, pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

A great golden disk representing Inti was captured by the Spanish [[conquistadors]] in 1571 and was sent to the [[pope]] via Spain. It has since been lost.

==Worship==
[[File:Pachacuteckoricancha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Depiction of [[Pachacuti]] worshipping Inti in the [[Qurikancha]]]]
The Inca dedicated many ceremonies to the Sun in order to ensure the Sapa Inca's welfare.&lt;ref name=inca&gt;D'Altroy 2003, pg.148&lt;/ref&gt; The sun was also important to the Incas, particularly the people of the highlands, because it was necessary for the production of crops like maize and other grains.&lt;ref name=peru /&gt; The sun's heat was also thought to cause rain. During the rainy season the sun was hotter and brighter, while during the dry season it was weaker.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Allen 2004, pg. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt;

The Incas would set aside large quantities of natural and human resources throughout the empire for Inti. Each conquered province was supposed to dedicate a third of their lands and herds to Inti as mandated by the Inca. Each major province would also have a Sun Temple in which male and female priests would serve.&lt;ref name=inca /&gt; The female priests were the ''mamakuna'', who were chosen from the ''aqllakuna'' ("chosen women"), and they would weave special cloth and brew [[chicha]] for festivities and sacrifices to Inti.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy 2003, pg.189&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the chief temple of the Inca state religion was the [[Qurikancha]] in Cusco. Within this temple were wall niches in which the bodies of previous emperors and rulers were exhibited along with various statues of Inti in certain festivals. Some figures of Inti also depicted him in human form with a hollowed out midsection that was filled with a concoction made of gold dust and the ashes of the Inca kings' hearts.&lt;ref name=conrad3&gt;Conrad and Demarest 1984, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Inti is represented as a golden disk with rays and a human face. Many such disks were supposedly held in Cusco as well as in shrines throughout the empire, especially at Qurikancha, where the most significant image of Inti was discovered by anthropologists. This representation, adorned with ear spools, a pectoral, and a royal headband, was known as ''punchaw'' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] for day, also spelled ''punchao''). This image of Inti was also said to have lions and serpents projecting from its form.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez and George 2011, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The worship of Inti and the rise of the Inti cult are considered to be exploitations of religion for political purposes, since the Inca king was increasingly identified with the sun god. This grew into a form of divine patronage and the convenience of these comparisons for Inca emperors is crucial.&lt;ref name=suarez&gt;Suarez and George 2011, pg. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inti Raymi ==
[[File:Inti Raymi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Inti Raymi]] at [[Saksaywaman]], [[Cusco]]]]
The festival of [[Inti Raymi]] honors the sun god and was originally meant to celebrate the start of a new planting season.&lt;ref name=conrad2 /&gt; It now attracts many tourists each year to Cusco, which is &lt;ref name=inca2&gt;D'Altroy 2003, pg. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; the ancient capital of the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca Empire]]. The name of the festival, Inti Raymi, translates into "sun festival" &lt;ref name=conrad /&gt; and was held during the Southern Hemisphere's [[winter solstice]],&lt;ref name=inca2 /&gt; which is the shortest day of the year. This fell around June 24 in the Incan Empire.

This festival was attended by the four sectors of [[Tawantinsuyu]]. Military captains, government officials, and the [[vassal]]s who attended were dressed in their best costumes and carried their best weapons and instruments.

Preparation for the festival of Inti Raymi began with a [[Fasting|fast]] of three days, where there were no fires lit and the people abstained from having sexual intercourse. This festival would last for nine days, and during this time the people consumed massive amounts of food and drink.&lt;ref name=inca2 /&gt; There were many sacrifices as well, which were all performed on the first day. After the nine days everyone would leave with the permission of the Inca. 

== Sub-divisions of identity ==
Corresponding with the three diurnal stages of the sun, Inti's identity is also divided into three primary subcomplexes, which are the father, son, and brother. The first of these is Apu Inti ("supreme Inti"). He represents the father and is sometimes known as "The Lord Sun."&lt;ref name=conrad3 /&gt; The second is Churi Inti, or "Son Inti," who represents the son of Inti and is often known as "Daylight." The third and final division of Inti is Inti Wawqi ("Sun brother", or "Inti brother", also spelled ''Inti-Guauqui, Inti-Huaoqui''). Inti Wawqi also represents the sun god in his specific position as the founding father of Inca reign and the center of the state's official ancestor cult.&lt;ref name=conrad /&gt;

In astronomy, Apu Inti and Churi Inti can actually be separated from one another along an astronomical axis. This is because they are associated with the summer and winter solstices respectively. Inti Wawqi, however, is not associated with an astronomical location.&lt;ref name=conrad2&gt;Conrad and Demarest 1984, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
[[File:Flag of the race.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Flag of the Hispanic People|Hispanity]] with Inti rising behind the cross]]
The sun is also found on the [[coat of arms of Bolivia]] and [[coat of arms of Ecuador]], as well as the historical [[flag of Peru]]. All these three countries were historically part of the Incan Empire. It is also depicted on the [[Hispanic flag]].

The [[Sun of May]] has possibly its roots in Inti as well and can be found on the [[Flag of Argentina]] and [[Flag of Uruguay]].

'''''Jacques and November''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Jacques et novembre'''}}) is a 1984 Canadian [[drama film]] directed by [[Jean Beaudry]] and [[François Bouvier]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/126611/Jacques-et-Novembre/overview |title=Jacques and November |accessdate=17 November 2013 |work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[58th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars Beaudry as Jacques Landry, a man in his early 30s who is dying of an unspecified incurable disease and documenting his thoughts on mortality in a video diary; simultaneously, his friend Denis (Pierre Rousseau) is trying to make a higher-budget documentary film about him.&lt;ref&gt;"Movie within movie depicts dying days". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics largely analyzed the film not as focusing on death as such, but as an affirming and uplifting look at the meaning that friends and family bring to life.&lt;ref&gt;"Joyous ode to life in tale of dying man". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', May 30, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jacques Landry's terminal illness was not specified in the film, the LGBT magazine ''[[The Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]'' reviewed it as an [[HIV/AIDS]] allegory, directly comparing and contrasting its views of mortality with the contemporaneous HIV/AIDS-themed documentary film ''[[No Sad Songs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Learning to Talk Life and Death". ''[[The Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]'', November 1985. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The film was one of two selected for the Société générale du cinéma du Québec's annual awards, alongside [[André Melançon]]'s ''[[The Dog Who Stopped the War]] (La Guerre des tuques)''.&lt;ref&gt;"Quebec filmmakers share $200,000". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 18, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The award's prize consisted of a $100,000 investment in the production of the directors' next films.&lt;ref&gt;"Quebec directors vying for prizes". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 6, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a [[Genie Award]] nomination for [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Achievement in Music – Original Song|Best Original Song]], for [[Michel Rivard]]'s "Le temps nous dépasse".&lt;ref&gt;"Scorecard of major nominees for tonight's Genie Awards on TV". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 20, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Odin hrafnar.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Huginn and Muninn]] sit on [[Odin]]'s shoulders in this illustration from an 18th-century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript.]]
In [[mythology]], [[medieval literature]] and [[occult]]ism, the '''language of the birds''' is postulated as a mystical, perfect [[divine language]], [[language of the birds#Alchemy|green language]], [[adamic language]], [[Enochian]], [[Angel|angelic language]] or a [[Mythical origins of language|mythical]] or magical language used by [[bird]]s to communicate with the initiated.

==History==
In [[Indo-European religion]], the behavior of birds has long been used for the purposes of [[divination]] by [[augur]]s. According to a suggestion by [[Walter Burkert]], these customs may have their roots in the [[Paleolithic]] when, during the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], early humans looked for [[carrion]] by observing scavenging birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Company of Crows and Ravens |last=Marzluff |first=John M. |author2=Tony Angell  |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-12255-1 |pages=284–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also examples of contemporary bird-human communication and [[symbiosis]]. In North America, ravens have been known to lead wolves (and native hunters) to prey they otherwise would be unable to consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Tracks and Scats |last=McDougall |first=Len |year=2004 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=1-59228-070-6 |page=296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwp.mt.gov/news/newsReleases/headlines/nr_1762.html |title=Raven Myths May Be Real |accessdate=2017-10-29 |last=Tipton |first=Diane |date=2006-07-06 |publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, the [[greater honeyguide]] is known to guide humans to beehives in the hope that the hive will be incapacitated and opened for them.

Dating to the [[Renaissance]], birdsong was the inspiration for some [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al [[engineered language]]s, in particular [[musical language]]s. [[Whistled language]]s based on spoken natural languages are also sometimes referred to as the language of the birds. Some [[language games]] are also referred to as the language of birds, such as in [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Amharic]] of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Kebbede Hordofa and Peter Unseth. 1986. "Bird Talk" in Oromo. ''Quaderni di Studi Etiopici'' 6-7:74-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian language is known as "nightingale speech" amongst its speakers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Mythology===

====Norse mythology====
In [[Norse mythology]], the power to understand the language of the birds was a sign of great wisdom. The god [[Odin]] had two ravens, called [[Hugin and Munin]], who flew around the world and told Odin what happened among mortal men.

The legendary [[king of Sweden]] [[Dag the Wise]] was so wise that he could understand what birds said. He had a tame [[house sparrow]] which flew around and brought back news to him. Once, a farmer in [[Reidgotaland]] killed Dag's sparrow, which brought on a terrible retribution from the Swedes.

In the ''[[Rígsþula]]'', Konr was able to understand the speech of birds. When Konr was riding through the forest hunting and snaring birds, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would win more if he stopped hunting mere birds and rode to battle against foemen.

The ability could also be acquired by tasting dragon blood. According to the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', [[Sigurd]] accidentally tasted dragon blood while roasting the heart of [[Fafnir]]. This gave him the ability to understand the language of birds, and his life was saved as the birds were discussing [[Regin]]'s plans to kill Sigurd. Through the same ability [[Áslaug]], Sigurd's daughter, found out the betrothment of her husband [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], to another woman.

[[File:Sigurd.svg|thumb|240px|right|The 11th century Ramsund carving in Sweden depicts how [[Sigurd]] learnt the language of birds, in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the [[Völsunga saga]]]]
The 11th century [[Ramsund carving]] in [[Sweden]] depicts how [[Sigurd]] learnt the language of birds, in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.
# Sigurd is sitting naked in front of the fire preparing the dragon heart, from [[Fafnir]], for his foster-father [[Regin]], who is [[Fafnir]]'s brother. The heart is not finished yet, and when Sigurd touches it, he burns himself and sticks his finger into his mouth. As he has tasted dragon blood, he starts to understand the birds' song.
# The birds say that Regin will not keep his promise of reconciliation and will try to kill Sigurd, which causes Sigurd to cut off Regin's head.
# Regin is dead beside his own head, his smithing tools with which he reforged Sigurd's sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] are scattered around him, and
# Regin's horse is laden with the dragon's treasure.
# is the previous event when Sigurd killed Fafnir, and
# shows [[Ótr]] from the saga's beginning.

In an [[Poetic Edda|eddic poem]] loosely connected with the Sigurd tradition which is named ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', the reason why a man named Atli once had the ability is not explained. Atli's lord's son Helgi would marry what was presumably Sigurd's aunt, the [[Valkyrie]] [[Sváfa]].

====Greek mythology====
According to [[Apollonius Rhodius]], the [[figurehead]] of [[Jason]]'s ship, the ''[[Argo]]'', was built of [[oak]] from the sacred grove at [[Dodona]] and could speak the language of birds. [[Tiresias]] was also said to have been given the ability to understand the language of the birds by [[Athena]]. The language of birds in [[Greek mythology]] may be attained by magical means. [[Democritus]], [[Anaximander]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], [[Melampus]] and [[Aesopus]] were all said to have understood the birds.

The 'birds' are also mentioned in [[Homer]]'s Odyssey : "“[...] although I am no prophet really, and I do not know much about the meaning of birds. I tell you he will not long be absent from his dear native land, not if chains of iron hold him fast. He will find a way to get back, for he is never at a loss."&lt;ref&gt;The Odyssey - Chapter 1 - What Went On in the House of Odysseus&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Eastern folklore===
In the [[Quran]], Suleiman ([[Solomon]]) and [[David]] are said to have been taught the language of the birds.&lt;ref&gt;27:16 "And Solomon inherited David. He said, "O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty."&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Sufism]], the language of birds is a mystical [[divine language]]. ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'' is a mystical poem of 4647 verses by the 12th century [[Persian literature|Persian]] poet [[Attar of Nishapur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/safa/ho_63.210.67.htm METmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Ginzberg]], ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', 1909&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon]]'s proverbial wisdom was due to his being granted understanding of the language of birds by God.

In Egyptian Arabic, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] is called "the alphabet of the birds".{{cn|date=November 2016}}

===Folklore===
The concept is also known from many [[Folklore|folk tale]]s (including Welsh, Russian, German, Estonian, Greek, Romany),  where usually the protagonist is granted the gift of understanding the language of the birds either by some magical transformation, or as a [[wikt:boon|boon]] by the king of birds. The birds then inform or warn the hero about some danger or hidden treasure. One example is the Russian story [[The Language of the Birds]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Alchemy===
In [[Kabbalah]], [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance]] [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[alchemy]], the language of the birds was considered a secret and perfect language and the key to perfect knowledge, sometimes also called the ''langue verte'', or green language ([[Jean Julien Fulcanelli]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]  ''[[De occulta philosophia libri tres|de occulta philosophia]]'', ([[Emmanuel-Yves Monin]], ''[[Hieroglyphes Français Et Langue Des Oiseaux)]]'', {{cn|date=November 2016}}

===Literature and culture===
Compare also the rather comical and satirical ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' of [[Aristophanes]] and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'' by [[Chaucer]].

In medieval [[France]], the language of the birds (''la langue des oiseaux'') was a secret language of the [[Troubadour]]s, connected with the [[Tarot]], allegedly based on puns and symbolism drawn from homophony, e. g. an inn called  ''au lion d'or'' ("the Golden Lion") is allegedly "code" for ''au lit on dort'' "in the bed one sleeps".&lt;ref&gt;[http://letarot.com/dossiers-chauds/langue-des-oiseaux/ Letarot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Guénon]] has written an article about the symbolism of the language of the birds.&lt;ref&gt;René Guénon - Symbols of Sacred Science, Chapter 9 - The Language of birds&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hiéroglyphes Français Et La Langue Des Oiseaux, Editions du Point d'Eau'' by [[Emmanuel Yves-Monin]] is a systematic study on the subject but is only available in French.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

The artificial language [[zaum]] of [[Russian Futurism]] was described as "language of the birds" by [[Velimir Khlebnikov]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

The children's book author Rafe Martin has written "The Language of Birds" as an adaptation of a Russian folk tale; it was made into a children's opera by composer [[John Kennedy (American musician)|John Kennedy]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In 2003, Salhany co-founded Echo Bridge Entertainment, LLC.

=== Hewlett-Packard ===
Salhany joined the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Board of Directors in January 2002, in connection with the acquisition of [[Compaq|Compaq Computer Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.huffingtonpost.com/paypals/lucille-s-salhany|title=Lucille S.

Salhany was appointed to the Audit Committee in September 2006.

As a result of new leadership and heavy criticism of HP’s board, Salhany left HP’s board in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2012/05/08/how-hewlett-packard-lost-its-way/|title=How Hewlett-Packard lost its way|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léo Apotheker|Leo Apotheker]], took over as chief of HP in November 2010 and brought in five new directors to diversify leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-board/hewlett-packard-shakes-up-board-four-to-leave-idUSTRE70J6YG20110120|title=Hewlett-Packard shakes up board, four to leave|last=Madway|first=Gabriel|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Miracle Mile''' is a neighborhood in the city of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

It contains a stretch of [[Wilshire Boulevard]] known as Museum Row.  It also contains two [[Historic Preservation Overlay Zone]]s: The Miracle Mile HPOZ&lt;ref name="lacity.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preservation.lacity.org/miracle-mile|title=Miracle Mile  - Office of Historic Resources, City of Los Angeles|website=preservation.lacity.org|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Miracle Mile North HPOZ.&lt;ref name="lacity.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preservation.lacity.org/hpoz/la/miracle-mile-north|title=Miracle Mile North - Office of Historic Resources, City of Los Angeles|website=preservation.lacity.org|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Miracle Mile's boundaries are roughly [[3rd Street (Los Angeles)|3rd Street]] on the north, [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] on the east, [[San Vicente Boulevard]] on the south, and [[Fairfax Avenue]] on the west. Major thoroughfares include [[Wilshire Boulevard|Wilshire]] and [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic]] Boulevards, [[La Brea Avenue|La Brea]] and [[Fairfax Avenue|Fairfax]] Avenues, and 6th Street.

===Google Maps===
Google Maps identifies an irregularly shaped area labeled “Miracle Mile” that runs from Ogden Drive on the West to Citrus Avenue &amp; La Brea Avenue on the East. The North is roughly bordered by Fourth Street and Twelfth Street is on the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Miracle+Mile,+Los+Angeles,+CA/@34.0545725,-118.3515401,15.1z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2b91f1603e8b9:0x8a28f71fdb231fe2!8m2!3d34.059534!4d-118.3491169 |title=The Miracle Mile Neighborhood as indicated on Google Maps|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miraclemile1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Miracle Mile in 2004]]

==History==
[[File:Miracle Mile 1960s Postcard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Miracle Mile district during the early 1960s]]
In the early 1920s, Wilshire Boulevard west of [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] was an unpaved farm road, extending through dairy farms and bean fields. Developer A. W. Ross saw potential for the area and developed Wilshire as a commercial district to rival downtown Los Angeles.

The Miracle Mile development was initially anchored by the [[May Company California|May Company Department Store]] with its [[May Company Building (Wilshire, Los Angeles)|landmark 1939 Streamline Moderne building]] on the west and the E. Clem Wilson Building on the east, then Los Angeles's tallest commercial building. The Wilson Building had a dirigible mast on top and was home to a number of businesses and professionals relocating from downtown. The success of the new alternative commercial and shopping district negatively affected downtown real estate values and triggered development of the multiple downtowns which characterize contemporary Los Angeles.

Ross's insight was that the form and scale of his Wilshire strip should attract and serve automobile traffic rather than pedestrian shoppers. He applied this design both to the street itself and to the buildings lining it. Ross gave Wilshire various "firsts," including dedicated left-turn lanes and timed traffic lights, the first in the United States. He also required merchants to provide automobile parking lots, all to aid traffic flow. Major retailers such as Desmond's, Silverwood's, May Co., Coulter's, Mullen &amp; Bluett, Myer Siegel, and Seibu eventually spread down Wilshire Boulevard from Fairfax to La Brea. Ross ordered that all building facades along Wilshire be engineered so as to be best seen through a windshield. This meant larger, bolder, simpler signage and longer buildings in a larger scale.  They also had to be oriented toward the boulevard and architectural ornamentation and massing must be perceptible at 30 MPH (50&amp;nbsp;km/h) instead of at walking speed. These building forms were driven by practical requirements but contributed to the stylistic language of [[Art Deco]] and [[Streamline Moderne]].

[[File:Highsmithmaycompanywilshire.jpg|thumb|The 1939 [[Streamline Moderne]] [[May Company Building (Wilshire, Los Angeles)|May Company Building]] marks the western border of the Miracle Mile and "Museum Row".]]
Ross's moves were unprecedented, a huge commercial success, and proved historically influential. Ross had invented the car-oriented urban form — what [[Reyner Banham]] called "the linear downtown" model later adopted across the United States. The moves also contributed to Los Angeles's reputation as a city dominated by the car. A sculptural bust of Ross stands at 5800 Wilshire, with the inscription, "A. W. Ross, founder and developer of the Miracle Mile. Vision to see, wisdom to know, courage to do."

As wealth and newcomers poured into the fast-growing city, Ross's parcel became one of Los Angeles's most desirable areas. Acclaimed as "America's [[Champs-Élysées]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/citydig-the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-miracle-mile|title=CityDig: The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of Miracle Mile Los Angeles Magazine|date=24 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this stretch of Wilshire near the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] was named "Miracle Mile" for its improbable rise to prominence. Although the preponderance of [[shopping mall]]s and the development in the 1960s of financial and business districts in downtown and [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] lessened the Miracle Mile's importance as a retail and business center, the area has retained its vitality thanks to the addition of several museums and commercial high-rises.

An [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco style]] bank at 5209 Wilshire was built in 1929, and joined a select other Miracle Mile buildings when listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It was designed by the architecture firm of [[Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements]], which also designed the [[Wiltern Theatre]], the [[El Capitan Theatre]], and other notable buildings in Los Angeles.

Note: According to historian David Leighton, of the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' newspaper the Miracle Mile in [[Tucson, Arizona]] derives its name from Los Angeles' Miracle Mile.

The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA), The [[Petersen Automotive Museum]], [[A+D Museum]], [[Craft and Folk Art Museum]], [[George C. Page Museum]], and La Brea Tar Pits pavilions, among others, create "Museum Row" on the Miracle Mile.

The [[Academy Museum of Motion Pictures]] for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (Oscars), designed by [[Renzo Piano]], will be located in the former [[May Company California|May Company]] Department Store on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. A new contemporary structure for the museum's theaters will be located behind the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/academymuseum/|title=Home - Academy Museum of Motion Pictures|first=Academy Museum of Motion|last=Pictures|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Highsmithlacmaoblique.jpg|thumb|The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]

==Historic Preservation Overlay Zones==

==Transportation==
{{update | section | date=August 2017}}
The Miracle Mile District is one of the city's more densely populated areas. To alleviate problems and provide an alternative to automobiles for commuters, [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Los Angeles Metro's]] [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] is being extended along Wilshire Boulevard to the Veterans Affairs Hospital, from its current terminus at Western Avenue in Koreatown.  However, a federal ban on tunneling operations in the area was passed at the behest of the district's [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]]ional representative [[Henry Waxman]] after a [[Salt Lake Oil Field#1985 Ross Dress for Less explosion|1985 explosion]], caused by the buildup of [[methane]] seeping up through the district's long-depleted oil wells, destroyed a department store. The ban was implemented despite the fact that methane deposits abound in most of Los Angeles. In late 2005, the ban was overturned, owing to tunneling techniques that make it possible to mitigate the methane concern. A westerly extension of the subway has recently{{when|date=July 2012}} been supported by many civic officials in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/17/local/me-waxman17|title=In a Reversal, Waxman Backs Westside Subway|last=Groves|first=Martha|date=2005-12-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} the three cities through which the extension may run. In early 2008, the project—which is destined to terminate in Santa Monica—received $5 billion in federal funds. In late 2008, Measure R passed releasing $10 billion in reserve funds to start working on all public transit projects in the city of L.A. as well as the most desired "Subway to the sea" project, which will run from downtown L.A. to Santa Monica. This ambitious project was proposed over ten years ago{{when|date=July 2012}} and will take anywhere from 5 to 10 years to complete. Ongoing construction work on the Fairfax and Wilshire Station is expected by MTA to be completed by 2023&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2017/06/19/decking-at-future-wilshirefairfax-subway-station-finished-5-weekends-early/|title=Decking at future Wilshire/Fairfax subway station finished 5 weekends early|date=2017-06-19|work=The Source|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, a '''nativity scene''' (also known as a '''manger scene''', '''crib''', '''crèche''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|ɛ|ʃ}}or {{IPAc-en|k|r|eɪ|ʃ}}, or in [[Italian language|Italian]] '''presepio''' or '''presepe''') is the special exhibition, particularly during the [[Christmas season]], of art objects representing the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Berliner"&gt;Berliner, R. ''The Origins of the Creche''. Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 30 (1946), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; While the term "nativity scene" may be used of any representation of the very common subject of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]], it has a more specialized sense referring to seasonal displays, either using model figures in a setting or reenactments called "living nativity scenes" (''[[tableau vivant]]'') in which real humans and animals participate. Nativity scenes exhibit figures representing the [[infant Jesus]], his mother, [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], and her husband, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].

Other characters from the nativity story, such as shepherds, sheep, and angels may be displayed near the [[manger]] in a [[barn (building)|barn]] (or cave) intended to accommodate farm animals, as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. A [[donkey]] and an [[ox]] are typically depicted in the scene, and the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] and their camels, described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], are also included. Several cultures add other characters and objects that may or may not be Biblical.

[[Saint Francis of Assisi]] is credited with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. He himself had recently been inspired by his visit to the Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.

Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world, and are displayed during the Christmas season in [[Church (building)|churches]], homes, [[shopping mall]]s, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy, and in the United States their inclusion on public lands or in public buildings has provoked court challenges.

A nativity scene takes its from the accounts of the birth of Jesus in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Raymond E.. ''The Birth of the Messiah''. Doubleday, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermes, Geza. ''The Nativity: History and Legend''. Penguin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Luke's narrative describes an angel announcing the birth of Jesus to shepherds who then visit the humble site where Jesus is found lying in a [[manger]], a trough for cattle feed.({{bibleref2|Luke|2:8-20|9}}) Matthew's narrative tells of "wise men" ({{lang-el|μαγοι|translit=magoi}}) who follow a star to the ''house'' where Jesus dwelt, and indicates that the ''Magi'' found Jesus some time later, less than two years after his birth, rather than on the exact day.({{bibleref2|Matthew|2:1-23|9|Mat.2:1-23}}) Matthew's account does not mention the angels and shepherds, while Luke's narrative is silent on the ''[[Biblical Magi|Magi]]'' and the star. The Magi and the angels are often displayed in a nativity scene with the [[Holy Family]] and the shepherds although there is no scriptural basis for their presence.({{bibleref2|Luke|2:7;2:12;2:17|9}})

==Origins and early history==
[[File:Giotto - Legend of St Francis - -13- - Institution of the Crib at Greccio.jpg|thumb|left|''St. Francis at Greccio'' by [[Giotto]]]]

Saint Francis of [[Assisi]] is credited with creating the first nativity scene&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas, George F.. ''Vitality of the Christian Tradition''. Ayer Co. Publishing, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mylivingnativity.org|title=#MyLivingNativity|website=Upper Room Books|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1223 at [[Greccio]], central Italy,&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Kevin Orlin.

Random House, Inc., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to place the emphasis of Christmas upon the worship of Christ rather than upon [[secular materialism]] and gift giving.&lt;ref name="Mazar"&gt;Mazar, Peter and Evelyn Grala.

''All Around the Year: Holidays and Celebrations in American Life''. University of Illinois Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-252-06516-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Honorius III]] gave his blessing to the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Italy" /&gt;

Such reenactment pantomimes became hugely popular and spread throughout Christendom.&lt;ref name="Santino" /&gt; Within a hundred years every church in Italy was expected to have a nativity scene at Christmastime.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings.&lt;ref name="Santino" /&gt; [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], King of the [[Two Sicilies]], collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged others to do the same.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

The scene's popularity inspired much imitation in Catholic countries, and in the [[Early modern period]] sculpted cribs, often exported from Italy, were set up in Catholic churches and homes. These elaborate scenes reached their artistic apogee in the [[Papal state]], in [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and in [[Genoa]]. By the end of the 19th century nativity scenes became popular beyond Catholic settings, and many versions in various sizes and made of various materials, such as [[terracotta]], paper, wood, wax, and [[ivory]], were marketed, often with a backdrop setting of a stable.

Different traditions of nativity scenes emerged in different countries. Hand-painted ''[[santons]]'' are popular in [[Provence]]. In southern [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] the wood figurines are handcut. Colorful ''[[szopka]]'' are typical in [[Poland]].

A tradition in [[England]] involved baking a [[mince pie]] in the shape of a [[manger]] which would hold the [[Christ child]] until dinnertime, when the pie was eaten. When the [[Puritan]]s banned Christmas celebrations in the 17th century, they also passed specific legislation to outlaw such pies, calling them "Idolaterie in crust".&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in [[Church (building)|churches]], homes, [[shopping mall]]s, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. The Vatican has displayed a scene in [[St. Peter's Square]] near its [[Vatican Christmas Tree|Christmas tree]] since 1982 and the [[Pope]] has for many years blessed the mangers of children assembled in St. Peter's Square for a special ceremony.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In the United States, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City annually displays a Neapolitan Baroque nativity scene before a {{convert|20|ft}} blue spruce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2015/holiday-programming |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221165921/http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2015/holiday-programming |archivedate=2016-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativity scenes have [[Nativity scene#Controversy|not escaped controversy]].

==Components==

===Static nativity scenes===
[[File:Krèsh expo 1.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of several nativity scenes]]

Static nativity scenes may be erected indoors or outdoors during the Christmas season, and are composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph. Other figures in the scene may include [[angel]]s, [[shepherd]]s, and various animals. The figures may be made of any material,&lt;ref name="Dues"&gt;Dues, Greg.''Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide'' Twenty-Third Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and arranged in a stable or grotto. The [[Magi]] may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem.&lt;ref name="Tangerman" /&gt; While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]].&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt;

[[File:BarcelonaNativityScene.jpg|thumb|left|Outdoor nativity scene of life-sized figurines in [[Barcelona]] (2009)]]

The nativity scene may not accurately reflect gospel events. With no basis in the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the [[ox]] and [[asinus|ass]] may be displayed together at the manger. Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as [[Adam and Eve]] and the serpent, [[Noah]] and his animals, the twelve [[sons of Jacob]], the [[Twelve Minor Prophets|twelve prophets]] and the [[twelve apostles]]. Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the [[River Jordan]]{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}, or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted. The art form can be traced back to eighteenth-century [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the [[Child Jesus]], to the [[Holy Family]] and the shepherds, were placed ladies and gentlemen of the nobility, representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]] of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or geese, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesitaly.com/destinations/naples/the-neapolitan-crib "Neapolitan Crib: The crib and 1700’s Naples."] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131220062628/http://citiesitaly.com/destinations/naples/the-neapolitan-crib |date=2013-12-20 }}.

Regional variants on the standard nativity scene are many. The ''putz'' of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] Americans evolved into elaborate decorative [[Christmas village]]s in the twentieth century. In [[Colombia]], the ''pesebre'' may feature a town and its surrounding countryside with shepherds and animals. Mary and Joseph are often depicted as rural [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] people with Mary clad in a countrywoman's shawl and [[fedora hat]], and Joseph garbed in a [[poncho]]. The infant Jesus is depicted as European with Italianate features. Visitors bringing gifts to the Christ child are depicted as Colombian natives.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Ronald J. ''The Ceramics of Ráquira, Colombia: Gender, Work, and Economic Change''. University Press of Florida, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8130-1615-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], large, lighted manger scenes in churches and public buildings grew in popularity, and, by the 1950s, many companies were selling [[lawn ornament]]s of non-fading, long-lasting, weather resistant materials telling the nativity story.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;

===Living nativity scenes===

[[File:Erabascara.jpg|thumb|Living nativity in Bascara]]
{{See also|Nativity play}}
Pantomimes similar to the scene staged by St. Francis at Greccio became an annual event throughout Christendom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mylivingnativity.org|title=#MyLivingNativity|website=Upper Room Books|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Abuses and exaggerations in the presentation of [[mystery play]]s during the Middle Ages, however, forced the church to prohibit performances during the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt; The plays survived outside church walls, and 300 years after the prohibition, German immigrants brought simple forms of the nativity play to America. Some features of the dramas became part of both Catholic and Protestant Christmas services with children often taking the parts of characters in the nativity story. Nativity plays and pageants, culminating in living nativity scenes, eventually entered public schools. Such exhibitions have been challenged on the grounds of separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="Dues" /&gt;

In some countries, the nativity scene took to the streets with human performers costumed as Joseph and Mary traveling from house to house seeking shelter and being told by the houses' occupants to move on. The couple's journey culminated in an outdoor ''[[tableau vivant]]'' at a designated place with the shepherds and the Magi then traveling the streets in parade fashion looking for the Christ child.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt;

Living nativity scenes are not without their problems. In the United States in 2008, for example, vandals destroyed all eight scenes and backdrops at a drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church’s 500 members were involved in the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than [[US$]]2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, Hemant. [http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/13/would-you-help-restore-a-nativity-scene/ "Would You Help Restore a Nativity Scene?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209040828/http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/13/would-you-help-restore-a-nativity-scene/ |date=2009-02-09 }}. ''The Friendly Atheist'', December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In southern Italy, living nativity scenes (''presepe vivente'') are extremely popular. They may be elaborate affairs, featuring not only the classic nativity scene but also a mock rural 19th-century village, complete with artisans in traditional costumes working at their trades. These attract many visitors and have been televised on [[RAI]]. In 2010, the old city of [[Matera]] in [[Basilicata]] hosted the world's largest living nativity scene of the time, which was performed in the historic center, [[Sassi di Matera|Sassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most people in a nativity scene: Welton Baptist Church sets world record|url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/mass/most_people_in_a_nativity_scene_Welton_Baptist_Church_sets_world_record_112612.html|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=worldrecordacademy.com|date=4 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033101/http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/mass/most_people_in_a_nativity_scene_Welton_Baptist_Church_sets_world_record_112612.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals in nativity scenes===

A [[donkey]] (or ass) and an [[ox]] typically appear in nativity scenes. Besides the necessity of animals for a manger, this is an allusion to the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "the ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider"{{bibleref|Isaiah|1:3|KJV}}. The Gospels do not mention an ox and donkey&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster"&gt;Hobgood-Oster, Laura. ''Holy Dogs and Asses: Animals in the Christian Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-252-03213-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source for the tradition may be the extracanonical text, the [[Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew]] of the 7th century. (The translation in this text of {{bibleref|Habakkuk|3:2}} is not taken from the [[Septuagint]].):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=John Gill's Exposition of the Bible | url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/habakkuk-3-2.html | year=1748–63 | authorlink=John Gill (theologian) | last=Gill | first=John | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821011101/http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/habakkuk-3-2.html | archivedate=2010-08-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eucharist in Romanesque France: iconography and theology | last=Saxon | first=Elizabeth | page=107 | publisher=Boydell Press | isbn=978-1-84383-256-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DwQB4_6tG0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Habakkuk+%22Between+two+animals%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_u7kTqPDJuK90QGZ79z5BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Habakkuk%20%22Between%20two%20animals%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And on the third day after the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mary went out of the cave, and, entering a stable, placed the child in a manger, and an ox and an ass adored him. Then was fulfilled that which was said by the prophet Isaiah, "The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Therefore, the animals, the ox and the ass, with him in their midst incessantly adored him. Then was fulfilled that which was said by [[Habakkuk]] the prophet, saying, "Between two animals you are made manifest."&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ox traditionally represents patience, the nation of Israel, and [[Old Testament]] sacrificial worship while the ass represents humility, readiness to serve, and the [[Gentiles]].&lt;ref&gt;Webber, F.R.. ''Church Symbolism''. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-4009-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ox and the ass, as well as other animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition. In a 1415, [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] celebration, the ''Ordo paginarum'' notes that Jesus was lying between an ox and an ass.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Pamela M..

==Selection of distinctive scenes==

===At the Vatican===
In 1982, [[Pope John Paul II]] inaugurated the annual tradition of placing a nativity scene on display in the [[Vatican City]] in the [[Piazza San Pietro]] before the [[Vatican Christmas Tree|Christmas Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Bruce and Alessandra de Rosa. ''Italy for Dummies''. For Dummies, 2007. {{ISBN|0-470-06932-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the nativity scene featured seventeen new figures of [[spruce]] on loan to the Vatican from sculptors and wood sawyers of the town of Tesero, [[Italy]] in the [[Italian Alps]].&lt;ref name="Wooden"&gt;Wooden, Cindy. "No Room at the Inn? Vatican Nativity Scene Gets More Figures".

The Vatican nativity scene for 2007 placed the birth of Jesus in Joseph's house, based upon an interpretation of the Gospel of Matthew. Mary was shown with the newborn infant Jesus in a room in Joseph's house. To the left of the room was Joseph's workshop while to the right was a busy inn—a comment on [[materialism]] versus [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=11318 "Vatican Nativity Scene Trades Manger for St. Joseph’s House"].

"Vatican Nativity Scene Places Christ's Birth in Edifice in Bethlehem". ''Catholic News Service'', December 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene was unveiled on December 24 and remained in place until February 2, 2008 for The [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation of the Lord]].&lt;ref name="Glatz"&gt;Glatz, Carol.

In [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], for example, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]], were depicted among the shepherds and angels worshipping at the manger.

A similar tradition, called "betlehemezés" and involving schoolchildren carrying portable folk-art nativity scenes door-to-door, chanting traditional texts, is part of Hungarian folk culture, and has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years. An example of such a portable wooden nativity scene is on display at the Nativity Museum in Bethlehem.

===In the Czech lands===
The Czech Republic, and the cultures represented in the lands of former Bohemia and Czechoslovakia have a long tradition regarding ''betlémy'', crèches. The tradition of home Nativity scenes is often traced to the 1782 ban of church and institutional crèches by emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], officially responding to public disturbances and the resulting "loss of dignity" of such displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Nutshells to Life‑size Statues|url=http://www.dzm.com/~zuzana/pics/misc-bus/mag/nativity.pdf|publisher=Bridge Publishing House|accessdate=24 November 2013|format=PDF|date=December 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235005/http://www.dzm.com/~zuzana/pics/misc-bus/mag/nativity.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Velinger|first=Jan|title=Czech Nativity scenes|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/czech-nativity-scenes|accessdate=24 November 2013|date=December 7, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060737/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/czech-nativity-scenes|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this followed the [[Edict of Toleration]] proclaimed the previous year, it reduced State support of the Catholic church in this multi-confessional land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nhart.schoolwires.net/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=2657&amp;dataid=697&amp;FileName=Joseph_II_Edict_of_Tolerat.pdf|title=Edict of Toleration (2 January 1782): Emperor Joseph II|publisher=New Hartford Central School District|location=New Hartford, New York|accessdate=30 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003605/http://nhart.schoolwires.net/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=2657&amp;dataid=697&amp;FileName=Joseph_II_Edict_of_Tolerat.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eighteenth Century|url=http://noemewv.nl/Kerkgeschiedenis/Tijdlijn/chrono18.html|publisher=LITURGIE &amp;CETERA|accessdate=24 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232426/http://noemewv.nl/Kerkgeschiedenis/Tijdlijn/chrono18.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of cost arose, and paper-cut crèches, ''papirový betlém'', "the crèche of the poor", became one major expression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Osborne|title=Paper Crèches|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/baker-exhibit.html|accessdate=24 November 2013|year=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231125011/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/baker-exhibit.html|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as wood-carved ones, some of them spectacular as they grew in complexity and detail. Many among the major Czech artists, sculptors and illustrators have as a significant part of their legacy the crèches that they created.

The following people are known for creating Czech paper crèches: 
* [[Mikoláš Aleš]] (1852-1913), famed for his murals of the National Theater.
* Marie Fischerova-Kvechova, illustrator of a large number of children books.
* [[Josef Lada]] (1887-1957), known for his work in Schvejk.
* Josef Wenig (1885-1939), theater decorator and playwright.

====Krýza's crèche====

[[File:KJ hrad.jpg|right|thumb|Krýza's crèche - Castle]]
Tomáš Krýza (1838 - 1918) built in a period of over 60 years a nativity scene covering 60 m² (length 17 m, size and height 2 m) which contains 1389 figures of humans and animals, of which 133 are moveable. It is on display in [[Jindřichův Hradec]], [[Czech Republic]]. Since 1998, it figures as the largest mechanical nativity scene in the world in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.

===In the United States===
[[File:White House Nativity Scene.jpg|thumb|White House nativity scene, 2008]]

Perhaps the best known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche displayed annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 [[choir screen]] from the [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated with a host of 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The [[William Randolph Hearst]] Foundation in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Christmas2009/images.asp Special Exhibitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204010906/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Christmas2009/images.asp |date=2009-12-04 }} Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.

Christmas is celebrated by Australians in a number of ways. Due to its multiculturalism and diversity, the immigrants have influenced the way Christmas is celebrated around the country. In [[Australia]], it’s summer season and is very hot during Christmas time.

During the Christmas time, locals and visitors visit places around their towns and suburbs to view the outdoor and indoor displays. All over the towns, the places are lit with colorful and modern spectacular lighting displays. The displays of nativity scenes with Aussie featured native animals like kangaroos and koalas are also evident.

In Melbourne, a traditional and authentic Nativity Scene is becoming very popular at St. Elizabeth’s Parish, Dandenong North. This annual Australian Nativity Scene creator and artist Wilson Fernandez has been building and creating the traditional nativity scenes since 2004 at St. Elizabeth’s Parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australian Nativity Scene Homepage|url = http://www.australiannativityscene.org/|website = Australian Nativity Scene Homepage|accessdate = 2015-12-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151223030046/http://www.australiannativityscene.org/|archivedate = 2015-12-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NativityScene ChristkindlmarketChicago 12190011a.jpg|thumb|left|A static outdoor nativity scene in the United States, (''Christkindlmarket'', [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]])]]

In 1969, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (representing three [[clergymen]], an [[atheism|atheist]], and a leader of the American Ethical Society), tried to block the construction of a nativity scene on [[The Ellipse]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Menendez"&gt;Menendez, Albert J.. ''Christmas in the White House''. The Westminster Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ACLU claimed the government sponsorship of a distinctly Christian symbol violated separation of church and state,&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; the sponsors of the fifty-year-old Christmas celebration, Pageant of Peace, who had an exclusive permit from the [[Interior Department]] for all events on the Ellipse, responded that the nativity scene was a reminder of America's spiritual heritage.&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals]] ruled on December 12, 1969, that the crèche be allowed that year.&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; The case continued until September 26, 1973, when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; and found the involvement of the Interior Department and the [[National Park Service]] in the Pageant of Peace amounted to government support for religion.&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; The court opined that the nativity scene should be dropped from the pageant or the government end its participation in the event in order to avoid "excessive entanglements" between government and religion.&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt; In 1973, the nativity scene vanished.&lt;ref name="Menendez" /&gt;

[[File:United States Capitol Christmas tree lighting ceremony - December 5, 2007.JPG|thumb|Nativity scenes are permitted on public lands in the United States as long as equal time is given to non-religious symbols.]]

In 1985, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''ACLU v. [[Scarsdale, New York]]'' that nativity scenes on public lands violate separation of church and state statutes unless they comply with "The [[Reindeer]] Rule"—a regulation calling for equal opportunity for non-religious symbols, such as reindeer.&lt;ref name="Comfort"&gt;Comfort, David. ''Just Say Noel: A History of Christmas from the Nativity to the Nineties''. Simon and Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80057-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was further clarified in 1989, when the Supreme Court in ''[[County of Allegheny v. ACLU]]'' ruled that a crèche placed on the grand staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, PA violated the Establishment Clause, because the "principal or primary effect" of the display was to advance religion.

In 1994, at Christmas, the Park Board of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], removed a statue of the infant Jesus from [[Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park]] and replaced it with a statue of the plumed [[Aztec]] god, [[Quetzalcoatl]], commissioned with [[US$]]500,000 of public funds. In response, protestors staged a living nativity scene in the park.&lt;ref name="Comfort" /&gt;

In 2006, a lawsuit by the [[Alliance Defense Fund]], a conservative Christian group in the United States, was brought against the [[Washington (state)|state of Washington]] when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the state [[Washington State Capitol|Capitol]], in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], as long as other symbols of the season were included.&lt;ref name="FFRF"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008458044_noreligion02m.html "Nonbelievers' sign at Capitol counters Nativity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122104247/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008458044_noreligion02m.html |date=2012-01-22 }}.

'''''Nature Morte au Poron (Still Life with Poron)''''' is a 1948 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]]. Picasso painted three versions of the work on 26 December 1948; one is in the collection of the [[National Museum Cardiff|Welsh National Museum of Art]], [[Cardiff]], Wales.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=115}}&lt;ref name='ArtFund'&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature Morte au Poron by Pablo Picasso|url=https://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/10767/nature-morte-au-poron|work=|publisher=[[Art Fund]]|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is an [[Oil painting|oil painting on canvas]] and measures 50.3 × 61&amp;nbsp;cm.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=115}}

Picasso created few oil paintings during 1948, instead concetrating on his ceramics at the Madoura Pottery in [[Vallauris]] on the French [[Cote d'Azur]]. His preferred subjects during this period were [[Françoise Gilot]], his partner, and their son, [[Claude Picasso|Claude]].&lt;ref name='ArtFund'/&gt;

The painting was bought by the National Museum Wales for £1.435 million in 2009 to celebrate the museum's centenary; £100,000 of which came from the [[Art Fund]], with the remainder from the [[Derek Williams (art collector)|Derek Williams Trust]].&lt;ref name='ArtFund'/&gt; It had initially been sold by the Parisian gallery [[Galerie Louise Leiris]] in 1949.&lt;ref name='ArtFund'/&gt; This was the first oil painting by Picasso to enter a Welsh public collection.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=115}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2146">'''Payasos Sin Fronteras''', or '''Clowns without Borders''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] humanitarian organization of [[clown]]s that performs for free for children affected by war. It was founded in [[Barcelona]] in July 1993 and has performed in many war-torn regions such as former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or eastern [[Democratic republic of Congo|DR Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7967869.stm |title = Clowns bring smiles to DR Congo |work=[[BBC]] |date = 27 March 2009|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.clowns.org/ |title = Payasos sin fronteras |date = 27 March 2009 | accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1992, a professional clown from Barcelona received a request from a group of students at the Projecte School in Barcelona to put on shows in refugee camps in the former Yugoslavia. The students offered to accompany the clowns and pay for the costs.
On 26 February 1993, the artists performed in the Veli Joze refugee camp on the Istrian peninsula. The reaction from the children validates the impact and the clowns decided to put on a second show two months later with a group of jugglers. This second trip cemented the idea of setting up an organization. 
In 1992, different artist groups from Spain (clowns, dancers, magicians, etc.) launched 8 trips to the former Yugoslavia and invited other international artists to participate. In 1994 there were 19 trips and in the following years, similar organizations were founded in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, USA, Finland and Australia. In 2012, these eleven organizations created an International Federation to improve communication and coordination among entities.

==History==
[[File:Portraits_Inc_Park_Ave.jpg|thumb|Portraits, Inc.'s [[Park Avenue]] gallery mid 20th century]]
===New York===
Portraits, Inc., was founded in New York City in 1942 by [[Mary Quinn Sullivan#A collection dispersed|Lois Shaw]], an [[Art dealer|art]] and [[antiques dealer]] and socialite. The idea began as a partnership between Mrs. Shaw and the [[USO]] in the early 1940s. At this time Mrs. Shaw hosted weekly studio parties in her [[Park Avenue]] gallery in which she asked guest portrait artist to create drawings from life of the [[United States Armed Forces|military]] men and women in attendance. The portraits of men and women in [[Uniforms of the United States Armed Forces|uniform]] were sent as [[Mat (picture framing)|matted]] works of art to the families of the sitters.
At the time there were not galleries in New York dedicated to the exhibition of fine portraiture. Mrs. Shaw announced a gallery service for living portrait artists called "The Portrait Painters' Clearing House," then, in 1942, founded Portraits, Inc.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |title= Portraits, Inc.: Portrait center of America [ad] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHtOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=%22Lois+Shaw%22+us+government+portrait&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Msa9O3dd8&amp;sig=b7NzAhdw26bqSp4t-FYA7WE2ZKc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1hrTCn_PXAhVKQiYKHTitAEwQ6AEIajAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lois%20Shaw%22%20us%20government%20portrait&amp;f=false |journal=Art News Annual |volume=21–24 |page=173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Shaw was soon joined by [[Helen Appleton Read]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/helen-appleton-read-papers-9184 “Helen Appleton Read papers, [ca. 1920]-1974"] "[[Smithsonian]] Archives of American Art".

== Controversy ==

In 2013, the student organization "Women in Design" at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition on behalf of [[Denise Scott Brown]] to receive joint recognition with her partner, past prize winner [[Robert Venturi]], furthering a debate about sexism in architecture. The petition, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' has "reignited long-simmering tensions in the architectural world over whether women have been consistently denied the standing they deserve in a field whose most prestigious award was not given to a woman until 2004, when [[Zaha Hadid]] won".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work = The New York Times| title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate = April 18, 2013| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130418113111/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| archivedate = April 18, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the petition received international support of several past recipients, the jury said that it cannot revisit the work of past juries, in order to acknowledge the work of Denise Scott Brown and [[Lu Wenyu]], both women and equal partners to their spouses Venturi and [[Wang Shu]], who won in 1991 and 2012 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/pritzker-architecture-prize-committee-refuses-to-honor-denise-scott-brown.aspx | publisher = architectmagazine.com | title = Pritzker Architecture Prize Committee Denies Honors for Denise Scott Brown | accessdate = June 18, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130618105930/http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/pritzker-architecture-prize-committee-refuses-to-honor-denise-scott-brown.aspx | archivedate = June 18, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown told [[CNN]] that "as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career," and that "the Pritzker Prize was based on the fallacy that great architecture was the work of a 'single lone male genius' at the expense of collaborative work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/business/denise-scott-brown-pritzker-prize |title=Denise Scott Brown: Architecture favors 'lone male genius' over women |publisher=CNN |author=Catriona Davies |date=May 29, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619201238/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/business/denise-scott-brown-pritzker-prize |archivedate=June 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Red Planet''''' is a 2000 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by Antony Hoffman, starring [[Val Kilmer]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Tom Sizemore]]. Released on November 10, 2000, it was a critical and commercial failure. The film was Hoffman's only feature film; he primarily directed television commercials.

==Plot==
In 2056 A.D., [[Earth]] is in [[ecological crisis]] as a consequence of [[pollution]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Automated interplanetary missions have been seeding [[Mars]] with atmosphere-producing [[algae]] as the first stage of [[terraforming]] the planet. When the oxygen quantity produced by the algae is inexplicably reduced, the crew of ''Mars-1'' investigate—a crew consisting of Quinn Burchenal ([[Tom Sizemore]]), a geneticist; Bud Chantilas ([[Terence Stamp]]), an aging [[philosopher|philosophical]] scientist and surgeon; systems engineer Robby Gallagher ([[Val Kilmer]]); commander Kate Bowman ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]); pilot Ted Santen ([[Benjamin Bratt]]); and terraforming scientist Chip Pettengill ([[Simon Baker]]).

When ''Mars-1'' is damaged in arrival by a [[Gamma-ray burst]], Bowman remains aboard for repair while the others land to locate an automated habitat (HAB 1) established earlier to manufacture food and [[oxygen]]. During insertion, the team's landing craft is damaged and lands off-course. In the aftermath, "AMEE" (Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion)—a military [[robot]] programmed to guide them—is lost, and Chantilas suffers a ruptured [[spleen]] and internal bleeding, and tells the others to leave him behind. Santen refuses, but Chantilas tells them that they have limited oxygen left to make it to HAB 1. Chantilas tells Gallagher that it is all right, as he got to see Mars for the first time. The crew leaves to allow Chantilas to die in peace. In orbit around Mars, Bowman contacts Houston, which informs her that ''Mars-1'' is in [[decaying orbit]], but offers hope of restoring engine function in departing Mars.

On Mars, the landing party find HAB 1 mysteriously destroyed. They are baffled for an explanation, since the module was designed and field-tested in [[Tornado Alley]] to withstand any damaging storms on Mars. All expect their imminent [[death]]s by [[suffocation]]. Pettengill and Santen wander from the others to explore, later to reach a [[canyon]] where Pettengill accidentally kills Santen, after they get into a fight over whether or not the mission was a failure, and that Pettengill realizes that Santen would never accept defeat. Pettengill returns to Burchenal and Gallagher, and tells them that Santen killed himself. His oxygen depleted, Gallagher opens his helmet, choosing a quick death over asphyxiation – and discovers that Mars' atmosphere is thin but breathable. The only salvageable material from the habitat is all of the liquid fuel, which has ruptured out of its containers but pooled under the wreck. With no remaining power in their suits, the astronauts set it on fire with a flare so they can have a bonfire to survive the massive temperature drop of the Martian night. AMEE reunites with the crew, and the three astronauts notice the robot is damaged and attempt to shut it down so they can recover its guidance device. Perceiving their actions as a threat, AMEE breaks Burchenal's ribs and pursues the others before retreating. Gallagher tells the others she has gone into military mode, and intends to kill them all one by one.  She wounded Burchenal instead of killing him because she has been programmed with knowledge of the old guerrilla tactic that a wounded man will slow the enemy down since effort must be expended to transport a wounded teammate.  

Eventually, Gallagher builds a makeshift radio from parts of the [[Rover (space exploration)|Mars Rover]] ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'', through which Bowman instructs them to use a Russian [[Kosmos (satellite)|probe]]'s sample-return system to launch themselves into orbit. During the trip, Bowman tells Gallagher that the probe can hold only two people.  The trio takes shelter from an ice storm inside of a cave. Devastated by the recent news and afraid of being left behind, Pettengill flees with the radio, only to be killed by AMEE. After the storm subsides Gallagher and Burchenal recover the radio from Pettingill's corpse, and discover that it has become infested by insect-like native Martian life (identified by Burchenal as "[[nematodes]]"). The insects are highly flammable, as using a simple cutting torch on Pettengill's corpse to free his grip caused a chain reaction, making all of the insects in his corpse explode like firecrackers.  Later, the two encounter a field of [[algae]] being eaten by the insects, and Burchenal pieces together what happened.

The Martian insects had lain dormant on their almost dead world, but when the probes from Earth spread algae fields across Mars it gave them a massive new food source and led to a population explosion. The Martian insects are what caused the algae to disappear, but in the process they actually gave Mars breathable oxygen levels, because they produce oxygen as a waste product (explaining why they are so flammable). The insects are also what destroyed the habitat module, as they tore in to get to the food supplies inside.

Burchenal explains to Gallagher that the biochemistry of alien insects' [[Cellular respiration|respiratory metabolism]] is capable of producing oxygen far more efficiently than human science is currently able to. Studying the insects' biochemistry is the key to terraforming Mars, and may even lead to discoveries which will allow Earth's polluted atmosphere to be repaired. However, Burchenal is attacked by swarms of the insects when [[blood]] drips from an open wound. Rather than be eaten alive, he passes his sample vial of insects to Gallagher before [[self-immolation|immolating himself]] and his attackers.

Gallagher reaches the Russian probe, finds sufficient fuel to power the rocket's engine, but not enough electrical power to launch the probe, and realizes that the only available replacement is AMEE's power core. In a final confrontation, Gallagher is able to lure AMEE into a trap and disable her using one of the probe's sample launchers, then takes her battery. Gallagher launches himself in the probe's sample-return capsule and reaches orbit where ''Mars-1'' is waiting for him, and he is recovered and revived by Bowman. Gallagher becomes upset that four astronauts died so that he could live, but Bowman tells him that they did not die for nothing. The computer is busy analyzing the sample of Martian insects which Gallagher brought back, and research on them might lead to repairing Earth itself. With a six-month-long trip back to Earth, the computer has plenty of time to analyze the insects, and Bowman and Gallagher have time to start pursuing a romantic relationship.

==Production==
The production of the film (which was filmed in Wadi Rum in Southern Jordan and in outback Australia) was the subject of numerous reports about the fractious relationship between co-stars [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Val Kilmer]]. Kilmer's reputation for being "difficult" was already well-established, and although the two stars had been friends, they fell out after Kilmer reportedly became enraged when he discovered that production had paid for Sizemore’s exercise machine to be shipped to the set. Kilmer shouted, “I’m making ten million on this; you’re only making two”, to which Sizemore responded by throwing a 50-pound weight at Kilmer (which missed). The two were soon refusing to speak to each other or even come onto the set if the other was present, necessitating the use of body doubles to shoot scenes involving both actors, and their relationship became so bad that one of the producers is said to have asked Sizemore not to hit Kilmer in the face when the big fight finally happened - in the event, Sizemore cooperatively landed a knock-down blow on Kilmer’s chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tom-sizemore-recounts-fame-battle-sobriety-memoir-article-1.1290899|first=Sherryl|last=Connelly|title=Action star Tom Sizemore recounts his rise and fall from fame and his battle with sobriety in new memoir|journal=[[New York Daily News]]|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizemore has since described the film as one of his career regrets, but also stated that he and Kilmer have since reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/26/tom-sizemore-s-revenge-on-tom-cruise-s-scientology-recruitment-drugs-and-craving-a-comeback.html|first=Marlow|last=Stern|title=Tom Sizemore’s Revenge: On Tom Cruise’s Scientology Recruitment, Drugs, and Craving a Comeback|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SMOG''' ({{lang-ru|СМОГ}}) was one of the earliest informal literary groups independent of the [[Soviet state]] in the post-Stalin [[Soviet Union]]. Among the several interpretations of the acronym are ''Smelsot', Mysl', Obraz i Glubina'' (Courage, Thought, Image and Depth), and, humorously, ''Samoe Molodoe Obshchestvo Geniev'' (Society of Youngest Geniuses).&lt;ref&gt;Or: ''Szhatyj Mig Otrazhennoi Giperboly'' (Condensed Moment of Reflected Hyperbole). 'Smog' is also a past tense of the verb 'to be able to', yielding 'I was able to', or 'I did it'. {{Cite book| publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association| isbn = 978-1-907322-52-5| last = Kravchenko| first = E.

It was organized in January/February 1965 by a group of young poets and writers: Poet Leonid Gubanov (initiator, membership card #1), writer and editor Vladimir Batshev (membership card #2), poet and publicist [[Yuri Kublanovsky]], Vladimir Aleynikov, a poet who received the Andrei Belyi prize; and poets Nikolai Bokov, Arkady Pakhomov, later joined by several dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Диссиденты о диссидентстве. «Знамя». — М., 1997, № 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Виктория Андреева , [http://www.port-folio.org/2006/part122.htm SMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Сенкевич А.

I.| title = The Prose of Sasha Sokolov: Reflections on/of the Real| location = London| series = MHRA texts and dissertations| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

The group carried out public reading of poetry and issued several ''[[samizdat]]'' collections and a magazine ''Sfinksy'' ("Sphynxes"). In 1965, they revived the literary meetings at Mayakovsky Square ([[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings]]).&lt;ref name=sundaram-stone&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 16| last = Sundaram| first = Chantal| title = "The stone skin of the monument": Mayakovsky, Dissent and Popular Culture in the Soviet Union|url=http://sites.utoronto.ca/tsq/16/sundaram16.shtml |journal = Toronto Slavic Quarterly| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the members also helped organize the unsanctioned [[Glasnost Meeting|1965 glasnost rally]] calling for a legal trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel.&lt;ref name="daniel-roginsky"&gt;{{Cite book| editor = A.

The group was under the pressure of the state. The last poetry reading took place on April 14, 1966.

[[File:Henry Meynell Rheam - Sleeping Beauty.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sleeping Beauty'', by [[Henry Meynell Rheam]]]]
'''''Sleeping Beauty''''' ({{lang-fr|La Belle au bois dormant}}), or '''''Little Briar Rose''''' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Dornröschen|Dornröschen]]}}), also titled in English as '''''The Sleeping Beauty in the Woods''''', is a classic [[fairy tale]] which involves a beautiful princess, a [[Suspended animation in fiction|sleeping enchantment]], and a handsome prince. The tale was originally published by [[Charles Perrault]]. The version collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was an orally transmitted version of the original literary tale published by Perrault in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]'' in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer, Ruth. (2008). "Before ''Contes du temps passe'' (1697): Charles Perrault's ''Griselidis'', ''Souhaits'' and ''Peau''". ''The Romantic Review'', Volume 99, Number 3. pp. 175–189.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn was based on ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'' by Italian poet [[Giambattista Basile]] (published posthumously in 1634), which was in turn based on one or more [[folklore|folk tales]]. The earliest known version of the story is found in the narrative ''[[Perceforest]]'', composed between 1330 and 1344.

==Perrault's narrative==
Perrault’s narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm's version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', 2002:96, {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part one===
[[Image:Dornröschen.jpg|thumb|Sleeping Beauty is shown a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the old woman. ''Sleeping Beauty'', by [[Alexander Zick]] (1845–1907)]]

At the [[Baptism|christening]] of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good [[Fairy|fairies]] are invited to be [[Godparent|godmothers]] to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old [[Wicked fairy godmother|fairy]] enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son. This is her gift of protection.

The King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess.

A hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.

===Part two===
After wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an ogre lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte ("Count of the Mount").

The Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with  ''[[Sauce Robert]]'' for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a [[red deer|hind]] prepared with ''Sauce Robert'' in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook’s trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been  exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.

==Basile's narrative==
In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleeping beauty is named Talia. By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and "...gathers the first fruits of love." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins — one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.

When he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying "Talia, Sun, and Moon" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the "king" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, "Eat, eat, you are eating of your own." Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what’s going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Giambattista|title=Sun, Moon, and Talia|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#basile|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are earlier elements that contributed to the tale. In the medieval courtly romance ''[[Perceforest]]'' (published in 1528), a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, he draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring he left her that the father was Troylus, who later returns to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 648, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier influences come from the story of the sleeping [[Brynhild]] in the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian [[hagiography]] conventions. It was, in fact, the existence of Brynhild that persuaded the [[Brothers Grimm]] to include the story in later editions of their work rather than eliminate it, as they did to other works they deemed to be purely French, stemming from Perrault's work. Their decision was odd on one point, at least, since in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and Prose Eddas or Volsunga Saga, is their sleeper awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would certainly have known, who wrote an important and encyclopedic volume on [[German mythology]].

The second half, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death, but instead hidden, may have been influenced by [[Genevieve of Brabant]].&lt;ref name="Genevieve of Brabant"&gt;Charles Willing, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Genevieve_of_Brabant.html?id=4Ac6qAAACAAJ "Genevieve of Brabant"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
{{Redirect|Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|the Disney variation of the character|Aurora (Disney)}}
The princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called  "Aurore". The Brothers Grimm named her "Briar Rose" in their 1812 collection.&lt;ref name="Little Briar-Rose"&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html "Little Briar-Rose"]&lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called "Briar Rose" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4 The Annotated Sleeping Beauty]"&lt;/ref&gt; John Stejean named her "Rosebud" in TeleStory Presents.

The [[Brothers Grimm]] included a variant '' Little Briar Rose'' in their collection (1812).&lt;ref name="Little Briar-Rose"/&gt; Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty, unlike the stories of Basile and Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma Mère L'oie on German Folklore", p 961, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name "Rosamond". The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Still, it is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma Mère L'oie on German Folklore", p 962, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, "The Evil Mother-in law". This story begins with the heroine a married mother of two children, as in the second part of Perrault's tale, and her mother-in-law attempting to eat her and the children. Unlike Perrault's version, the heroine suggested an animal be substituted in the dish, and ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law’s attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 376-7 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]] included a variant in ''[[Italian Folktales]]''. The cause of her sleep is an ill-advised [[wish]] by her mother. As in ''[[Pentamerone]]'', the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. He retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, but instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 485 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 744 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''Sun, Moon, and Talia'', Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, ''[[The Young Slave]]''. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one, ''[[The Glass Coffin]]''.&lt;ref name="Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/other.html "Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Jacobs]] noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale ''[[The King of England and his Three Sons]]'', in his ''More English Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html "The King of England and his Three Sons"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 230 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also features ''[[The Twelve Wild Ducks]]'', where she is modified to be the king's stepmother. However, these tales omit the attempted cannibalism.

==Myth themes==
Some folklorists have analyzed ''Sleeping Beauty'' as indicating the replacement of the lunar year (with its thirteen months, symbolically depicted by the thirteen fairies) by the solar year (which has twelve, symbolically the invited fairies). The basic elements of the story can also be interpreted as a nature allegory: the princess represents nature, the wicked fairy godmother is winter, who puts the Court to sleep with pricks of frost until the prince (spring) cuts away the brambles with his sword (a sunbeam) to allow the Sun to awaken sleeping princess (nature).

'''StoryCorps''' is an American [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to record, preserve, and share the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer [[David Isay]]. Its headquarters are located in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

StoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the [[United States]] were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was [[oral history|oral historian]] [[Studs Terkel]], who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in [[Grand Central Terminal]]. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.

==Interviews==
StoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary [[Compact Disc|CD]] of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on [[NPR]]’s ''[[Morning Edition]]''. These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.

==Recording methods==
There are several ways by which participants can record their stories.

===StoryBooth===
Participants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in [[New York City]]’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to [[Lower Manhattan]]’s [[Foley Square]] in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at [[Atlanta]]’s public radio station [[WABE]] in October 2009.

===MobileBooth===
[[File:StoryCorps booth vehicle.jpg|thumb|A StoryCorps MobileBooth parked at the Library of Congress]]
In May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted [[Airstream]] trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.

===Services===
StoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.

=== StoryCorps App ===
With the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.

==Initiatives==
StoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.&lt;ref&gt;StoryCorps Initiatives, http://storycorps.org/initiatives/, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Military Voices Initiative''' records, shares, and preserves the stories of post-9/11 veterans, active-duty service members, and their families. 
* The '''Memory Loss Initiative''' encourages individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of [[memory loss]] to share their stories.
* The '''Historias Initiative''' collects the stories of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] throughout the United States and [[Puerto Rico]].
* The '''[[Griot]] Initiative''' preserves the voices and experiences of [[African Americans]].  These stories will be archived at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].
* The '''September 11 Initiative''' honors and remembers the stories of survivors, rescue workers, and others most personally affected by the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].
* '''OutLoud''' seeks to record and preserve a diverse collection of LGBTQ stories across America.
* The '''Justice Project''' amplifies and preserves the stories of those whose lives have been impacted by mass incarceration and the criminal justice system.

== Community programs ==
StoryCorps currently has four community programs.
* Through the '''MobileBooth Tour''', StoryCorps visits cities and towns across the country to record the stories of the people who live there. The MobileBooth Tour partners with local public radio stations, cultural institutions and community-based organizations to get the word out and invite participants to bring someone to the StoryCorps MobileBooth.
* '''StoryCorps Legacy''' provides opportunities for people with serious illness, and their relatives, to record and share their life stories. StoryCorps Legacy partners with organizations across the country, including hospitals and clinics, pediatric centers, hospice and palliative care departments, and disease specific organizations.
* '''StoryCorpsU (SCU)''' is a year-long, cross-disciplinary (language arts, media, history), youth development program designed for 9th and 10th graders to help students develop self and social awareness, academic skills, and strengthened school relationships. SCU uses StoryCorps’ tested interviewing techniques, combined with outstanding radio broadcasts and animated shorts, to support high school students in the development of identity and in drawing connections between their unique strengths and the college application process. For the 2016-2017 school year, SCU will be implemented in nine schools, more than 30 classrooms, and seven cities. The program was most recently evaluated in 2015 by Dr. Ronald Ferguson, a leading national researcher on racial and economic achievement gaps in education.
* The '''StoryCorps Archive''' is the largest born-digital collection of human voices. The collection is housed and can be accessed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

== Criticism ==
StoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,”&lt;ref&gt;“StoryCorps, An Oral History of America: Sound Booths Will Record Ordinary People’s Life Stories,” National Public Radio, October 23, 2003, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId1⁄41475619, accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the "highly sculpted techniques of the interviews"&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;, such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit "an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory." &lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs.&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 258. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”&lt;ref&gt; Freund, Alexander. “Under Storytelling’s Spell? Oral History in a Neoliberal Age.” Oral History Review, vol. 42, no. 1, Winter/Spring  ///Winter/Spring2015 2015, pp. 13. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1093/ohr/ohv002.&lt;/ref&gt;

StoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on [[Morning Edition]]. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Edition. “A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/2016/12/09/504828481/a-lifelong-secret-can-you-help-this-ailing-94-year-old-man-make-amends. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; The title NPR gave the story - "A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?" - as well as [[Steve Inskeep]]’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires.

[[File:Garudas at Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok (10921613346).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Garuda]]s at [[Wat Phra Kaew]] ([[Bangkok]]) ]]

Traditional '''Thai art''' is primarily composed of [[Buddhist art]] and scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Traditional Thai [[painting]]s usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as [[palace]]s and [[temple]]s. Over time, thai art was influenced by the other Asian styles, most by [[Indian art|Indian]] and [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.

==History==
===Prehistory===
{{see also|Prehistoric Thailand|Ban Chiang}}
Prior to the southwards [[Human migration|migration]] of the [[Tai peoples]] from [[Yunnan]] in the 10th century, [[mainland Southeast Asia]] had been a home to various indigenous communities for thousands of years. The discovery of [[Homo erectus]] fossils such as [[Prehistoric Thailand|Lampang man]] is an example of archaic hominids. The remains were first discovered during excavations in [[Lampang Province]]. The finds have been dated from roughly 1,000,000–500,000 years ago in the [[Pleistocene]]. Stone artefacts dating to 40,000 years ago have been recovered from, e.g., [[Tham Lod rockshelter]] in [[Mae Hong Son]] and Lang Rongrien Rockshelter in Krabi, peninsular Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D. 1990. Lang Rongrien Rockshelter: A Pleistocene–early Holocene Archaeological Site from Krabi, Southwestern Thailand. Philadelphia: The University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological data between 18,000–3,000 years ago primarily derive from cave and rock shelter sites, and are associated with [[Hoabinhian]] foragers.&lt;ref&gt;Lekenvall, Henrik. "Late Stone Age Communities in the Thai-Malay Peninsula". ''Journal of Indo-Pacific Archaeology'' 32 (2012): 78-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sukhothai period===
The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval [[face]]s. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in [[metal]] rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]]
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head
*[[Arm]]s round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees
*[[Hand]]s like lotuses about to bloom
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals
*[[human head|head]] like an egg
*[[Hair]] like scorpion stingers
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Ayutthaya period===
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
The surviving art from this period was primarily executed in stone, characterised by juxtaposed rows of Buddha figures. In the middle period, Sukhothai influence dominated, with large [[bronze]] or [[brick]] and [[stucco]] Buddha images, as well as decorations of [[gold leaf]] in free-form designs on a [[lacquer]]ed background. The late period was more elaborate, with Buddha images in royal attire, set on decorative bases.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Bangkok period===
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
This period is characterized by the further development of the Ayutthaya style, rather than by more great innovation. One important element was the ''Krom Chang Sip Mu'' (Organization of the Ten Crafts), founded in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], which was responsible for improving the skills of the country's craftsmen.  Paintings from the mid-19th century show the influence of Western art.

===Contemporary===
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}

Modern painting in the western sense started late in Thailand, with Professor  [[Silpa Bhirasri]] and the establishment of [[Silpakorn University]], but Thai artists are now expressing themselves in a variety of media such as [[installation art|installations]], [[photographs]], [[printmaking|prints]], [[video art]] and [[performance art]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Painting==
[[File:RoyalWhiteElephant.jpg|A depiction of a [[white elephant]] in 19th century Thai art.|thumb|250px]]
Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of [[Western world|Western]] influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist [[Khrua In Khong]] is well-known as the first artist to introduce [[linear perspective]] to Thai traditional art.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, themes derived from the Thai versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, not to mention scenes of daily life. Some of the scenes are influenced by [[Thai folklore]] instead of following strict Buddhist [[iconography]].

== Sculpture ==
{{see also|Buddhist art#Southern Buddhist art|Buddha images in Thailand}}

Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Most of the sculptures depict Buddha. An exception is the ''[[dvarapala]]''.

==Architecture==
{{main|Architecture of Thailand}}
[[File:BOB 3205-3.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Phra Maha Chedi Si Ratchakan, [[Wat Pho]], Bangkok.]]

Architecture is the preeminent medium of the country's cultural legacy and reflects both the challenges of living in Thailand's sometimes extreme climate as well as, historically, the importance of architecture to the Thai people's sense of community and religious beliefs. Influenced by the architectural traditions of many of Thailand's neighbors, it has also developed significant regional variation within its vernacular and religious buildings.

===Thai temples===
{{Main|Thai temple art and architecture}}
[[Buddhist temples in Thailand]] are known as "[[wat]]s", from the [[Pali|Pāḷi]] ''vāṭa'', meaning an enclosure. A temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world. Wat [[architecture]] has seen many changes in Thailand in the course of history. Although there are many differences in layout and style, they all adhere to the same principles.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Traditional Thai houses===
{{Main|Traditional Thai house}}
As the phrase "Thai stilt house" suggests, one universal aspect of Thailand's traditional architecture is the elevation of its buildings on stilts, most commonly to around head height. The area beneath the house is used for storage, crafts, lounging in the daytime, and sometimes for livestock. The houses were raised due to heavy flooding during certain parts of the year, and in more ancient times, predators. Thai building and living habits are often based on superstitious and religious beliefs. Many other considerations such as locally available materials, climate, and agriculture have a lot to do with the style.

==Ceramics==
{{main|Thai ceramics}}
Ceramics in Thailand were mostly used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. Thai ceramics in the pattern of nature and animals were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.

== Shadow play ==
{{main|Nang Talung|Nang yai}}
Shadow theatre in [[Thailand]] is called ''[[nang yai]]''; in the south there is a tradition called ''[[Nang Talung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lian Lim |first1=Siew |title=The Role of Shadow Puppetry in the Development of  Phatthalung Province, Thailand |url=http://www.siewlianlim.com/uploads/7/1/1/3/7113499/the_role_of_shadow_puppetry_in_the_development_of__phatthalung.pdf |website=siewlianlim.com |publisher=Southeast Asia Club Conference, Northern Illinois University |accessdate=27 August 2018 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nang yai puppets are normally made of [[cowhide]] and [[rattan]]. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of [[song]]s and [[chant]]s. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre. Nang drama has influenced modern [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai cinema]], including filmmakers like [[Cherd Songsri]] and [[Payut Ngaokrachang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahidol.ac.th/thailand/shadow.html Nang Yai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021225005656/http://www.mahidol.ac.th/thailand/shadow.html |date=2002-12-25 }} from [[Mahidol University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of Literature''''' is a book on [[literature|literary scholarship]] by [[René Wellek]], of the [[Structural linguistics|structuralist]] [[Prague school]], and [[Austin Warren]], a self-described "old [[New Criticism|New Critic]]".{{sfn|Drake|1996|pp=851–854}} The two met at the [[University of Iowa]] in the late 1930s, and by 1940 had begun writing the book; they wrote collaboratively, in a single [[Writer's voice|voice]] over a period of three years. Its contents were based on their shared understandings of literature.

Originally consisting of twenty chapters&amp;nbsp;– one was cut in later editions&amp;nbsp;– ''Theory of Literature'' describes various aspects of [[literary theory]], [[Literary criticism|criticism]], and [[literary history|history]]. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as [[rhythm]] and [[Metre (poetry)|meter]]. They stress the need to focus on the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] used by [[Roman Ingarden]].

Published by [[Harcourt, Brace, and Company]] in December 1948, ''Theory of Literature'' received mixed reviews from the academic community. It was used to teach literary theory beginning soon after publication and remained in common use into the 1960s. Its success has been credited as introducing European literary scholarship into the US and crystallizing a movement towards intrinsic literary criticism. ''Theory of Literature'' saw three editions and has been translated into more than twenty languages.

==Background==
[[René Wellek]] (1903–1995{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=163}}) was an Austrian-born scholar from the [[Structural linguistics|structuralist]] [[Prague school]] of [[linguistics]],{{sfn|Makaryk|1993|p=484}} studying under [[Vilém Mathesius]].{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=169}} Wellek had training in [[Classics|classical literature]] and was fluent in several European languages, both [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].{{sfn|Holquist|2010|pp=166, 168}} His theoretical training included the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]], as used in [[Roman Ingarden]]'s work, and the psychologically influenced linguistics of [[Karl Bühler]].{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=170}} After [[Nazi Germany]] occupied [[Prague]] in 1939, Wellek fled London&amp;nbsp;– where he had been teaching&amp;nbsp;– for the United States, teaching at the [[University of Iowa]] under Norman Foerster.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=68}}

There Wellek met [[Austin Warren]] (1899–1986{{sfn|NYT 1986, Austin Warren}}), an American literary scholar who considered himself an "old [[New Criticism|New Critic]]".{{sfn|Drake|1996|pp=851–854}} He had written extensively on [[literary criticism]]{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=69}} and was raised in, but later saw several limitations to, the [[New Humanism|New Humanist]]&lt;!-- not Sarkar's neo-humanism --&gt; views promoted by [[Irving Babbitt]] and [[Paul Elmer More]]. Wellek and Warren were soon in agreement over several aspects of literature, and by 1940 they had begun considering collaboration on a book.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=71}} Over the next several years they furthered their understandings of European and American literature theory through discussions with [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]], and extensive reading of contemporary European writings.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=72}}

==Writing==
Owing to several academic commitments, work on ''Theory of Literature'' did not begin until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] over a period of two summers. Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with more work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred to [[Yale University]] (1946) and Warren to the [[University of Michigan]] (1948), but collaboration continued.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|pp=73–74}}

The title, according to Wellek and Warren, was "more than ordinarily difficult" to choose. Some titles, such as ''Theory of Literature and Methodology of Literary Study'', were dismissed as too cumbersome.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=v}} However, in a 1950 review for ''[[The Antioch Review]]'', the literary scholar Herbert S. Benjamin wrote that a better title would have been ''Theory of the Methodology of the Literary Study''; he considered the book lacking the theory implied by the chosen title.{{sfn|Benjamin|1953|p=427}}{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=400}}

The original publication of ''Theory of Literature'' consists of twenty chapters set in five sections based on thematic similarities;{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} one chapter and section was removed in later editions.{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=408}} Wellek contributed thirteen of the book's chapters, while Warren wrote six; the final chapter was written collaboratively.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=vi}} Although most of the chapters are credited as the work of one man, the two often copyedited and proofread each other's work, at times inserting entire sentences or paragraphs. Each also suggested further references that the other could use in expanding his chapter.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|pp=73–74}}

In their writing Wellek and Warren attempted to present a single [[Writer's voice|voice]] despite the dominance of individuals.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=vi}} Their success in presenting such a voice has been debated. Wellek later recalled that people often told him it was difficult to tell who had written which chapter without consulting the book's introduction.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=73}} However, the literary scholar C. J. van Rees of [[Tilburg University]] notes that Wellek's influences are prevalent in chapters authored by Warren.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=504}} Aldo Scaglione, in a review of the second edition, wrote that "one immediately senses the change of hand" between chapters by different authors.{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=400}}

==Contents==

===Section 1: Definitions and Distinctions.===
The first section, entitled Definitions and Distinctions, consists of five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition with those of others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only ''[[belles-lettres]]'' (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal"){{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=8–10}} and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=3}} Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach would be able to properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=5–8}}

[[File:Quinto Orazio Flacco.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A painting of a man in a toga, looking forward and smiling; he is holding a writing utensil.|Wellek and Warren begin their discussion of the function of literature with [[Horace]]'s proclamation that works should be "sweet and useful" (''dulce et utile'').]]
Wellek and Warren limit their definition of literature to pieces of "imaginative literature", which can gain artistic merit from their coherence and complexity. The language in literary works is contrasted from scientific and other language by the use of [[Connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] (non-literal) language and expressive content.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=11–14}}{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=528}} Studies of literature must be literary and systematic,{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=506}} treating literature as literature and not part of another field.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=507}} Wellek and Warren discuss several proposed functions of literature, beginning with [[Horace]]'s proclamation that literature must be "sweet and useful" (''dulce et utile''; have a coalescing aesthetic and functional role), and extending to literature as a substitute for travel and experience, a vehicle for truth or persuasion, to relieve or incite emotion, or as something without a function.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=20–27}} They ultimately describe the main function of literature as being loyal to its own nature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=28}}

They call for a systematic and integrated study of literature, uniting [[literary theory]], which outlines the basic principles of literature; criticism, which critiques individual works; and [[literary history|history]], which outlines the development of literature. Although these aspects have clear distinctions, they are in a [[dialectic]]al relationship and should not be separated; for example, a theory of literature is impossible without referring to works of literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=29–31}} They reject [[Historicism|Historicist]] approaches to literary history, which they find reduce literary history to "a series of discrete and hence finally incomprehensible fragments" and emphasize the author's intent too greatly.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=33–35}} Instead, Wellek and Warren argue that a work must be seen from the point of view of both its own period and all subsequent periods, as a work's historical meaning is derived from "the history of its criticism by its many readers in many ages."{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=33–35}} Criticism should not be limited to classical and medieval literature, but also include works by living authors.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=36}}

Wellek and Warren describe the term [[comparative literature]] as "troublesome", noting that it has been used for the study of [[oral literature]], the study of the literatures in two or more countries, and the study of a "general", "universal", or "world" literature; this last use, according to the authors, obviates issues present in the other understandings of the term.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=38–41}} This understanding of literature as a totality can be used to trace the development of the art, unlimited by differences between languages.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=41}} Within this comparative literature other supernational literatures, which may be based on [[language families]] and schools, are also apparent. There are also [[national literature]]s which, although possibly of the same language, will still have thematic differentiations. These are also worthy of study.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=41–43}}

[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A balding man with a beard and mustache|In describing the treatment of manuscripts, Wellek and Warren often cite research into the works of [[William Shakespeare]].{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=54–58}}]]

===Section 2: Preliminary Operations===
This section consists of a single chapter regarding the treatment, classification, annotation, and other aspects of working with [[manuscript]]s and related documentation.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} Wellek and Warren describe tasks such as authenticating manuscripts and establishing an author and date as important ones without which "critical analysis and historical understanding would be hopelessly handicapped"; however, these tasks should be preliminary to the "ultimate task of scholarship", analysis, and not a goal in themselves.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=49}} Wellek and Warren note the importance of identifying [[Literary forgery|forgeries]], a task which can be completed in numerous ways: [[paleography]], [[bibliography]], linguistics, and history may all be involved. These forgeries may spark further investigation and literary debates which can result in a better understanding of the period, the writer, or the writer's oevre.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=60–62}}

The authors identify two levels of operations when dealing with manuscripts: the assembly and preparation of the materials, and the establishment of aspects such as chronology and authorship.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=49}} At the first level one must locate and identify materials to study, be they written, printed, or oral; such a task may be difficult and depend on factors outside literature in its completion.&lt;!--They include finding a skilled story-teller, understanding certain documentation systems, having sufficient funds, networking, and prestige to obtain documents...--&gt; Written and printed works must then be edited for readability; this task, which requires "lucky guesswork", entails deciphering illegible parts in the material, classifying it, and identifying possible changes made by scribes (and thus bringing the material closer to its "author's own").{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=50–52}} Meanwhile, the second level may require greater initiative from the one studying a work; it involves, among other things, selection of what should be published, how it is best arranged in a collection, the establishment of chronology and authorship through internal and external evidence, and the provision of proper [[annotation]] and commentary.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=54–58}}

[[File:Sadness, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|alt=A young woman, looking to her right and leaning|upright|In discussing how literature does not necessarily reflect an author's experiences, Wellek and Warren quote the actress [[Ellen Terry]]: if Shakespeare wrote only what he knew, he "must have been a woman".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=73}}]]

===Section 3: The Extrinsic Approach to the Study of Literature===
The third section consists of five chapters discussing various elements [[extrinsic]] to works of literature, such as biography, psychology, social milieu, ideas, and other arts; this is opposed to elements [[intrinsic]] to a work, which are explored in Section&amp;nbsp;4.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} They write that research into extrinsic elements often results in an attempt to establish some [[causality]] between the extrinsic elements and a work. Although "[n]obody can deny that much light has been thrown on literature by a proper knowledge of the conditions under which it has been produced", such studies "can never dispose of problems of description, analysis, and evaluation of an object such as a work of literary art."{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=65}}

Wellek and Warren describe three views of a biographical approach, of which only one&amp;nbsp;– the biographical aspects relating to the production of a work&amp;nbsp;– can be of use;{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=67–68}} this use, however, is limited. They reject the views that works accurately reflect the author's life or that the author's life must be understood in order to understand a particular work.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=69}} According to Wellek and Warren, works may indeed reflect the author's experiences, but they may also reflect an author's hopes and dreams, or literary tradition and convention, and as such are "not a document for biography".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=70–72}} Likewise, an understanding of personal style (what makes a work "[[John Milton|Miltonic]]", "[[Keats]]ian", "[[Shakespeare]]an", or "[[Virgil]]ian") does not rely on knowledge of the author's life. They conclude that "it seems dangerous to ascribe to [biography] any real critical importance", and that such approaches, if undertaken at all, should be done with a "sense" of the distinctions outlined above.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=73–74}}

Wellek and Warren consider analysis of characters the only legitimate application of psychological analysis in literary study. Such an analysis, however, they find lacking on its own merits: individual characters do not fit psychological theories of the time they are written. Works which are true to certain psychological theories, meanwhile, are not necessarily better. Thus, they question the value of looking for psychological "truth" in how a work is presented.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=86–88}}  Additionally they outline and critique psychological theories that have been used to analyze authors{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=75–79}} and the creative process.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=81–85}}

[[File:SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A man in formal dress, looking forward|upright|Wellek and Warren note that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s work helped bring [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonistic]] views to England.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=111}}]]
Wellek and Warren write that literature is ultimately a social institution as several aspects of it are created or influenced through [[social convention]]s and [[Norm (social)|norms]]. They reject a more specific understanding of social realities in literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=89–90}} An author, for example, is a [[social being]], raised and shaped by society and is in a dialectic relationship with the audience: the audience provides recognition and an income, and the author shapes audiences' tastes and behavior.&lt;!--This relationship can be described [[Empirical method|empirically]].--&gt;{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=91–98}} Intrinsic elements of the work,&lt;!--such as [[stock character]]s and situations--&gt; and indeed the "realization of certain aesthetic values", can reflect contemporary society and its attitudes.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=100–104}} Literature does not, however, "correctly" reflect society or life,{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=89–90}} and may exhibit little connection.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=100–104}} As such, "social truth" should not become an artistic value of its own right, and literature should not be thought of as a "substitute for sociology or politics".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=106}}

Wellek and Warren note arguments that literature is a form of [[philosophy]] or, alternatively, that it is devoid of such ideas.  They reject extreme versions of these arguments. They write that "a knowledge of the history of philosophy and of general ideas" will be valuable for a researcher.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=107–109}} However, they note that philosophical ideas may not have been consciously included in a work. Instead, they agree with the German scholar Rudolf Unger that "literature expresses a general attitude toward life, that poets usually answer, unsystematically, questions which are also themes of philosophy", in a manner that differs over time.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=111–112}} They outline attempts at classifying these ideas, including through ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' ("world view") and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'' ("time spirit"), before showing shortcomings in these systems.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=113–118}} They then write that students of literature, an art which may (but need not) parallel philosophical development, should focus on how ideas enter the work.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=120–121}} Wellek and Warren argue that a work does not necessarily become better with more philosophical content.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=122–123}}

Wellek and Warren write that the relationship between literature and other forms of art, such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], or [[visual art]], is "highly various and complex". For example, literature may inspire the other art forms, or vice versa.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=124–126}} A work of literature may also attempt to have the same effect as another art, through visualization, musicality, or other techniques. However, literature remains a separate art form, and effects found within are conveyed imperfectly. The emotions triggered by a work, or the intentions or theories behind it, will likewise not completely parallel those of another art form;{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=124–127}} individual forms of art have also "evolved" differently.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=135}}&lt;!--Although social backgrounds may be compared, "genuine parallelisms" are few.--&gt; Instead, Wellek and Warren suggest that works of art, like literature, can only be truly understood by looking at the works of art themselves and not their extrinsic aspects.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=129–131}} A comparison between literature and another art form, thus, is secondary to establishing "outlines of strictly literary evolution".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=135}}

===Section 4: The Intrinsic Study of Literature===
This section, almost twice the size of the others, consists of eight chapters regarding various elements [[intrinsic]] to works of literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} Wellek and Warren write that starting an analysis from elements intrinsic to the work is "natural and sensible", given that "only the works themselves justify all our interest" in extrinsic issues.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=139}} They outline different definitions of literature, including as artifacts, sequences of sounds pronounced when reading, the experiences of the reader or author, or the "sum of all past and possible experiences" (alternatively "the experience common to all the experiences") related to a work. All these understandings they find lacking.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=141–150}} Instead they suggest that literature is a "potential cause of experiences" consisting of a system of stratified norms&amp;nbsp;– implicit in the work&amp;nbsp;– which can only be partially realized by the reader;{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=151–152}} it is neither purely [[materialism|material]], [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mental]], nor [[idealism|ideal]], nor is it static or bereft of value.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=157}}

[[File:Alexander Pope by Michael Dahl.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=A man holding a pen and looking to his left|Among the works Wellek and Warren quote when discussing [[Metre (poetry)|meter]] is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Man]]''.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=159–176}}]]
Wellek and Warren consider patterns of sound as inherent to the text; these must be analyzed while keeping the meaning (or general emotional tone) in mind. They suggest two different aspects of sound systems: sounds in isolation, and sounds in relations with others. The sounds in isolation are used in a work establish a [[euphony]] or orchestration&amp;nbsp;– a sound aesthetic which may be pleasing or harsh&amp;nbsp;– while the relational aspect "may become the basis of [[rhythm]] and meter".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=159–160}} Regarding euphony, Wellek and Warren discuss issues of classification, [[rhyme]], [[onomotopeia]], and the "[[wikt:physiognomy|physiognomy]]" of sounds as part of orchestration.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=161–164}} Of rhythm they explore varying definitions, applications, typology, and artistic value.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=165–167}} They then discuss theories of meter and their shortcomings, noting that the metric foundation differs between languages and stressing that meaning should not be divorced from meter.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=168–176}}

Language, meanwhile, they describe as "quite literally the material of the literary artist"; although a work is influenced by language, the writer's style, the use of communicative language, may influence language.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=177–178}} Rather than use a work to study [[linguistic history]], they recommend examining works through [[Stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], which in literature they define as "the study of a work of art or a group of works which are to be described in terms of their aesthetic function and meaning".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=180–183}} Such studies can be done either as a search for a "total meaning" or a "sum of individual traits".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=184}} Ideally, such a study should "establish some unifying principle, some general aesthetic" in a work or [[genre]], although some may be more difficult than others.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=185–189}} As such, they reject stylistic studies which focus mainly on "peculiarities of style"&lt;!--, which lead to too much emphasis on what makes a writer unique--&gt; or which are linked to extrinsic elements&lt;!--, which make fails to consider the poorly defined relationship "between psyche and word"--&gt;.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=185–189}}

For other understandings of meaning, Wellek and Warren suggest a look at the sequence of [[imagery|image]], [[metaphor]], symbol, and [[myth]], which they consider making up the "central poetic structure" of a work.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=190}} In turns, they outline various historical definitions of the terms&amp;nbsp;– which at times overlap&amp;nbsp;– before writing that most of these theories have treated the sequence as "detachable parts of the works in which they appear."{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=191–198}} This Wellek and Warren refuse, instead arguing that "the meaning and function of literature [i]s centrally present in metaphor and myth".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=191–198}} They show that the dominant form of [[figurative language]] shifts over time{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=199–204}} before overviewing two diverging typologies of metaphor, that of Henry W.&amp;nbsp;Wells and Hermann Pongs.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=205–213}} They finally discuss several aspects of "practical criticism" based on poetic language and its underlying assumptions. They reject approaches which attempt to understand the author through his or her words or which attempt to understand figurative language alone; instead, it should be studied not in isolation but as "an element in the totality, the integrity, of the literary work".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=214–218}}

After reiterating their views of the relationship between reality and literature, Wellek and Warren write that narrative fiction takes place in its own "worlds", consisting of five codeterminant elements: [[narrative structure]], [[Character (arts)|characters]], [[Setting (narrative)|setting]], world-view, and [[Tone (literature)|tone]]. The latter two are discussed in the following chapter.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=219–222}} They define the narrative structure as built around a pattern of dialog and description, and various concepts related to narrative; these include time within a work, [[Narrative mode#Narrative point of view|narrative points of view]] and [[Narrative mode#Narrative voice|voices]], major types, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[narrative device|devices]], and pacing.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=223–227}} This is followed by a discussion of [[characterization]], involving modes, types, and typologies, then setting (the environment in a work).{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=228–229}} This world can serve as a basis for analysis and judgment of a work.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=219–222}} Although they focus on the "world" in narrative fiction, [[drama]] shares similar aspects.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=234}}

[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man sitting and inscribing|Wellek and Warren proscribe a more specific understanding of [[genre]] than [[Aristotle]]'s [[poetry]], [[prose]], and [[drama]].]]
Wellek and Warren consider genres as influencing "any critical and evaluative&amp;nbsp;... study".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=235}} All works of literature can be so classified, although the genres themselves are (presumably) not fixed. After outlining a brief history of the "ultimate" genres as understood by [[Aristotle]] ([[poetry]], [[prose]], and drama), they show such an understanding as "scarcely promising of objective results" and overly prescriptive; they also reject several alternative theories of genre.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=236–239, 245}} Instead, they suggest that genres should be understood descriptively, as based on the "outer form" (meter, structure) and the "inner form" (attitude, tone, purpose), with the "outer form" emphasized.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=241–242}} Wellek and Warren consider genres to be continually shifting, with good writers conforming to but ultimately expanding them.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=244}}

According to Wellek and Warren, evaluation of literary work should be done based on the work's own nature, divorced from an author's practical or scientific intent. They reject evaluation based on extra-literary content, writing instead that literature&amp;nbsp;– like all fine art&amp;nbsp;– will provide an "aesthetic experience" which can be judged.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=249–252}} They note various criteria used to identify "good" literature, rejecting [[Russian formalism]]'s criterion of [[defamiliarization]] and similar understandings for one based on the diversity of materials amalgamated within a work.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=253–255}} They reject a static hierarchy or [[generationism|generationalist]] understanding of literary greats. Instead, they suggest that every work's rank changes when a new work is introduced and that values within are "really, or potentially, present in the art object".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=257–258}} They note a dialectic relationship between evaluating and critically analyzing literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=262}} This ties genre theory to the history of literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=263–266}}

Wellek and Warren&amp;nbsp;– disapproving of contemporary histories of literature&amp;nbsp;– opine that a history of literature is possible and should be based on elements intrinsic to works. Such a history should describe the development of "[t]he process of interpretation, criticism, and appreciation" or trace the development of works in small and large groups before tying it to universal literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=263–266}} This "historical evolution" of related yet individual events they tie to "variable schemes of values" which must be "abstracted from history itself."{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=267–268}} They suggest numerous ways in which this can be accomplished, including identifying the development of values, traits, forms, themes, and motifs.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=269–273}} Periodization, they write, should not be based on chronological boundaries, but a "time section dominated by a system of literary norms, standards, and conventions, whose introduction, spread, diversification, integration, and disappearance can be traced" which must be extracted from history, with boundaries marked by both internal and external changes.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=274–280}} They close the chapter by stating that existing methods are "clumsy" and that a new ideal and methods of literary history is necessary.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=282}}

===Section 5: The Academic Situation===
The final section of the book, removed in later editions, consists of a single chapter regarding the study of literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=ix–x}} Wellek and Warren bemoan that literary students are "offered no wider choice than between the '[[historical method]]'&amp;nbsp;... and dilettantism", supporting instead a critically oriented literary scholarship.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=285–288}} After finding faults with the literary scholarship in England, Germany, France, and Russia, Wellek and Warren suggest that the US is poised to start a new era in scholarship.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=285–288}} They note that this opportunity may, however, be lost in a conflict between those advocating change and the inertia (including persons defending the [[status quo]]) in American literary studies and institutions.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=289–293}}

Rather than maintain the system of having scholars specialized in certain time periods and authors, Wellek and Warren push for scholars who have mastered certain approaches and thought patterns, preferably those who are from a literary background. They also recommend "sharper distinction between the teacher and the scholar", allowing some individuals to devote their careers to research and not teaching.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=289–293}} They emphasize a need for fluency in several [[modern language]]s rather than an understanding of the [[Classical language|classical ones]];{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=289–293}} this coincides with their urge to establish departments teaching comparative literature.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|pp=297}} They recommend the teaching of literary methods and theories in combination with periods and authors, with a retooling of the [[doctoral dissertation]] procedures.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=294}}

==Theoretical borrowings==
''Theory of Literature'' was influenced by [[Russian formalism]], a school of thought which sought to examine literature (or, more precisely, what formalist-turned-structuralist [[Roman Jakobson]] termed ''[[literariness]]''{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=172}}) as an autonomous body,{{sfn|Makaryk|1993|p=53}} and the American New Criticism, which likewise denied external influences.{{sfn|Makaryk|1993|p=120}} The book borrowed formalism's concepts of an aesthetic function and dominance of different elements of language.{{sfn|Parrinder|1993|pp=135–136}} Unlike Russian formalism, however, Wellek and Warren's theory recognized the possibility of factors outside the work being studied, although Wellek and Warren continued to emphasize aspects within the work itself.{{sfn|Parrinder|1993|pp=135–136}} Also unlike their forerunners, Wellek and Warren saw aesthetic value as not the [[defamiliarization]] of the mundane, but an interaction among the strata derived from Roman Ingarden's work: the [[phonology|phonological]] (sound) level at the base, then [[semantic]] (meaning), and the "world" created by literature. This last strata they divided into [[paradigm]]s and "metaphysical qualities", the level which a reader contemplates.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=516}}{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=529}} They did not, however, accept Ingarden's teachings as a whole, writing that Ingarden "analyze[d] the work of art without reference to values", a system which they found untenable.{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=175}}

Wellek and Warren's concept of aesthetics borrowed from the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], implying that a specific "aesthetic realm" was autonomous within the work and required a certain perspective to properly understand;{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=512}} they emphasize this with a quote from the [[neo-Kantian]] philosopher and literary critic [[Eliseo Vivas]], that beauty is a "character of some things&amp;nbsp;... present only in the thing for those endowed with the capacity and the training through which alone it can be perceived".{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=524}} Meanwhile, their depiction of a dynamic scale of values, as opposed to an anarchical one, is a reimagining of [[perspectivism]], which Wellek and Warren define as "recogniz[ing] that there is one poetry, one literature, comparable in all
ages, developing, changing, full of possibilities".{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=35}}{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=519}} They explicitly denounce [[Universality (philosophy)|absolutism]] and [[relativism]].{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=519}}

==Publication==
''Theory of Literature'' was published by [[Harcourt, Brace, and Company]] in December 1948, with a [[copyright notice]] dated 1942, 1947, and 1949.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=75}}{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=iv}} Wellek notes that 1942, often quoted as a year of publication in Europe, is in fact when his article "The Mode of Existence of a Literary Work of Art" was published in ''[[The Southern Review]]''; the article was reused as a chapter of ''Theory of Literature'', leading to the inclusion of the year 1942.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=75}} Several other works by Wellek and Warren had been adapted for ''Theory of Literature''.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=504}}

Translations of ''Theory of Literature'' began soon after it was published;{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=400}} by 2010 the work had been translated into more than twenty languages,{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=165}} including Spanish, Korean, Hebrew, and Hindi.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=74}} Two new editions were issued, first in 1956 then in 1962.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=504}} These new editions included updated [[bibliographies]] and clarified points; the last chapter, "Study of Literature in the Graduate School", was removed beginning in the second edition as Wellek and Warren considered the reforms suggested within already accomplished in several places.{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=408}} By 1976 Wellek was of the opinion that the book required updating, but asked rhetorically "who can master the astonishing and bewildering literature on theory which since [1949] has been produced in many countries?" and noted that he and Warren were busy with their own projects.{{sfn|Wellek|1976|p=75}}

==Reception==
Academic reception of ''Theory of Literature'' was mixed. The philologist Helmut Hatzfeld, reviewing shortly after the book's release, described ''Theory of Literature'' as "radical in its viewpoint, rich in ideas and bibliographical material, poised in its judgment of other approaches to literature"{{sfn|Hatzfeld|1949|p=277}} as well as a "landmark in literary studies."{{sfn|Hatzfeld|1949|p=281}} Although Hatzfeld agreed with Wellek and Warren's main points, he thought it lacking in references to theories and literature from the Romance languages{{sfn|Hatzfeld|1949|p=280}} and concrete interpretations.{{sfn|Hatzfeld|1949|p=278}} [[William Troy (writer and educator)|William Troy]], writing in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', echoed the sentiment, stating that, although the book was "unusually difficult" to read,{{sfn|Troy|1950|p=619}} he felt "unqualified agreement with the main position".{{sfn|Troy|1950|p=620}} He expected that the book would not succeed with "anyone ungifted from birth with some susceptibility to&amp;nbsp;... 'intrinsic' elements", a group which he believed comprised the majority of those teaching literature in the US.{{sfn|Troy|1950|p=620}} Seymour Betsky, writing in ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'', praised the book's summary and adjucation; he wrote that it was "in its way impressive", a "''tour de force''" which would "usher in a new era".{{sfn|Betsky|1949|p=260}} However, Betsky felt that the book lacked a "controlling purpose" and that it neglected to emphasize the need to differentiate between "the cheap commercial appeal and the genuine" literature.{{sfn|Betsky|1949|p=261}}

Edward G. Ballard, reviewing for ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', found the treatment lacking, with major terms left undefined and much of the book providing synopses of other writers' theories; he conceded, however, that it convincingly showed that "the intellectual study of literature ''qua'' literature has just begun".{{sfn|Ballard|1951|pp=109–110}} In ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'',&lt;!--Eliseo--&gt; Vivas wrote that the book's discussion of the relation between literary criticism and scholarship "leaves nothing to be desired", providing a "well balanced" look at the major points;{{sfn|Vivas|1950|p=162}} he found that no other such work existed in English at the time.{{sfn|Vivas|1950|p=165}} Vivas opined, however, that Wellek and Warren lacked a single, non-contradictory theory to use as a base for their conclusions.{{sfn|Vivas|1950|p=162}} Kemp Malone, reviewing for ''[[Linguistics (journal)|Linguistics]]'', discussed three chapters on elements of literature related to linguistics. He considered these to provide "food for thought" for linguists and suggested that Wellek was well-versed in linguistics for a professor of literature, despite misusing several terms common in the discipline.{{sfn|Malone|1950|pp=311–313}}

[[Newton Arvin]], writing in the ''[[Partisan Review]]'', found ''Theory of Literature'' to excessively indulge in [[formalism (literature)|formalism]] and expressed concern that the idea of literary history may have "gone into the discard once and for all".{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=400}} Benjamin found the book not something new, but a final assertion of the dominance of New Criticism in literary theory, a dominance which he considered untenable.{{sfn|Benjamin|1953|p=424}} Rather than emphasize theory, he found that ''Theory of Literature'' was "ninety-nine parts a 'good offense' against its slain and buried foes"{{sfn|Benjamin|1953|p=425}} with "exceptionally lucid and authoritative" discussions of literary problems.{{sfn|Benjamin|1953|p=427}} Scaglione opined that ''Theory of Literature''{{'s}} plain, imprecise language had introduced numerous inconsistencies within its theoretical framework;{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=402}} he also stated that the book led readers to believe they were approaching an understanding of literature without ever reaching the core essence of the subject.{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=404}}

Ingarden, who believed his theories the basis of Wellek and Warren's arguments, considered himself inadequately credited and took offense with the attribution of his ideas to "pure phenomenologists".{{sfn|Ingarden|Grabowicz|1979|pp=lxxix–lxxxiv}} He also stated that they had misrepresented his views.{{sfn|Ingarden|Grabowicz|1979|pp=lxxix–lxxxiv}} George Grabowicz, prefacing his translation of Ingarden's ''The Literary Work of Art'', suggested that ''Theory of Literature'' was "instrumental" in spreading Ingarden's ideas.{{sfn|Ingarden|Grabowicz|1979|p=lxiii}}

==Legacy==
At the time of publication Wellek and Warren considered ''Theory of Literature'' unparalleled in English-language publications,{{sfn|Parrinder|1993|pp=135–136}} an attempt to unite [[literary theory]], [[literary criticism|criticism]], [[literary history|history]], and scholarship.{{sfn|Wellek|Warren|1949|p=v}} Although they noted a similarity to existing German and Russian works, the authors considered those earlier works "eclectic" and "doctrinaire", respectively.{{sfn|Parrinder|1993|pp=135–136}} Ballard writes that ''Theory of Literature'' was published during a time of increasing focus on the art of literature, rather than its underlying philosophy.{{sfn|Ballard|1951|p=108}}

In an academic biography of Wellek, Michael Holquist of the [[University of Columbia]] writes that ''Theory of Literature'' established Wellek's reputation as a literary scholar{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=164}} for the next three decades.{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=163}} The book proved to be Wellek's only "book-length scholarly manifesto",{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=164}} a format which Holquist credits to Warren's influence.{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=176}} Wellek's other works were essays on literary theory and criticism which, even though bound in a single volume, did not provide a single coherent manifesto.{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=176}} Wellek would continue to use the theories contained in ''Theory of Literature'' into the late 1980s.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=505}}

The book was used to teach literary theory at universities beginning not long after publication{{sfn|Scaglione|1958|p=400}} and remained dominant into the mid-1960s,{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=172}} at which time an increasingly heterogeneous academia questioned the universal value of literature; literary theorist [[Terry Eagleton]] finds that, after the 1960s, "it was no longer possible to take for granted what what literature was, how to read it, or what social functions it might serve".{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=191}} Steven Mailloux describes ''Theory of Literature'' as crystallizing an American movement towards intrinsic literary criticism, as dominated by New Criticism,{{sfn|Mailloux|1984|p=51}} while van Rees credits the book with popularizing a text-oriented interpretation.{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=501}} Grabowicz writes that its importance for both American and general literary studies is "indisputable".{{sfn|Ingarden|Grabowicz|1979|p=lxiii}} Writing in 1987, Jeremy Hawthorn described the book as an "excellent introductory study", despite extrinsic studies having become more dominant in literary criticism,{{sfn|Parrinder|1993|pp=135–136}} while Holquist found that the book could still "be usefully invoked" in literary debates of the early 21st&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=165}} In an obituary of Wellek, Robert Thomas Jr. credited ''Theory of Literature'' with "introduc[ing] European scholarship to the United States" and establishing a framework for [[comparative literature]] studies in the United States.{{sfn|Thomas 1995, René Wellek}}

The theoretical positions promulgated in ''Theory of Literature'' have generally been criticized by later writers. Van Rees, for example, considers Wellek and Warren's distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of literature to be too sharply drawn, leading to the two aspects becoming [[binary opposition|binary opposites]].{{sfn|van Rees|1984|p=510}} Holquist notes that this distinction proceeds from a different understanding of literature. He writes that Wellek's school of thought considered literature as a "unified subject" with definite boundaries which could be mastered,{{sfn|Holquist|2010|p=165}} while more recent scholarship has rendered "[t]he very identity of literature as an object of study&amp;nbsp;... no longer clear."{{sfn|Bernheimer|1995|p=2|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Holquist|2010|p=166}}}}

[[File:Sample conworld.jpg|frame|A rendered constructed world as seen from [[outer space]]]]
'''Worldbuilding''' is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name=hamilton2009/&gt; The resulting world may be called a '''constructed world'''. Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a [[history]], [[Fictional geography|geography]], and [[ecology]] is a key task for many science fiction or [[fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian M. |last=Stableford |year=2004 |title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0-8108-4938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldbuilding often involves the creation of [[Fantasy map|map]]s, a [[backstory]], and people for the world.  Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and [[Cognitive training|mental exercise]], or for specific creative endeavors such as [[novel]]s, [[video game]]s, or [[role-playing game]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term "world-building" was first used in the ''Edinburgh Review'' in December 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in A.S. Eddington's ''Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory'' (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddington|first1=Arthur Stanley|title=Space, Time and Gravitation : an outline of the general relativity theory|date=1920|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegravita00eddirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used in [[science fiction]] and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoff’s ''Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199891405|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|editor=Jeff Prucher|page=270|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of literary fictional worlds was first examined by fantasy authors such as [[George MacDonald]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[C. S. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="MarkWolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation|author=Mark J.P. Wolf|isbn=9781136220814|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien addressed the issue in his essay ''On Fairy Stories'', where he stated that the "Secondary World" or "Sub-Creation" (the constructed world) is substantially different from the art of play-writing: "Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories"&gt;{{citation|title=On Fairy Stories|author=J. R. R. Tolkien|work=The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pp=109–161|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed worlds shift away from storytelling, narrative, characters and figures, and may explore "trees as trees" or aspects of the world in-and-of-themselves. Later analysis of fantasy worlds in the 1960s contextualized them in the medium or the narrative of the works, offering an analysis of the stories in the world, but not the world itself. [[Media franchise]]s are similar to constructed worlds but do not necessarily rely on them; for example a media franchise such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' has a constructed world, while [[The Beatles]], as a franchise, does not. In the 2000s, world-building in film has increased in popularity. When before, writers sought to create a character that could sustain multiple stories, now they create a world that can sustain multiple characters and stories.&lt;ref name="MarkWolf" /&gt;

==Methods==
Worldbuilding can be designed from [[Top-down and bottom-up design|the top down or the bottom up]], or by a combination of these approaches. The official world-building guidelines for ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' refer to these terms as "outside-in" and "inside-out", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first1=Monte |last1=Cook |authorlink1=Monte Cook |first2=Jonathan |last2=Tweet |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet |first3=Skip |last3=Williams |authorlink3=Skip Williams |others=revised by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] |year=2003 |title=[[Dungeon Master's Guide]] |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |isbn=0-7869-2889-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the top-down approach, the [[designer]] first creates a general overview of the world, determining broad characteristics such as the world's inhabitants, [[technology]] level, major geographic features, [[climate]], and history. From there, he or she develops the rest of the world in increasing detail. This approach might involve creation of the world's basics, followed by levels such as [[continent]]s, [[civilization]]s, [[Fictional country|nation]]s, [[Fictional city|cities]], and [[town]]s. A world constructed from the top down tends to be well-integrated, with individual components fitting together appropriately. It can, however, require considerable work before enough detail is completed for the setting to be useful, such as in the setting of a story.

With the bottom-up approach, the designer focuses on a small part of the world needed for his or her purposes. This location is given considerable detail, such as local geography, [[culture]], [[social structure]], [[government]], [[politics]], [[commerce]], and history. Prominent local individuals may be described, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] to each other. The surrounding areas are then described in a lower level of detail, with description growing more general with increasing distance from the initial location. The designer can subsequently enhance the description of other areas in the world. This approach provides for almost immediate applicability of the setting, with details pertinent to a certain story or situation. The approach can yield a world plagued with [[Consistency|inconsistencies]], however. By combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches, a designer can enjoy the benefits of both. This is very hard to accomplish, however, because the need to start from both sides creates twice as much work, which may delay the desired product.

Despite requiring considerable work to develop enough detail for a setting to be useful, not every aspect of a setting can be explored, and instead an approach called inferred world building is often used. Inferred world building is when the author provides enough detail about the various parts of a setting that readers can extrapolate on what is written to come to their own conclusions regarding specific details that weren't provided. This is especially useful for roleplaying game settings, as individual games may require certain details to be created on a case-by-case basis for the RPG's story to function.

==Elements==
From a game-design perspective, the goal of worldbuilding is to create the context for a story. Consistency is an important element, since the world provides a foundation for the action of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francois Dominic |last=Laramee |year=2002 |title=Game design perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |isbn=1-58450-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. R. Tolkien described the goal of worldbuilding as creating immersion, or "enchantment" as he put it, and descriptions of the world can be wholly disconnected from the story and narrative.&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories" /&gt;

An uninhabited world can be useful for certain purposes, especially in science fiction, but the majority of constructed worlds have one or more [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. These species can have [[constructed culture]]s and [[constructed language]]s. Designers in [[hard science fiction]] may design [[flora]] and [[fauna]] towards the end of the worldbuilding process, thus creating lifeforms with environmental adaptations to scientifically novel situations.

===Physics===
Perhaps the most basic consideration of worldbuilding is to what degree a fictional world will be based on real-world [[physics]] compared to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. While magic is a more common element of fantasy settings, science fiction worlds can contain magic or technological equivalents of it. For example, the Biotics in the science fiction video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' have abilities, described scientifically in-game, which mirror those of [[Magician (fantasy)|mages]] in fantasy games. In the science fiction novel ''[[Midnight at the Well of Souls]]'', magic exists, but is explained scientifically.

Some fictional worlds modify the real-world [[Physical law|laws of physics]]; [[faster-than-light]] travel is a common factor in much science fiction. Worldbuilding may combine physics and magic, such as in the ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

===Cosmology===
Constructed worlds often have cosmologies, both in the [[Physical cosmology|scientific]] and [[Religious cosmology|metaphysical]] senses of the word. Design of science fiction worlds, especially those with [[spacefaring]] societies, usually entails creation of a [[star system]] and [[planet]]s. If the designer wishes to apply real-life principles of astronomy, he or she may develop detailed [[Astronomy|astronomical]] measures for the [[orbit]] of the world, and to define the physical characteristics of the other bodies in the same system; this establishes [[Chronology|chronological]] parameters, such as the length of a day and the durations of [[season]]s.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book |first=Poul |last=Anderson |authorlink=Poul Anderson |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Worlds |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are intentionally bizarre. For [[Larry Niven]]'s novels ''[[The Integral Trees]]'' and ''[[The Smoke Ring (novel)|The Smoke Ring]]'', Niven designed a "freefall" environment, a gas [[torus]] ring of habitable pressure, temperature, and composition, around a [[neutron star]].

Fantasy worlds can also involve unique cosmologies. In ''Dungeons and Dragons'', the physical world is referred to as the Prime Material Plane, but other planes of existence devoted to moral or elemental concepts are available for play, such as the [[Spelljammer]] setting, which provides an entirely novel fantasy astrophysical system. Some fantasy worlds feature religions. The ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series, for example, contains a variety of religions practiced by its world's various races. The world of the 2000 video game ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' has a well-developed cosmology, including a [[creation myth]].

===Geography{{anchor|Map making}}===
Map construction is often one of the earliest tasks of worldbuilding. Maps can lay out a world's basic [[terrain]] features and significant civilizations present. A clear, concise map that displays the locations of key points in the story can be a helpful tool for developers and audiences alike. Finished creative products, such as books, may contain published versions of development maps; many editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for example, include maps of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cartography]] of fictional worlds is sometimes called ''geofiction''.&lt;ref name=map_hacks2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Schuyler |last1=Erle |first2=Rich |last2=Gibson |first3=Jo |last3=Walsh |isbn=0-596-00703-5 |page=508 |title=Mapping hacks: tips &amp; tools for electronic cartography |series=Hacks Series |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiO5JtP171oC&amp;pg=PA508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physical geography]] of a fictional world is important in designing [[weather]] patterns and [[biome]]s such as [[desert]]s, [[wetlands]], [[mountain]]s, and [[forest]]s. These physical features also affect the growth and interaction of the various societies, such as the establishment of [[trade route]]s and locations of important cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven S. |last=Long |year=2002 |title=Fantasy HERO |pages=290&amp;ndash;294 |edition=[[Hero System]] Fifth |publisher=DOJ |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58366-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for control of [[natural resource]]s in a fictional world may lead to [[war]] among its people. Geography can also define [[ecosystem]]s for each biome. Often, Earth-like ecology is assumed, but designers can vary drastically from this trend. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[short story]] "[[The Talking Stone]]" features a life form based on [[silicon]], rather than [[Carbon-based life|carbon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Clement |authorlink=Hal Clement |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Beings |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[software]] programs can create random terrain using [[fractal]] algorithms. Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plate movement and [[erosion]]; the resulting world can be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in great detail, providing a degree of realism to the result.

===Culture===
Constructed cultures, or concultures, are a typical element of worldbuilding. Worldbuilders sometimes employ past human civilizations as a model for fictional societies. The 1990 video game ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire]]'', for example, takes place in a world full of [[tribe]]s based on civilizations in early [[Mesoamerica]] and Africa. This method can make a fictional world more accessible for an audience. ''Simon Provencher'' has stated as a 'Golden Rule' of Worldbuilding that "... unless specified otherwise, everything inside your world is assumed to behave exactly as it would in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provencher|first=Simon|title=The Golden Rule of Worldbuilding|url=http://www.worldbuilderblog.com/the-golden-rule-of-worldbuilding/|work=Worldbuilder|publisher=Simon Provencher|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven S. Long]], a representative of the [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] role-playing game, who stated that "Everything that happened in the real world has also unfolded in the exact same way in the Champions Universe." This means any past wars, elections, and technological advancements in our world occurred the same way in the Champions Universe unless explained otherwise.  Creating a cohesive [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture can be a distinct challenge. Some designers have also looked to human civilizations for inspiration in doing so, such as ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, whose society resembles that of [[Ancient Rome]]. The fictional world's history can explain past and present relationships between different societies, which can introduce a story's action. A past war, for example, functions as a key plot point in the ''[[Shannara]]'' and ''[[Belgariad]]'' series.

==Types of constructed worlds==
Examples of constructed worlds include [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the pseudo-Earth [[Hyborian Age]] in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan series]], Arrakis in the ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series, the continent of [[Tamriel]] in the [[Elder Scrolls]] series of games,  [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and [[Gethen]], the Subcontinent of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the location of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Constructed worlds are not always limited to one type of story. [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] and [[Steven Brust]] created [[Ethshar]] and [[Dragaera]], respectively, for role-playing games before using them as settings for novels. [[M. A. R. Barker]] originally designed [[Tékumel]] well before the advent of role-playing games, but many [[gamer]]s, including Barker himself, have used it as a setting for such games.

A [[shared universe]] is a fictional universe that can be used by different authors. Examples of shared universes include the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] and [[campaign setting]] developed specifically for role-playing games. One of the oldest of these is [[Oerth]], developed for the Dungeons and Dragons [[Greyhawk]] setting. [[Forgotten Realms]] is another such D&amp;D setting, originally a [[House rule#Gaming|homebrew]] campaign world by [[Ed Greenwood]].

The ''' ''xenia'' motif''' in Roman [[mosaic]] is a [[still life]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a grouping of various items, mostly edible, representing a generous offering (a ''xenia'') from a wealthy host to his guests.  The items are often spread across different compartments in floor mosaic schemes. No doubt there were once paintings, but these have been lost.

Typical elements of a ''xenia'' motif include game hanging from hooks, fish, baskets of fruit (often overturned), and the like. [[Vitruvius]] lists specifically "poultry, eggs, vegetables, and other country produce".&lt;ref&gt;''[[de Architectura]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/6*.html#7.4 VI:7:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xenia'' motifs are typically found in reception rooms.

[[Xenia (Greek)|The word ''xenia'']] is Greek, and means 'hospitality'; in Latin, it came to mean presents for guests, and later presents in general. It also came to include a class of [[epigram]]matic inscription attached to the presents, [[xenia epigram]]s.
