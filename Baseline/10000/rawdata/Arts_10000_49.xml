'''''A Burial At Ornans''''' ({{lang-fr|Un enterrement à Ornans}}, also known as '''''A Funeral At Ornans''''') is a painting of 1849–50 by [[Gustave Courbet]], and one of the major turning points of 19th-century [[French art]].  The painting records the funeral in September 1848 of his great-uncle in the painter's birthplace, the small town of [[Ornans]].&lt;ref&gt;Population 3304 in the 1846 census,  [http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/nomenclatures/cog/fichecommunale.asp?codedep=25&amp;codecom=434 INSEE commune file]&lt;/ref&gt; It treats an ordinary provincial funeral with unflattering realism, and on the giant scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of [[history painting]]. Its exhibition at the 1850–51 [[Paris Salon]] created an "explosive reaction" and brought Courbet instant fame.&lt;ref&gt;Pbs.org. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/visualarts/courbet_a.html Gustave Courbet's A Burial at Ornans]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently displayed at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, France.

The Salon&lt;ref&gt;Political turmoil delayed the opening of the Salon of 1850 until 30 December 1850. Faunce, Sarah; Courbet, Gustave; and Nochlin, Linda 1988, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; found Courbet triumphant with  ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', the ''Peasants of Flagey'', and ''A Burial at Ornans''.  People who had attended the funeral were used as models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives; here Courbet said that he "painted the very people who had been present at the interment, all the townspeople". The result is a realistic presentation of them, and of life, in Ornans. 

The painting, which drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public, is an enormous work, measuring 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters), depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which previously would have been reserved for a work of [[history painting]]. According to art historian Sarah Faunce, "In Paris the ''Burial'' was judged as a work that had thrust itself into the grand tradition of history painting, like an upstart in dirty boots crashing a genteel party, and in terms of that tradition it was of course found wanting."&lt;ref&gt;Faunce, Sarah, and [[Linda Nochlin]]. ''Courbet reconsidered. Issued on the occasion of an exhibition to open at the Brooklyn Museum Nov. 4, 1988 - Jan. 16, 1989, the Minneapolis Inst. of Arts Febr. 18 - April 30, 1989''. Brooklyn, NY: Brooklyn Museum, 1988, p. 4. {{ISBN|0-300-04298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then too, the painting lacks the sentimental rhetoric that was expected in a [[genre works|genre work]]: Courbet's mourners make no theatrical gestures of grief, and their faces seem more caricatured than ennobled. The critics accused Courbet of a deliberate pursuit of ugliness. Eventually, the public grew more interested in the new Realist approach, and the lavish, decadent fantasy of [[Romanticism]] lost popularity. The artist well understood the importance of this painting; Courbet said: "The Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism."&lt;ref name=GMack&gt;{{cite book|last=Mack|first=Gerstle|title=Gustave Courbet|year=1989|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=9780306803758|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dx2G6f5iBYoC&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might also be said to be the burial of the [[hierarchy of genres]] which had dominated French art since the 17th century. 

In 1873, when Courbet's political views had changed, he repudiated the work saying that it was "worth nothing".&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 669. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adliya''' (Arabic: العدلية) is the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] neighborhood in [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]].

==Overview==
The district is a multicultural, busy area, a home to commerce, culture and entertainment, and it is considered as one of the four centres of Manama's nightlife. In the last few years, many of the old townhouses have been turned into [[Art gallery|art galleries]], cafes and ''chic'' restaurants, causing some analysts to term the area as being [[bourgeois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Al Hasan|first=Hasan|title="Chicken nuggets": Bahrain’s lost generation goes mainstream|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/hasan-tariq-al-hasan/%E2%80%9Cchicken-nuggets%E2%80%9D-bahrain%E2%80%99s-lost-generation-goes-mainstream|publisher=Open Democracy|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Jenny|title=Oman, UAE &amp; Arabian Peninsula.|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Vic.|isbn=9781741791457|pages=118|url=https://books.google.com.bh/books?id=D8hmZIAaTGQC&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Adliya&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q=Adliya&amp;f=false|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the developing trend, Adliya is known for its clustered cafes, art galleries, bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants, including popular venues, such as BJ's, JJ's, Lilou's, The Meat Co. and Candle's. Adliya attracts many local residents and tourists alike.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==Galleries==
The district is the heartland of art galleries in Bahrain. Notable galleries in the area include the Albareh art gallery, Al Riwaq art gallery, Kalabhavan Bahrain institute amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Galleries in Adliya|url=http://www.timeoutbahrain.com/art/search/adliya|publisher=Time Out Bahrain|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Abode of art' opens in Adliya|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=100087|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=Gulf Daily News|date=30 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arles: View from the Wheat Fields''''' (also known as ''Wheat Field with Sheaves and Arles in the Background'') was painted by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in June, 1888, among a number of paintings he made of wheat fields that summer. It is currently displayed at the [[Musee Rodin]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

==Arles==

Van Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France.  There he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as ''Harvest at La Crau.''  The [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflower paintings]], some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time.  He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings.  This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.  He was confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Arts Entwined: Music and Painting in the Nineteenth Century | first1=M | last1=Morton | first2=P | last2=Schmunk |  publisher=Garland Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | isbn=0-8153-3156-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NP724mFE1MC&amp;pg=PA177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as [[Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]] and Japanese art (see [[Japonism]]) from his period in Paris the prior two years.  His style evolved into one with vivid colors and energetic, [[impasto]] brush strokes.&lt;ref name="Honolulu"/&gt;

==Wheat fields==
The close association of peasants and the cycles of nature particularly interested Van Gogh, such as the sowing of seeds, harvest and sheaves of wheat in the fields.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night | author=van Gogh, V | author2=van Heugten, S | author3=Pissarro, J | author4=Stolwijk, C  | publisher=Mercatorfonds with Van Gogh Museum and Museum of Modern Art | location=Brusells | year=2008 | pages=12, 25 | isbn=978-0-87070-736-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PipnXcXe5TQC&amp;pg=PA12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh saw plowing, sowing and harvesting symbolic to man's efforts to overwhelm the cycles of nature: "the sower and the wheat sheaf stood for eternity, and the reaper and his [[scythe]] for irrevocable death." The dark hours conducive to germination and regeneration are depicted in ''The Sower'' and wheat fields at sunset.&lt;ref name="van Heugten"/&gt;

In 1889 Van Gogh wrote of the way in which wheat was symbolic to him: "What can a person do when he thinks of all the things he cannot understand, but look at the fields of wheat... We, who live by bread, are we not ourselves very much like wheat... to be reaped when we are ripe."&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/landscape-saint-r%C3%A9my-enclosed-field-peasant-gogh-vincent-van |title=Landscape at Saint-Rémy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) |author= |year=2010 |work=Collection |publisher= |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvest paintings==
During the last half of June he worked on a group of ten "Harvest" paintings,&lt;ref name=Honolulu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honoluluacademy.org/art/5394-wheat-fielda_z |title=Wheat Field |author= |year= |work=Collection | publisher=Honolulu Academy of Art |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed him to experiment with color and technique. "I have now spent a week working hard in the wheatfields, under the blazing sun," Van Gogh wrote on 21 June 1888 to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].&lt;ref name="VGM WF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2595&amp;lang=en |title=Wheat Fields |author= |year= |work=Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the series of wheat fields as "…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping."&lt;ref name=NGASun&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |pages=18 | publisher=National Gallery of Art | location=Washington, D.C. | url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==
''Arles: View from the Wheat Fields''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/5/Arles:-View-from-the-Wheat-Fields.html |title=Arles: View from the Wheat Fields |author= |year= |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents the harvest.  In the foreground are sheaves of harvested wheat leaning against one another.

Across the horizon is the town of Arles.&lt;ref name=Beaujean/&gt;   Van Gogh described the series of wheat fields as "…landscapes, yellow—old gold—done quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the blazing sun, intent only on the reaping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900)|pages=18 |publisher=National Gallery of Art | location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Gogh used landscape-format for all of his ''[[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|Wheat Fields]]'' paintings, the one exception was this painting which was made in portrait-format.&lt;ref name=Beaujean&gt;{{cite book | author=Beaujean, D | year=2000 | title=Van Gogh: Life and Work | location=Cologne | publisher =Konemann | isbn=3-8290-2938-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pano Plazo Botero.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Plaza Botero is a popular tourist site for taking pictures.]]
Throughout his career, Fernando Botero has donated several artworks to museums in [[Bogotá]] and his hometown of Medellín. In 2000, Botero donated 123 pieces of his work and 85 pieces from his personal collection to a museum in Bogota. This included works from other artists, including works by [[Chagall]], [[Picasso]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and the French impressionists.&lt;ref name="LaRosaMejía2012" /&gt; He also donated 119 pieces to the Museum of Antioquia.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorrain Caputo|title=VIVA Colombia Adventure Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c16G3Z9EtgcC&amp;pg=PT624|publisher=Viva Publishing Network|isbn=978-1-937157-05-0|pages=624–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four more of his sculptures can be found in Medellín's [[Berrío Park]] and San Antonio Plaza.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Sculptures==
[[File:Alumbrado 2011 - Plaza Botero-01.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|The plaza illuminated during the [[Christmas lights in Medellín|Christmas season]] ''(2011)'']]
The sculptures are all made out of bronze. Many of them were previously housed in museums of Paris, New York, and Madrid. The sculptures tend to have simple names, such as "The Hand", "Eve", "Maternity", "Man on horseback", and "Roman Soldier" to name a few. The "Botero legend" suggests that rubbing the statues brings love and good fortune.&lt;ref name="Michelin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelin|title=Colombia Green Guide Michelin 2012-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPUPB37Ifl8C&amp;pg=PT286|date=1 March 2011|publisher=MICHELIN|isbn=978-2-06-718208-0|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burrell Collection''' is an art collection in the city of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. It is situated in [[Pollok Country Park]] on the south side of the city. The museum closed for refurbishment on 23 October 2016 and is expected to reopen in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-37739424&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Figure of a Luohan from the Chenghua period..JPG|thumb|left|Figure of a Luohan from the Chenghua period]]
The eclectic collection was acquired over many years by [[William Burrell|Sir William Burrell]], a wealthy Glaswegian shipping magnate and art collector, who then gave it to the city of [[Glasgow Corporation]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/burrell_museum.htm |title=The Burrell Museum, Burrell Collection, Glasgow Museum |accessdate=17 February 2008 |date= |work= |publisher=Glasgowarchitecture.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gift was made on the condition that the collection was to be housed in a building 16&amp;nbsp;miles (26&amp;nbsp;km) from the centre of Glasgow, to show the works to their greatest advantage, and to avoid the damaging effects of air pollution at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/sc000074&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees spent over 20 years trying to find a suitable 'home' for the collection, one which met all the criteria set out in the Trust Deed, without success. Eventually, when the [[Pollok Country Park|Pollok Estate]] was given to the city in 1967, the Trustees had certain terms of the deed waived, which allowed the current site, 3&amp;nbsp;miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the city centre and within the city boundaries, to be chosen for the collection.&lt;ref name=museums&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/venue/index.cfm?venueid=1 |title=The Burrell Collection |accessdate=17 February 2008 |author=  |date= |work= |publisher=[[Glasgow Museums]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
A design competition for the museum building in 1971 was delayed by a postal strike, allowing time for the eventual winning architect [[Barry Gasson]] to complete his entry, designed in collaboration with John Meunier and [[Brit Andresen]].

The building is L-shaped in plan and is specifically tailored to house and display the diverse collection, with larger pieces such as Romanesque doorways built into the structure, at the same time giving views out into the park over formal grassed areas to the south, and into adjacent woodland to the north.

The entrance, through a 16th-century stone archway built into a modern red sandstone gable, leads to a shop and other facilities, then on to a central courtyard under a glazed roof, adjacent to the reconstructions of three rooms from the Burrell's home, [[Hutton Castle]] near [[Berwick-on-Tweed]]: the wood panelled drawing room, hall, and dining room complete with their furnishings. Galleries on two levels house various smaller artefacts, over a basement storage level, and at the lower level a restaurant gives views over the lawn to the south.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

The museum was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1983, and was named as [[Prospect 100 best modern Scottish buildings|Scotland's second greatest post-war building]] (after [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia]]'s [[St Peter's Seminary, Cardross|St Peter's Seminary]]) in a poll of architects by [[Prospect (architecture magazine)|Prospect]] magazine in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The building was awarded A-listed status by Historic Scotland in February 2013 in recognition of its position as one of the country’s finest examples of 1970s architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/burrell_collection.htm |title=Burrell Collection - Glasgow Museum Building |publisher=Glasgowarchitecture.co.uk |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burrell contains an important collection of [[medieval art]] including [[stained glass]] and [[tapestries]], oak furniture, [[medieval weapons]] and [[armour]], [[Islamic art]], artefacts from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient China|China]], [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] works by [[Degas]] and [[Cézanne]], [[modern sculpture]] and a host of other artefacts from around the world, all collected by one man.&lt;ref name=museums/&gt;  There are over 8,000 objects in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/burrell-collection/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Artworks from five centuries are found in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/painting-and-drawing/art473179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese art===
Burrell started collecting Chinese antiques around 1910. He acquired items from all periods of Chinese history; including [[Burial urn#Cremation urns|Neolithic burial urns]], carved jades, porcelain from the [[T'ang Dynasty]], bronze ritual vessels, [[earthenware]] figures, and antique furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carp.arts.gla.ac.uk/essay1.php?enum=1097070125 |title=CARP: From Collector To Connoisseur: Sir William Burrell and Chinese Art, 1911–57 |publisher=Carp.arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic art===
Islamic antiques donated by Burrell to the museum include: [[Hispano-Moresque ware|Hispano-Moresque lustreware]], ceramics and carpets from Iran and the [[Mughal Empire]], as well as [[Embroidery|embroideries]] and textiles from Turkey and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus04;uk&amp;type=museum&amp;theme=ISL&amp; |title=Discover Islamic Art – Virtual Museum |publisher=Discoverislamicart.org |date= |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Ancient Egypt's hall at the Burrell Collection, Glasgow..JPG|thumb|The Ancient Egypt hall]]
===Stained glass===
The museum is home to one of the greatest assemblies of medieval stained glass in the world. There are more than 700 stained glass panels from across Europe in the collection, including many examples of Gothic, Renaissance and Romanesque styles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cannon-macinnes.co.uk/linda-cannon/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the glass has [[heraldry|heraldic]] motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Stephen|editor-last= Friar|title= A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location= London|year= 1987|publisher= [[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn= 0 906670 44 6|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a project was commenced to conserve and research the museum's collection of stained glass from the [[Carmelite]] church at Boppard-am-Rhein, Germany. The 34 panels that make up the Burrell collection of Boppard windows have a combined surface area of 14 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Conservation Project Under Way at The Burrell Collection|url=http://vidimus.org/blogs/news/new-conservation-project-underway-at-the-burrell-collection/|date=17 Apr 2013|journal=Vidimus|issue=68|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gothic art===
The museum has a collection of religious art from the medieval period.  This includes wood and stone sculptures, wooden church furnishings and architectural fragments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/burrell-collection/the-collection/Pages/The-Collection.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One of these items is the [[Temple Pyx]].

'''Cleveland Orenthal Brown Jr.''' is a character in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite episode |people=[[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]], [[Matt Weitzman]] (writers); Jack Dyer (director)|title=Love Thy Trophy |series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy|network=Fox |date=March 14, 2000|season=2|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Cleveland Brown]] and his late ex-wife [[Loretta Brown|Loretta]]. On ''Family Guy'', he was depicted as slim and hyperactive; however, on ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' he is shown to have undergone a marked transformation, both in terms of a significant increase in weight and a newly subdued personality. He was voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] in ''Family Guy'' and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in ''The Cleveland Show'' and on the character's return to the former show.

At 14 years old, Junior is the only child of [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Loretta Brown]], stepson of [[Donna Tubbs]], and the stepbrother of [[Roberta Tubbs|Roberta]] and [[Rallo Tubbs]]. Junior's most prominent character traits are his laziness, obesity, and low social intelligence (although there are occasional references to him being academically bright). He has obtained poor eyesight over the years and now wears glasses. Since his parents' divorce, Loretta gave custody of Cleveland Jr. back to Cleveland and forced him to move. Thus, the pair left for California. However, en route, they decided to live in Stoolbend, Virginia instead, where Cleveland married Donna Tubbs, and Rallo and Roberta became his step-siblings.

==Role in ''The Cleveland Show''==
Cleveland Jr. is a frequent target of weight related jokes from a variety of characters in the series, in particular Rallo, his step-brother. When Rallo met Cleveland Jr. and his father he would often call them "fat". In the second episode, Cleveland Jr. served as a door in the bathroom so that he could earn his classmates' respect, which angered Cleveland. He also exudes a nervous and overly sensitive nature, and seems to have a fear of toasters as the toaster in his house scares and taunts him (akin to [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and the monkey in his closet).

It is revealed in "[[Birth of a Salesman (The Cleveland Show)|Birth of a Salesman]]" that Cleveland Jr. has repressed emotions from the divorce of his parents and has in fact never cried before. He has also revealed resentment towards his own mother, Loretta, for cheating on his father with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] back in "[[The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire]]". Feeling bad for the way they treated him, Roberta and Rallo help Cleveland Jr. to express his sadness and at the same time the three of them accepted one another as family. In "[[The Hurricane!]]", Junior reveals that he had lost faith in God after learning from Loretta that Jesus forgave her for her affair with Glenn Quagmire that lead to her divorcing Cleveland. He also states that he [[Nontheism|does not believe in God]], although he claims he is not an [[atheism|atheist]] either, which he calls  atheism "a religion, too". However, in later episodes he explicitly identifies as an atheist without any such qualification. Yet in "[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown]]", he tells Rallo that he is reading ''[[Blubber (novel)|Blubber]]'' by [[Judy Blume]] because they don't have the Quran, implying that he may be a [[Muslim]].

Junior's obesity and low self-esteem makes it difficult for him to find friends. In "[[Da Doggone Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance]]", he seems to become friends with Derek, Laine, Reggie and Kyle, although this is solely due to his agreeing to act as a replacement bathroom door as, in later episodes, Derek, Laine and Reggie continue to bully Junior, often under the lead of Oliver Wilkerson. In "The One About Friends", Cleveland Jr. creates an actual friendship with Lester Krinklesac's son, Ernie. He shared a kiss with Laura Davis at the Stoolbend Community Church's chastity ball.

While Junior is not as active as he was in ''Family Guy'', he has other hobbies and interests; he enjoys [[science]], playing the [[tuba]] in the Stoolbend High School [[school band]], and is the leader of a troop of Freedom Scouts, Stoolbend's version of the [[Boy Scouts]]. Derek nominated him for student-council president as a joke, but, after saving Oliver Wilkerson's life, he won. Additionally, while he may not know much when it comes to social situations, he is an excellent student attending Stoolbend High School along with his older sister, Roberta.

A scene in a "[[A Rodent Like This]]" suggests that ''The Cleveland Show''{{'}}s Junior has a dark double life. He reveals to Rallo that he is a secret agent who killed the original Cleveland Jr. (as drawn in the first four seasons of ''Family Guy'') in order to be placed in the Brown family. This gag is not followed up in later episodes, suggesting that it was either real or an elaborate prank on Rallo out of annoyance the latter was determined to find out what was in Jr.'s suitcase earlier in the episode that led to the top-secret organization.

Cleveland Brown Jr. is married to Cecilia, as shown in "Y Tu Junior También", to prevent her deportation.

==Character==

===Creation===
Cleveland Jr. debuted in the ''Family Guy'' [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Love Thy Trophy]]", but only made a handful more appearances thereafter. He was presumably taken into Loretta's custody after she divorced Cleveland in "[[The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire]]" and has since undergone a major character reinvention upon becoming a leading character in ''The Cleveland Show''. After Cleveland and Loretta's divorce is finalized in the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|pilot episode of ''The Cleveland Show'']], Junior is placed in Cleveland's custody, and they move out of [[Quahog, Rhode Island]] to [[Stoolbend, Virginia]] where Cleveland rekindles a relationship with, and subsequently marries, his high school sweetheart, Donna Tubbs. His recent status is pronounced deceased as the he has abandon life support unit (LSU) in Season 10 EP 4 "The Cookie Club"  and is seen sleeping in the woods, without his life support unit he probably died during nightfall. Before Cleveland would noticed, as he and his wife Donna go out for a drink every night.

===Design===
[[File:Cleveland Jr (FamilyGuy).png|130px|left|thumb|Cleveland Jr. as he appeared prior to 2009.]]
In ''Family Guy'' Cleveland Jr. is an active child of average size, but in ''The Cleveland Show'' he has aged, gained weight, appears potentially smarter, and wears glasses. In ''Family Guy'', he wears a purple T-shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers, but in ''The Cleveland Show'', he wears a red T-shirt, blue shorts, sneakers and glasses. He is also notably shorter, as ''Family Guy'' shows him to be of average height for his age, while in ''The Cleveland Show'', he appears to be no more than 5 ft. at the age of 14.

Cleveland Jr. was a minor character who had a short time with [[Peter Griffin]] in the episode, "[[Fore Father]]", where he showed a talent for playing [[golf]]. After that episode, he made short appearances later in the show, with his last on ''Family Guy'', until 2010 at his father's supposed funeral, along with Loretta.

===Voice===
[[File:Kevin Michael Richardson by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Kevin Michael Richardson has voiced Junior as of 2009.]]
Junior's voice is provided by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], who voices other characters on ''The Cleveland Show'', including Lester Krinklesac, Julius, and P-Hound. In ''Family Guy'', Junior's voice is provided by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]].

Richardson stated that he describes voicing Cleveland Jr. as "a character he did on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' named Patrick, who was mentally impaired and wore a football helmet."&lt;ref name="voicesbehind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20309493,00.html|title=The Voices Behind 'Cleveland'|date=2 October 2009|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show aired in 2009, the show's panel appeared at the 2009 [[Comic Con International]], and held a discussion about the show. When describing Junior's change in physical appearance and age, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] said "Cleveland Jr. really didn't have much to him and so he didn't appear for a while and so we sort of aged him up and made room for [[Rallo Tubbs|Rallo]] to be the younger one for a while."&lt;ref name="ccicleveland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22408|title=CCI: The Cleveland Show|last=Cronan|first=Mark|date=5 August 2009|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's creators later gave an explanation of Junior's altered look in "[[A Rodent Like This]]., although to some it may see unrealistic even in the context of the show (Cleveland Jr. as an operative of a crime-fighting entity run by ex-CIA agents deemed, as Junior says, "too extreme by the agency". It is even a possibility that this was all a joke, even in the program's context, because in the episode "Cleveland Live!" it is said that the characters basically run the show, and assist with the writing; this is obviously not true because these characters are fictional.

'''Edmonton Contemporary Artists' Society''' ('''ECAS''') is an international artists' exhibition collective founded in 1993, based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

==Background==
[[File:Spanish Castle.jpg|thumb|Edmonton Contemporary Artists' Society's 9th Annual Exhibition, 2001]]
Since the 1920s, artists in English Canada had been heavily influenced by the landscape painting of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] and the [[Eastern Group of Painters]]. In [[Quebec]], [[John Goodwin Lyman]] founded The Contemporary Arts Society in 1939, promoting post-impressionist and fauvist art.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;Terry Fenton, ''"ECAS And What It Stands For"'', ECAS 15th Annual Exhibition catalogue essay&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] spearheaded the modernist collective known as [[Les Automatistes]], which began having exhibitions as early as 1941. However, their artistic influence was not quickly felt in English Canada, or indeed much beyond [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Norwell, Iris. (2011), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgvrHdQ_iXEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Painters%20Eleven&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Painters Eleven:The Wild Ones of Canadian Art]'', Publishers Group West, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Painters Eleven]] (1953 - 1960) was founded in [[Toronto]] to promote their members' abstract works. [[Regina Five]] is the name given to five abstract painters, [[Kenneth Lochhead]], [[Arthur McKay]], [[Douglas Morton]], [[Ted Godwin]], and [[Ronald Bloore]], who displayed their works in the 1961 [[National Gallery of Canada]]'s exhibition "Five Painters from Regina". Though not an organized group per se, the name stuck with the 'members' and the artists would continue to show together.&lt;ref name="Fenton" /&gt;

[[File:ECAS show 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Edmonton Contemporary Artists' Society's 20th Annual Exhibition, 2013]]
The Edmonton Contemporary Artists' Society was formed in 1993 by a group of abstract artists working in Edmonton, Alberta. Founding artists include sculptor [[Peter Hide]] and painters, Terrence Keller,&lt;ref name="EJ"&gt;[http://www.edmontonjournal.com/ECAS+Exhibition+Enterprise+Square/8322142/story.html Edmonton Journal, "ECAS Exhibition at Enterprise Square," April 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Scott, Mitchel Smith and Graham Peacock.&lt;ref name="Fenton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Peacock&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed in order that contemporary art in [[Edmonton]] would be seen annually in light of a decline in possibility for exposure by the City and Provincial galleries. The inaugural ECAS exhibition was held at the City Centre Building in Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottgallery.com/peterhidecv.htm Peter Hide Biography, Scott Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; 
ECAS formerly published a newsletter which featured "an interview with an artist, critic or collector" in each issue, including such notable figures such as [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/interview.html Clement Greenberg, "Edmonton Interview," THE EDMONTON CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS' SOCIETY NEWSLETTER Vol 3, Issue 2 &amp; Vol 4 Issue 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The society's 15th annual show, in 2007, was hailed as one of their most diverse and successful exhibitions.&lt;ref name="DIV"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=79d04f2e-2e8d-4a56-950b-d30eda151a85 Artists' Society About to Mount One of its Most Diverse Showings," Edmonton Journal, September 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Membership in ECAS is dynamic: some artists have left, and new artists have joined. ECAS includes artists from within Edmonton, as well as locations beyond in Canada, the US, England, and Germany.&lt;ref name="Fenton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EJ" /&gt; Some of the artists who have exhibited with ECAS in its history include: César Alvarez, [[Walter Darby Bannard]], Douglas Bentham, Russell Bingham, Hendrik Bres, [[Anthony Caro]], Nola Cassady, Brenda Christiansen, Robert Christie, Ann Clarke, Scott Cumberland, James Davies, Dick Der, Michèle Drouin, Bruce Dunbar, Edward Epp, Gerald Faulder, [[Terry Fenton]], John Griefen, [[Peter Hide]], Bernard Hippel, Terrence Keller, Bianca Khan, John King, John Link, Sheila Luck, Kara Nina Maehler, Ruby J.

'''Ephraim Moses Lilien''' (1874–1925) was an [[art nouveau]] [[illustrator]] and [[printmaker]] particularly noted for his art on Jewish themes. He is sometimes called the "first [[Zionist]] artist."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph3/articles_assaph3/11finkelstein.pdf Haim Finkelstein, Lilien and Zionism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414135819/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph3/articles_assaph3/11finkelstein.pdf |date=2004-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ephraim Moses Lilien (''Maurycy Lilien'') was born in 1874,in [[Drohobycz]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]],&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"&gt;Werner, Alfred; Radjai-Ordoubadi, Jihan (2007). "Lilien, Ephraim Moses." ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol. 13, p. 14. Retrieved via ''Gale Virtual Reference Library'' database, 18 May 2018. Also available online via ''[https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lilien-ephraim-moses Encyclopedia.com].&lt;/ref&gt; then in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In 1889-1893 Lilien learned painting and graphic techniques at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Arts in Kraków]]. He studied under Polish painter [[Jan Matejko]] from 1890 to 1892.

As a member of the [[Zionist Movement]], Lilien traveled to [[Palestine (region)#Ottoman rule(1841–1917)|Ottoman Palestine]] several times between 1906 and 1918.&lt;ref name="hasencleverart1"&gt;[http://www.hasencleverart.com/artists/lilien.html On Ephraim Moses Lilien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314062958/http://www.hasencleverart.com/artists/lilien.html |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lilien attended the Fifth [[Zionist Congress]], held in [[Basel]], as a member of the Democratic Fraction, an opposition group that supported the development of secular national culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Stanley Friedman|Friedman, Maurice S.]] (1988). ''[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=yOp5uXpqEb4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=lilien+belonged+to+democratic+fraction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6KGCFaGFPh&amp;sig=OiZ9a0LxZumYmzkNLd9dTX1yQfM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXtNWlqcjWAhXFyRQKHZA0BOIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lilien%20belonged%20to%20democratic%20fraction&amp;f=false Martin Buber's Life and Work]''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0814319475}}. p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, at the Seventh Zionist Congress, in Basel, he, along with [[Boris Schatz]], became a member of a committee formed to help establish the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Art School]].&lt;ref name="EncyclJudaica"/&gt; As part of that work he accompanied Schatz to  [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

==Art career==
Lilien was one of the two artists to accompany Boris Schatz to what is now [[Israel]] in 1906 for the purpose of establishing [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]], and taught the school's first class in 1906. Although his stay in the country was short-lived, he left his indelible stamp on the creation of an Eretz Israel style, placing biblical subjects in the Zionist context and oriental settings, conceived in an idealized Western design. In the first two decades of the century, Lilien's work served as a model for the [[Bezalel school|Bezalel group]].

Lilien is known for his famous photographic portrait of [[Theodor Herzl]]. He often used Herzl as a model, considering his features a perfect representation of the "New Jew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exhibits.gelman.gwu.edu/expressions/herzl.htm |title=Artistic Expressions of the Jewish Renaissance|publisher=George Washington University Libraries}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, he received an award for photography from the avantgarde magazine ''[[Jugend]]''. Lilien illustrated several books. In 1923, an exhibition of his work opened in New York.&lt;ref name="hasencleverart1"/&gt;

Lilien's illustrated books include ''Juda'' (1900), Biblically-themes poetry by Lilien's Christian friend, Börries Freiherr von Münchausen, and ''Lieder des Ghetto'' (Songs of the Ghetto) (1903), Yiddish poems by Morris Rosenfeld translated into German.

Lilien died in [[Badenweiler]], [[Germany]] in 1925. A street in the [[Nayot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem is named for him.

[[File:Nerva - Smells Like a Pillow.jpg|thumb|Nerva - Smells Like a Pillow]]
'''Estonian art''' is art that comes from [[Estonia]], from Estonian artists or art pieces relating to Estonia. Estonian art is said to have started since the [[Stone Age]] time (9000 – 4200 B.C.). The Stone Age era art was found in caves and natural underground tunnel systems, these paintings were found all over Estonia.
Estonian art is mostly realism but Estonia also has surrealism. Estonian art from the 1200s to the 1500s are quick, simplistic and flat, they would only have 2 subjects in the foreground and the background would be the interesting feature by holding all the information in each image. The art depicts mostly common situations such as a picnic or a family dinner.

==History==
===Prehistoric art===
[[Cave paintings]] were the first pieces of art, they were found in caves and underground tunnels. Ancestral farmers and gatherers would use blood, bone marrow and crushed up animal hair to add pigmentation to the illustrations. For example, they used blood to make prey look different from the hunters.
Eventually they started incorporating wood into their tools and started making more accurate illustrations and paintings by making brushes from wood and animal hair.

===Gothic art===
[[Gothic art]] in Estonia was mostly found in churches and cathedrals, these churches and cathedrals had paintings and sculptures of religious figures in them. Most of them had Christian symbolism in paintings (most of which were over 8 feet tall); these painting would show Jesus and his disciples in a very artistic and symmetrical way. The Gothic Age in Estonia started around 1200 and ended around 1600, the art paintings from the start of this era were paintings about gods and their disciples (mostly portraying Jesus). 
[[The Church of the Holy Spirit]], one of more famous churches found in Estonia, has a Gothic interior and exterior. The art on the sides of the loft (above the pews) is about Jesus and his journey to enlighten people.  The paintings do not have a known artist but it is known that the artist painted them in the first half of the 1300s.

===Medieval===
Most of the Estonian art in the medieval period (mid-1500s to the 1700s) was inspired by Swedish art. The medieval art style would show the concepts of death and battle. Most pieces of art from this era would be flat and would not resemble reality. The art pieces would have skeletons and walking corpses, these would symbolize the death of people from the wars they had with the Swedish forces.

===Soviet era===
[[File:Suur Toll Ninase.jpg|thumb|Suur Toll Ninase]]
During the Soviet rule (from 1940-1991), the art movement of socialist realism emerged. Socialist realism would show the struggles of the people that were affected by Soviet rule; it would show the struggles of the middle to lower class households in workplace scenarios or as a family in a home.  This period of art was not as popular when compared to other art periods.

===The Great World Wars===
The most notable work is [[The Bronze Soldier]] (made by [[Enn Roos]] and Supervising architect [[Arnold Alas]]) it was unveiled on the 22 September 1947 on the second anniversary of the Soviet Red Army re-entering [[Tallinn]] in September 1944. It was originally a war memorial for the people lost in the Second World War, and was moved between several war graves, but subsequently was put at the Tallinn military cemetery where it still resides.

===Post independence era===
Estonia started [[surreal art]] from early 1900 and is quite renowned in comparison to other countries in the region. This era of art is one of the hardest to plot in skill due to the vast variety each art piece conveys but this then led to the next art style. [[Modernism]] started in the early 1900s but did not get famous until around the 1950s in Estonia. Estonia is well known for its modernist paintings and illustrations.  Most of the post-independence art is modern and talks about the struggles of the past; some depict the most notable moment in Estonian art, the day of their fight for independence. After modern art, Estonia is going through the phase of [[contemporary art]] style as of this moment. Contemporary art is a style of art of the 20th and 21st century, it is an art style that does not have boundaries like other styles.
One recent contemporary artists is [[Nelly Drell]], A well-known artist, she is mostly known for her paintings. She was born on October 19, 1979 where she would build her artistic talent growing up in the capitol city Tallinn. She got her bachelors from the [[University of Miami]] and her masters from the [[New York Academy of Art]], getting a degree in painting. One of her paintings called “Estonian peacekeepers in Iraq” was made in 2005 and shows the struggles of the Estonian people and their involvements in the war in Iraq.

'''Santa Maria dello Stellario''' (or Church of Stellario)  was a [[catholic]] Church  located in piazza Ciullo, in the town centre of [[Alcamo]], in  the [[province of Trapani]].
==History==  
It was founded in the 17th century by [[Mariano da Alcamo]], a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin| Capuchin]] friar, and consecrated in 1625. As the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] affirms in his work, they carried the [[Holy Sacrament]] and the painting of ''Maria Santissima dello Stellario'' in procession to this Church,  to ask her intercession for rain to come. It had not rained for several months: it rained  continuously for three consecutive days.&lt;ref name=Messi&gt;Messina, Salvatore (2015). Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell'arte. Alcamo: Campo.&lt;/ref&gt;
The founder also created the homonimous [[confraternity]] in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Bembina, G.B. (1956). Alcamo sacra; con note di P. M. Rocca, rivedute ed accresciute da Francesco Maria Mirabella. Alcamo: Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, before being demolished,  the Church was not in bad conditions: in fact, in 1939  Maria De Blasi Casale, a widow,  had financed the restoration of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;"La Chiesa dello Stellario ad Alcamo. Uno scempio impunito"&lt;/ref&gt;
===Description===
The [[façade]] had a fine portal; the Church had a single [[nave]], there were [[Ionic capitals]] and two altars on both sides. On the high altar there was a painting of the titular saint, later missing, realized by  Giuseppe La Ficara in 1651.&lt;ref name=Cata&gt;Cataldo, Carlo (2001). La conchiglia di S.Giacomo. Alcamo: Campo&lt;/ref&gt;The picture, with a low artistic value, represented [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] on a throne of clouds, in the middle of 12 stars and the [[Infant Jesus]] in her arms; there were a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and a capuchin friar on the sides, while the Eternal father and the Holy Ghost were portrayed in the upper part.&lt;ref name=Messi/&gt;

In 1769 the Church was embellished with [[Stucco|stuccoes]];  inside it there were also some ancient crypts which were destroyed during the demolition, made after the building had been sold by the [[Curia (Catholic Church)|Curia]] of Trapani. With the income they bought a piece of land in viale Europa, in order to provide that area with a [[parish Church]], later called [[Church of the Holy Heart (Alcamo)|chiesa del Sacro Cuore]].

===The confraternity of Santa Maria dello Stellario===
It was founded on 21 June 1602 in the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]] and had its oratory inside this Church. From the information that the historian Ignazio De Blasi handed down, we know that its brethren were butchers and farmers.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt; They wore a sack and a visor made with linen cloth,  a fabric mantle with the image of  Maria Santissima dello Stellario, and a big cordon; they went barefoot, with sandals like capuchin friars,  the order which their founder, Father [[Mariano da Alcamo|Mariano Bonofino]],  belonged to.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;
The confraternity dissolved  in the forties.
====Duties of the brethren====  
Here it is the list of their obligations:  
*Being always very diligent, in any occasion 
*Taking part in the [[sung Mass]] and receive Communion on 8th September, festivity of their titular Saint.
*Taking part in the procession of [[Corpus Domini]] and on its [[Octave (liturgy)|Octave]]
*Accompanying dead brethren to their sepulchre and complying with the Easter Precept on [[Maundy Thursday]], in the Church of the Capuchin friars.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;

'''''Grow Your Own''''' is a 2007 British [[comedy film]] directed by [[Richard Laxton]], and written by [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] and [[Carl Hunter]]. It stars [[Benedict Wong]], [[John Henshaw]], [[Eddie Marsan]], Pierce Quigley, [[Omid Djalili]], Alan Williams, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]], and [[Olivia Colman]]. The film centres on a group of gardeners at a Merseyside allotment, who react angrily when a group of refugees are given plots at the site, but after they get to know them better, soon change their minds. The film was previously known under the title ''The Allotment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809763394/details|title=The Allotment (2006)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The original idea for the film came from Carl Hunter's involvement with the [[Merseyside]] community group "Art in Action". With the project he had worked with a number of refugees who had taken up residence in [[Liverpool]]. The refugees were each given an allotment as part of a [[Liverpool City Council]] initiative. This led Hunter to produce a series of documentaries about the lives of the refugees entitled ''Putting Down Roots'', they were broadcast as part of the "3-minute wonder" slot on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=northwest/&gt; Frank Cottrell Boyce saw some potential in the concept and asked Hunter if he wished to work with him to turn the real-life story into a film. The film was supported by North West Vision, [[BBC Films]] and the [[UK Film Council]].&lt;ref name=northwest/&gt; 
Shooting for the film began on 14 August 2006, taking place for six weeks.&lt;ref name=northwest/&gt; All filming took place in [[Merseyside]], with the shoot providing numerous jobs for locals.&lt;ref name=northwest/&gt;

==Reception==
Leigh Singer gave the film four stars, calling it "a gentle, astute, life-affirming British comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=161840&amp;page=2|title=Grow Your Own|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Channel 4|author=Leigh Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Hawker gave it three stars, praising Eddie Marsan's performance and stating "''Grow Your Own'' has about as much edge as a prize melon, but even if the land's been well filled, there's still plenty of fertile soil here. Occasionally melancholy, often funny, this is touching, lyrical home-grown fare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/cinema_reviews/films_out_this_week/grow_your_own|title=Grow Your Own - Film Review|accessdate=2007-06-16|author=Tom Hawker|publisher=Total Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Maher gave three stars, noting his favourite part of the film as being "a serious discussion between the gardeners about ''[[Bob the Builder]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article1927084.ece|title=Grow your Own|accessdate=2007-06-16|date=2007-06-14|publisher=Times Online|author=Kevin Maher | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Quinn of ''[[The Independent]]'' criticised the film citing "one could wish that this parable of difference and tolerance gladdened the heart, but its effortful comedy has quite the opposite effect", as well as expressing his distaste for the film's score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/film/reviews/article2660506.ece|title=Grow Your Own (PG)|accessdate=2007-06-16|date=2007-06-15|publisher=The Independent|author=Anthony Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Chambers also disliked it, stating "''Grow Your Own'''s twee optimism is sometimes a little too much to digest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/06/11/grow_your_own_2007_review.shtml|title=Grow Your Own (2007)|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=BBC|author=Cathrine Chambers|date=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of Asian art''' or '''Eastern art''', includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions. Developments in Asian art historically parallel those in [[Western art]], in general a few centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art'', Revised and Expanded edition (Hardcover) by [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]],&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese art]], [[Indian art]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EED91E3CF933A25754C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2] NY Times, Holland Cotter, accessed online October 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean art]], [[Japanese art]],&lt;ref&gt;Japonisme: The Japanese Influence on Western Art Since 1858 (Paperback)

[[Near Eastern]] art also had a significant influence on Western art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/ancient-near-eastern-art Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ancient Near Eastern Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding [[prehistoric art]], the [[art of Mesopotamia]] represents the oldest forms of Asian art.

'''Buddhist art''' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world. Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].

A common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]]. From a viewer's perspective, it represents schematically the ideal universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blume|first1=Nancy|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://asiasociety.org/exploring-mandala|website=Asia Society|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Cristian|title=Mandala|url=https://www.ancient.eu/mandala/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction. Its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] saw the mandala as ''"a representation of the center of the unconscious self,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm Carl Jung and the Mandala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024061549/http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }} Retrieved January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.&lt;ref&gt;See C G Jung: ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp.186–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutanese art==
{{Main article|Bhutanese art}}
[[File:Bhutanese thanka of Mt. Meru and the Buddhist Universe.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhutanese [[thanka]] of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt. Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]

'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive “spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the ‘[[Folk Heritage Museum]]’ in Thimphu. There is also a ‘Voluntary Artists Studio’ in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=June 7, 2010|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian art==

{{Main article|Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture}}
'''Cambodian art''' and the culture of [[Cambodia]] has had a rich and varied history dating back many centuries and has been heavily influenced by [[India]]. In turn, Cambodia greatly influenced [[Thailand]], Laos and vice versa. Throughout Cambodia's long history, a major source of inspiration was from religion. Throughout nearly two millennium, a Cambodians developed a unique [[Khmer people|Khmer]] belief from the syncreticism of indigenous [[animistic]] beliefs and the Indian religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Indian culture and civilization, including its language and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century CE. It is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the gulf of Thailand and the Pacific while trading with China. The first state to benefit from this was [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]. At various times, Cambodia culture also absorbed elements from [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] cultures.

[[File:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|thumb|left|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Cambodia|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE]]

The history of [[Visual arts of Cambodia]] stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the [[Angkor]] period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Pottery|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.

By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power. The artists who sculpted the stones doubtless satisfied the primary objectives and requisites demanded by the persons who commissioned them. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeed in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

==Chinese art==
{{Main article|Chinese art|Chinese painting|Chinese ceramics|Chinese jade|Chinese calligraphy}}
'''Chinese art''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) has varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology. Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (詞) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (趙孟頫) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].

{{Main article|Indian art|Indian painting|Rangoli}}
'''Indian art''' can be classified into specific periods, each reflecting certain religious, political and cultural developments. The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&amp;nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. 

The art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].

The contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. 

During the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].

One of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.

The visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Insight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.

Specific periods: 	

*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] – present)
 	
*Islamic ascendancy (712–1757 [[Common Era|CE]])

*The colonial period (1757–1947)

*Modern and Postmodern art in India 

*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)

'''Indonesian art''' and culture has been shaped by long [[interaction]] between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. [[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.

[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]
Other exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.

Indonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.

[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760–830&amp;nbsp;AD]]
Most notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.

Calligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.

===Balinese art===
{{Main article|Balinese art}}
[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]
'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings. Covarrubias&lt;ref name="Covarubias"&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes Balinese art as, "... a highly developed, although informal Baroque folk art that combines the peasant liveliness with the refinement of classicism of Hinduistic Java, but free of the conservative prejudice and with a new vitality fired by the exuberance of the demonic spirit of the tropical primitive". Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''&lt;ref name="Eiseman"&gt;

In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.

This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.&lt;ref name="Geertz-Images_of_Power"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.

==Japanese art==

[[File:Birds and flowers of the four seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=3|left|Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground.]]

'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.

The art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''
[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.

The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC – 300&amp;nbsp;AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300–700&amp;nbsp;AD).

Ancient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal—especially [[bronze]]—and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture – except for miniaturized works – had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.

''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning "floating world", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term "Sorrowful World" (憂き世), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.

==Korean art==
[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (금강전도, 金剛全圖), Korea, c.1734]]

{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}
'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.

While there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.

The study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]’s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea’s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''

Generally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].

'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated "While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laotian art==
{{Main article|Lao art}}
[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]
'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].

Lao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.

==Nepalese art==
{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}
The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

==Thai art==
{{Main article|Thai art}}
[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]
'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.

The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; 
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;
*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;
*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;
*[[human head|head]] like an egg;
*Hair like scorpion stingers;
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.

==Tibetan art==
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]
{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}

'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].

As [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.

Tibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]
A visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.

Historians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.
[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tô Ngọc Vân, ''Thiếu nữ bên hoa huệ (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]
[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.



The Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.

The [[Nguyễn dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802–1945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn dynasty.

Beginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History – A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt;

Modern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.

===Vietnamese calligraphy===
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Quốc Ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.

[[File:Filipino Painting 12.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[José Honorato Lozano]] painting of Calle Sebastian, Quiapo, Manila in the mid-1800s with its iconic [[Bahay na bato]] architectures. The painting style strongly indicates a melting pot of east and west that resulted to its own originality.]]
[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[José Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.
[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]
Kutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art.

At the end of July 2007 the monument was dismantled under the pretext of reconstruction of the architectural ensemble of the square before the Legislative Assembly. However, the restored monument to the city authorities moved on the forecourt, in front of the Legislative Assembly and a monument to Catherine II. Moving the monument prompted an outcry from the townspeople: according to law enforcement agencies, the Communists and other patriotic organizations organized picket lines several times in front of the Legislative Assembly demanding the return of the monument to its place.
** The oldest statue of Lenin in Krasnodar (sculptor K. Dietrich) is in the park to VI Lenin, on the street Vishnyakova. The monument was built in 1925, a year after the death of the Soviet leader.

In the modern [[Gaelic languages]], '''''Lochlann'''''&amp;nbsp;{{Pronunciation-needed}} signifies [[Scandinavia]] or, more specifically, [[Norway]]. As such it is [[cognate]] with the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for Scandinavia, '''Llychlyn'''. In both old Gaelic and old Welsh, such names literally mean "land of lakes" or "land of swamps".

[[Classical Gaelic]] literature and other sources from [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|early medieval Ireland]] first featured the name, in earlier forms like '''Laithlind''' and ''' Lothlend'''.  In [[Irish Language|Irish]], the adjectival noun ''Lochlannach'' ("person belonging to Lochlann") has an additional sense of "raider" or, more specifically, a [[viking]].

==Historical uses==
All uses of the word "Lochlann" relate it to Nordic realms of Europe.  While the traditional view has identified Laithlind with [[Norway]], some have preferred to locate it in a Norse-dominated part of [[Scotland]], perhaps the [[Hebrides]] or the [[Northern Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (2007) pp. 107–108 &amp; 286–289&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donnchadh Ó Corráin]] states that Laithlinn was the name of [[Viking Scotland]], and that a substantial part of Scotland—the Northern and [[Western Isles]] and large areas of the coastal mainland from [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]] to [[Argyll]]—was conquered by the [[Viking expansion|Vikings]] in the first quarter of the ninth century and a Viking kingdom was set up there earlier than the middle of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) various pages.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ireland and the ''Suðreyjar''===
[[File:Ardnamurchan sword, by Pieta Greaves.jpg|thumb|An x-ray image of the sword found at the [[Port an Eilean Mhòir ship burial]].]]
The ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' contain numerous reference to the "Lochlanns", who are clearly Vikings and feared and distrusted by the writers. However relatively few named individuals are identified from amongst their number and their relationships with one another are largely obscure.

[[Tomrair|Jarl Tomrair]], described as the "tanist of the king of Lochlann" fell in the Battle of Sciath Nechtain (near modern [[Castledermot]]) in 848.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'' AU 848.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 851 Zain, also identified as the "half-king of the Lochlanns"&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and Iargna "the two chiefs of the fleet of the Lochlanns" are recorded as fighting against the Danes in [[Carlingford Lough]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The same source notes that in the sixth year of the reign of [[Máel Sechnaill mac Maíl Ruanaid|Maelsechlainn]], circa 852 [[Amlaíb Conung|Amlaíb]] "the son of the King of Lochlann, came to Erin, and he brought with him commands from his father for many rents and tributes, but he left suddenly. Imhar, his younger brother, came after him to levy the same rents."&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 125–27&lt;/ref&gt; Amlaíb is also called the "son of the king of Laithlind" by the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' in 853.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Ulster'' AU 853.2&lt;/ref&gt; While certainly of Scandinavian origin – Amlaíb is the [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] representation of the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] name ''Oláfr'' – the question of Amlaíb's immediate origins is debated. In 871 he "went from Erin to Lochlann to wage war on the Lochlanns" to assist his father [[Gofraid of Lochlainn|Goffridh]] who had "come for him".&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OC34&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Hona, who the annalists believed was a [[druid]] and Tomrir Torra were "two noble chiefs",  "of great fame among their own people", and "of the best race of the Lochlanns", although their careers appear to have been otherwise unrecorded. They died whilst fighting the men of [[Munster]] in 860.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 145–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Gnimbeolu, chief of the Galls of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], was killed in 865, possibly the same person as Gnim Cinnsiolla, chief of the Lochlanns who is recorded as dying in similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; In 869 Tomrark the Earl is described as a "fierce, rough, cruel man of the Lochlanns"&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and the annalist notes, perhaps with some satisfaction, that this "enemy of [[Brendan|Brenann]]" died of madness at Port-Mannan (possibly the harbour of the [[Isle of Man]]) in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kong-magnus-berrfott-menn.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|19th-century depiction of Magnus Barefoot's forces in Ireland.]]
Also in 869 the [[Pict]]s were attacked by the Lochlanns and internal strife in Lochlann was recorded because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the sons of Albdan, King of Lochlann, expelled the eldest son, Raghnall, son of Albdan, because they feared that he would take the kingdom of Lochlann after their father; and Raghnall came with his three sons to [[Orkney|Innsi Orc]] and Raghnall tarried there with his youngest son. But his elder sons, with a great host, which they collected from every quarter, came on to the British Isles, being elated with pride and ambition, to attack the Franks and Saxons. They thought that their father had returned to Lochlann immediately after setting out.&lt;ref name=OD158&gt;O'Donovan (1860) pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This entry provides a number of problems. The demise of Gofraid, King of Lochlann and father of Amlaíb and Imhar (or Ímar) and [[Auisle]]&lt;ref name=D171&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; seems to be recorded in the ''Fragmentary Annals'' in 873:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ég righ Lochlainne .i. Gothfraid do tedmaimm grána opond. Sic quod placuit Deo''. (The death of the king of Lochlainn i.e. Gothfraid of a sudden and horrible fit. So it pleased God.)&lt;ref name=OC36&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; O' Corrain (1998) concludes that: "this much-emended entry appears to be the death notice of Gøðrøðr, king of the Vikings in Scotland"&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin (1998) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and although other interpreters believed this entry referred to the death of his son Ímar it is clearly about one of the other.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1867) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Who then is "Albdan"? The name is probably a corruption of the Norse Halden, or Halfdane,&lt;ref name=OD158/&gt; and this may be a reference to [[Halfdan the Black]]. This would make Raghnall [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]] of More in Norway and the brother of [[Harald Finehair]] (although the Norse sagas claim that Halfdan was Raghnall/Rognvald's grandfather).&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lochlanns" may thus have been a generic description for both Norwegian-based warriors and insular forces of Norse descent based in the [[Northern Isles|Norðreyjar]] or [[Hebrides|Suðreyjar]].

Other Lochlannachs mentioned in the texts for dates during the early 10th century are [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Hingamund]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; (or Ingimund) and Otter, son of Iargna, who was killed by the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan (1860) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the meaning of Laithlind and Lochlann in Ireland in the ninth and tenth centuries, it may have referred to [[Norway]] later.  In 1058 [[Magnus II of Norway|Magnus Haraldsson]] is called "the son of the king of Lochlann", and his nephew [[Magnus Barefoot]] is the "king of Lochlann" in the Irish πreports of the great western expedition four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'', s.a. 1058, s.a 1102; Woolf (2007) pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
The Irish Lochlann has a cognate in the [[Welsh language]] ''Llychlyn'', which appears as a name for Scandinavia in the prose tales ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' and ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'', and in some versions of [[Welsh Triad]] 35.&lt;ref name="Bromwich88"&gt;Bromwich, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In these versions of Triad 35 ''Llychlyn'' is the destination of the otherwise unattested Yrp of the Hosts, who depleted Britain's armies by demanding that each of the island's chief fortresses provide him with twice the men he brought; though he began with only two men he left with many thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; The same versions also give Llychlyn as the destination of the army led by [[Elen (saint)|Elen of the Hosts]] and [[Maxen Wledig]], the Welsh version of the historical Roman usurper [[Magnus Maximus]]. However, [[Rachel Bromwich]] suggests that ''Llychlyn'' in this case might be a corruption of ''Llydaw'', or [[Armorica]], Maxen's usual destination in other sources.&lt;ref name="Bromwich88"/&gt; In ''The Dream of Rhonabwy'', a company from Llychlyn led by [[Mark of Cornwall|March ap Meirchiawn]] (the King Mark of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend) appears among Arthur's vividly-depicted host.&lt;ref name="Bromwich435"&gt;Bromwich, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Bromwich suggests this appearance derives ultimately from a recollection of Welsh Triad 14, which depicts March ap Meirchiawn as one of the "Three Seafarers/Fleet Owners of the Island of Britain" – the Scandinavians being famed for their nautical skills.&lt;ref name="Bromwich435"/&gt;

==Literary uses==
Lochlann is the land of the [[Fomorians]] in the Irish ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]''.  In the ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'' and the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'' the "huge and ugly" Fomorians are pirates who inhabit the [[Outer Hebrides]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1926) pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scandinavian Lochlann appears in later Irish tales, generally concerning the King of Lochlann—sometimes called Colgán—or his sons, such as in the tales of [[Lugh]] and the [[Fenian Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, James, ''Oxford Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', s.v. "Llychlyn" &amp; "Lochlainn". Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-860967-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lebor Bretnach]]'' – a Gaelic adaption of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' perhaps compiled at [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]]—makes [[Hengist]]'s daughter "the fairest of the women of all Lochlann". Hengist was a legendary [[Anglo-Saxon]] leader of the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is an addition to the ''Lebor Bretnach'' and thus cannot be compared to the original ''Historia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition "Prince Breacan of Lochlann" was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships.&lt;ref name=HS51&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS61&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHM71&gt;Murray (1966) pp. 71–2&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The adventures of Prince Breacan of Lochlann are part of the mythology of the naming of the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] ({{Lang-gd|Coire Bhreacain}}), a whirlpool between the islands of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]] on the west coast of [[Scotland]]. The story goes that the tidal race was named after this Norse Prince "said to be son to the King of Denmark" who was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships. Breacan is reputed to be buried in a cave at ''Bagh nam Muc'' (bay of the swine) at the north-western tip of Jura.&lt;ref name=HS51/&gt;&lt;ref name=HS61/&gt; According to Haswell-Smith (2004) [[Adomnan]]'s ''Life of St Columba'' suggests this calamity occurred between Rathlin Island and the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] coast.&lt;ref name=HS51/&gt; [[W.H. Murray]] corroborates the view that the original story may have referred to this latter location, quoting the 10th century ''Glossary'' of Cormac who describes the tale of "Brecan, son of Maine, son of Nial Naoighhiallach".&lt;ref name=WHM71/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Martin|Martin, Martin]] (1703) "[http://www.appins.org/martin.htm A Voyage to St. Kilda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}" in ''A Description of The Western Islands of Scotland'', Appin Regiment/Appin Historical Society. Retrieved 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same story is associated with the ''Bealach a' Choin Ghlais'' (pass of the grey dog), a tidal race further north between Scarba and [[Lunga, Firth of Lorn|Lunga]]. The prince's dog managed to swim to land and went in search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits in the middle of the channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Mike [http://www.ukseakayakguidebook.co.uk/jura_easter_04/art_jura_easter_2004.htm "Jura &amp; the Corryvreckan ~ tales and legends from an Easter Expedition in 2004"] ukseakayakguidebook.co.uk Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moneygami''' (also known as '''money-gami''')&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; is a term that arose as a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[money]] and [[origami]]. It refers to shaping [[paper currency]], such as [[India]]n [[Indian rupee|rupees]] and [[United States]] [[United States dollar|dollars]], into pieces of art. The concept has been popularized by individuals such as Japanese [[pop art]]ist Yosuke Hasegawa, who has had his work featured at an exhibition at the [[Tadu Art Gallery]], and its creation can function as [[Culture|cultural]] commentary on the value that [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] societies place on money. For example, one piece by Hasegawa involves Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s folded head wearing a [[cowboy hat]] in a double image, based on [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Triple Elvis|famous picture of]] [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/sunday/Money-changes-everything-30265660.html|title=Money changes everything|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=2 August 2015|publisher= [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |first=Khetsirin|last=Pholdhampalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name alludes to traditional origami, which is the [[Japanese art]] of folding flat materials, generally paper, into figures resembling various objects. Other examples of moneygami include folding bills into clothing-like bits, such as dollar bills becoming [[bowties]].&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2014/01/16/Carnegie-boy-teachs-origami/stories/201401160059|title=Carnegie boy, 12, teaches origami|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|accessdate=25 September 2015|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Montini Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala Montini'') is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Cima da Conegliano]], dating from around  1506-1507 and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

The work adopts the same scheme of several altarpieces by [[Giovanni Bellini]], such as the ''[[San Giobbe Altarpiece]]''. It was originally executed for the [[Parma Cathedral]].

It shows the Virgin Mary on a high throne in a mosaic-decorated [[apse]], while offering a hand towards the bowing [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/illustration/pala-montini-by-giovanni-battista-cima-da-conegliano-known-graphisme/132701818?Language=fr Fondation Getty]&lt;/ref&gt; A bearded Saint [[John the Baptist]], in a sleeveless vest, is portrayed on the left. On the right, the Christ Child is blessing [[Saint Apollonia]] (whose attribute of the pincer with tooth is in the plinth before her), Saint Catherine of Alexandria (with her attribute, the broken wheel), and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (with a book). An angel sits at the foot of the throne in the centre foreground and holds a stringed musical instrument.

'''Motion graphic design''' is a subset of [[graphic design]] in that it uses graphic design principles in a [[filmmaking]] or [[video production]] context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of [[animation]] or [[Film techniques|filmic techniques]]. Examples include the [[kinetic typography]] and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional [[station identification]] logos of some [[television channel]]s. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.

A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from [[film]]making or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. 

Popular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.

==Technology==
Technological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as [[computer program]]s for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.

One of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been [[Adobe After Effects]], which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is [[Apple Inc.]] [[Motion (software)|Motion]], now a part of [[Final Cut Studio]]. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.

[[Adobe Flash]] has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in [[web design]], but also in some animation products, such as animated [[web television]] productions like [[Homestar Runner]].

'''''My Life in Court''''' is a 1961 memoir by American trial lawyer [[Louis Nizer]] documenting his career in law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/obituaries/louis-nizer-lawyer-to-the-famous-dies-at-92.html|title=Louis Nizer, Lawyer to the Famous, Dies at 92|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=November 11, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was a best seller when it was first released, lasting for 72 weeks on ''The New York Times'' Bestsellers list.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book is based on a number of court cases that Nizer argued in US courts. The original papers for many of these trials are held by the Columbia Law Library.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1940-1949/Pages/baronfeist.html|title=Music Copyright Infringement Resource – Sponsored By USC Gould School of Law|website=mcir.usc.edu|access-date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite archive|collection=Louis Nizer Papers, 1940–1994|institution=Columbia Librarias Rare Book and Manuscript Library Collections|box=[http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-rb/ldpd_10203548/dsc/3/ Biographical Materials &amp; My Life in Court]|Series=Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book was received favorably. ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not "understand why it has become a bestseller", but all in all "Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man.  Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/my-life-in-court-by-louis-nizer/|title=My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer|last=Bazelon|first=David T.|date=July 1, 1962|website=Commentary Magazine|publisher=|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bazelon challenges praise by [[Max Lerner]] that the work is "one of the great legal autobiographies of our time".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book "direct and orderly" and enjoyable by "Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In ''The Modern Law Review,'' British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented "I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C.

Unlike other academic reviewers, ''American Bar Association Journal'' reviewer [[Alfred Schweppe]] praised the book as a "''must'' for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom" and the describing the style as "Moving with an easy finished prose".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

{{About|the painting by Edward Hopper}}
{{Infobox artwork/wikidata}}

'''''Nighthawks''''' is a 1942 oil on canvas painting by [[Edward Hopper]] that portrays people in a downtown [[diner]] late at night.

It has been described as Hopper's best known work&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers and Harold Osborne (Eds.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1997 (second edition), p. 273, {{ISBN|0-19-860084-4}} "The central theme of his work is the loneliness of city life, generally expressed through one or two figures in a spare setting - his best-known work, Nighthawks, has an unusually large 'cast' with four."&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most recognizable paintings in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/hoppers-nighthawks.html Hopper's Nighthawks], [[Smarthistory]] video, accessed April 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/22/edward-hopper-birthday_n_1692024.html | title=Happy Birthday, Edward Hopper! | publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | work=The Huffington Post | date=July 22, 2012 | accessdate=May 5, 2013 | author=Brooks, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within months of its completion, it was sold to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] on May 13, 1942 for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;The sale was recorded by Josephine Hopper as follows, in volume II, p. 95 of her and Edward's journal of his art: "May 13, '42: Chicago Art Institute - 3,000 + return of Compartment C in exchange as part payment. 1,000 - 1/3 = 2,000." See Deborah Lyons, ''Edward Hopper: A Journal of His Work.'' New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the painting==

===Josephine Hopper's notes on the painting===
Starting shortly after their marriage in 1924, Edward Hopper and his wife Josephine (Jo) kept a journal in which he would, using a pencil, make a sketch-drawing of each of his paintings, along with a precise description of certain technical details. Jo Hopper would then add additional information about the theme of the painting.

A review of the page on which ''Nighthawks'' is entered shows (in Edward Hopper's handwriting) that the intended name of the work was actually '''''Night Hawks''''' and that the painting was completed on January 21, 1942.

Jo's handwritten notes about the painting give considerably more detail, including the possibility that the painting's title may have had its origins as a reference to the beak-shaped nose of the man at the bar, or that the appearance of one of the "nighthawks" was tweaked in order to relate to the original meaning of the word:

{{quote|Night + brilliant interior of cheap restaurant. Bright items: cherry wood counter + tops of surrounding stools; light on metal tanks at rear right; brilliant streak of jade green tiles 3/4 across canvas--at base of glass of window curving at corner. Light walls, dull yellow ocre [sic] door into kitchen right.

Very good looking blond boy in white (coat, cap) inside counter. Girl in red blouse, brown hair eating sandwich. Man night hawk (beak) in dark suit, steel grey hat, black band, blue shirt (clean) holding cigarette. Other figure dark sinister back--at left. Light side walk outside pale greenish. Darkish red brick houses opposite. Sign across top of restaurant, dark--Phillies 5c cigar. Picture of cigar. Outside of shop dark, green. Note: bit of bright ceiling inside shop against dark of outside street--at edge of stretch of top of window.&lt;ref&gt;See Deborah Lyons, Edward Hopper: A Journal of His Work. New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1997, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1942, Jo confirmed her preference for the name. In a letter to Edward's sister Marion she wrote, "Ed has just finished a very fine picture--a lunch counter at night with 3 figures. Night Hawks would be a fine name for it. E. posed for the two men in a mirror and I for the girl. He was about a month and half working on it."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Hopper, letter to Marion Hopper, January 22, 1942. Quoted in Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, 2007, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership history==
[[File:Nighthawks invoice Ed Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|Invoice showing $1,971 going to the artist after commission and costs]]

Upon completing the canvas in the late winter of 1942, Hopper placed it on display at Rehn's, the gallery at which his paintings were normally placed for sale. It remained there for about a month. On St. Patrick's Day, Edward and Jo Hopper attended the opening of an exhibit of the paintings of [[Henri Rousseau]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], which had been organized by Daniel Catton Rich, the director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Rich was in attendance, along with [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred Barr]], the director of the Museum of Modern Art. Barr spoke enthusiastically of ''[[Gas (painting)|Gas]]'', which Hopper had painted a year earlier, and "Jo told him he just had to go to Rehn's to see ''Nighthawks''. In the event it was Rich who went, pronounced ''Nighthawks'' 'fine as a [[Winslow Homer|Homer]]', and soon arranged its purchase for Chicago."&lt;ref&gt;Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, 2007, pp. 351-2, citing Jo Hopper's diary entry for March 17, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale price was $3,000. The painting has remained in the collection of the Art Institute ever since.

==Location of the restaurant==
The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper himself said the painting "was suggested by a restaurant on [[Greenwich Avenue]] where two streets meet." Additionally, he noted that "I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger."&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, interview with [[Katharine Kuh]], in ''The Artist's Voice: Talks with Seventeen Modern Artists''. 1962. Reprinted, New York: Da Capo Press, 2000, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

This reference has led Hopper aficionados to engage in a search for the location of the original diner. The inspiration for this search has been summed up on the blog of one of these searchers: "I am finding it extremely difficult to let go of the notion that the Nighthawks diner was a real diner, and not a total composite built of grocery stores, hamburger joints, and bakeries all cobbled together in the painter's imagination."&lt;ref name="Moss 1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeremiah Moss |url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/06/finding-nighthawks-coda.html |title=Jeremiah's Vanishing New York: Finding Nighthawks, Coda |work=[[Jeremiah's Vanishing New York]] |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot usually associated with the former location is a now-vacant lot known as [[Mulry Square]] at the intersection of Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Avenue and West 11th Street, about seven blocks west of Hopper's studio on Washington Square. However, according to an article by Jeremiah Moss in ''[[The New York Times]]'', this cannot be the location of the diner that inspired the painting as a gas station occupied that lot from the 1930s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Moss 2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Jeremiah |title=Nighthawks State of Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/opinion/05moss.html?_r=1&amp;hp |work=The New York Times |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss located a land-use map in a 1950s municipal atlas showing that "Sometime between the late '30s and early '50s, a new diner appeared near Mulry Square." Specifically, the diner was located immediately to the right of the gas station, "not in the empty northern lot, but on the southwest side, where Perry Street slants." This map is not reproduced in the ''Times'' article but is shown on Moss's blog.&lt;ref name="Moss blog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moss |first=Jeremiah |title=Finding Nighthawks, Part 3 |url=http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2010/06/finding-nighthawks-part-3.html |work=Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (blog) |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss comes to the conclusion that Hopper should be taken at his word: the painting was merely "suggested" by a real-life restaurant, he had "simplified the scene a great deal," and he "made the restaurant bigger." In short, there probably never was a single real-life scene identical to the one that Hopper had created, and if one did exist, there is no longer sufficient evidence to pin down the precise location. Moss concludes, "the ultimate truth remains bitterly out of reach."&lt;ref name="Moss 1"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Roger Brown - Puerto Rican Wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]]'s ''Puerto Rican Wedding'' (1969). Brown said that the café in the lower left corner of this painting "isn't set up like an imitation of ''Nighthawks'', but still refers to it very much."&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{in popular culture|date=November 2018}}

Because it is so widely recognized, the diner scene in ''Nighthawks'' has served as the model for many homages and parodies.

===Painting and sculpture===
Many artists have produced works that allude or respond to ''Nighthawks''.

Hopper influenced the [[Photorealism|Photorealists]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including [[Ralph Goings]], who evoked ''Nighthawks'' in several paintings of diners. [[Richard Estes]] painted a corner store in ''People's Flowers'' (1971), but in daylight, with the shop's large window reflecting the street and sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Levin | first=Gail | contribution=Edward Hopper: His Legacy for Artists | year=1995 | editor-last=Lyons | editor-first=Deborah | editor2-last=Weinberg | editor2-first=Adam D. | title=Edward Hopper and the American Imagination | publisher=W. W. Norton | place=New York | isbn=0-393-31329-8 | pages=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More direct visual quotations began to appear in the 1970s. [[Gottfried Helnwein]]'s painting ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'' (1984) replaces the three patrons with American pop culture icons [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[James Dean]], and the attendant with [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3799.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704114730/http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3799.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 4, 2009 |title=Boulevard of Broken Dreams II |publisher=Helnwein.com |date=October 15, 2013 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hopper scholar Gail Levin, Helnwein connected the bleak mood of ''Nighthawks'' with 1950s American cinema and with "the tragic fate of the decade's best-loved celebrities."&lt;ref name="Levin, 109–110"&gt;Levin, 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nighthawks Revisited'', a 1980 parody by [[Red Grooms]], clutters the street scene with pedestrians, cats, and trash.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 116–123.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 [[Banksy]] parody shows a fat, shirtless [[soccer hooligan]] in [[Union Flag]] boxers standing inebriated outside the diner, apparently having just smashed the diner window with a nearby chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Jury | first=Louise | title=Rats to the Arts Establishment | newspaper=The Independent | date=October 14, 2005 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rats-to-the-arts-establishment-319534.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Several writers have explored how the customers in ''Nighthawks'' came to be in a diner at night, or what will happen next. [[Wolf Wondratschek]]'s poem "Nighthawks: After Edward Hopper's Painting" imagines the man and woman sitting together in the diner as an estranged couple: "I bet she wrote him a letter/ Whatever it said, he's no longer the man / Who'd read her letters twice."&lt;ref&gt;Gemünden, 2–5, 15; quotation translated from the German by Gemünden.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote interior monologues for the figures in the painting in her poem "Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, 1942".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Updike |first= John |chapter= Hopper's Polluted Silence |title= Still Looking: Essays on American Art |publisher= Knopf |place= New York |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-4000-4418-9 |page= 181}}. The Oates poem appears in the anthology {{Citation | editor-last = Hirsch | editor-first = Edward | editor-link = Edward Hirsch | title = Transforming Vision: Writers on Art | place = Chicago, Illinois | publisher = Art Institute of Chicago | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8212-2126-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special issue of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' included five brief dramatizations that built five different plots around the painting; one, by screenwriter Christof Schlingensief, turned the scene into a chainsaw massacre.  [[Erik Jendresen]] and [[Stuart Dybek]] also wrote short stories inspired by this painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gemünden, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://christinajaniczek.com/review.html|title= Book Review: Coast of Chicago by Stuart Dybek|last1=Janiczek|first1=Christina|date=December 5, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Hopper was an avid moviegoer and critics have noted the resemblance of his paintings to [[film still]]s. ''Nighthawks'' and works such as ''Night Shadows'' (1921) anticipate the look of [[film noir]], whose development Hopper may have influenced.&lt;ref name="Gemunden"&gt;{{Citation | last=Gemünden | first=Gerd | title=Framed Vsions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination | publisher=University of Michigan Press | place=Ann Arbor | year=1998 | isbn=0-472-10947-2 | pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doss"&gt;{{Citation|last=Doss |first=Erika |title=Edward Hopper, Nighthawks, and Film Noir |journal=Post Script: Essays in Film and the Humanities |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=14–36 |year=1983 |format=PDF |url=http://www.colorado.edu/finearts/erikadoss/articles/postscriptessay.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016091540/http://www.colorado.edu/finearts/erikadoss/articles/postscriptessay.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hopper was an acknowledged influence on the film musical ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' (1981), for which production designer Ken Adam recreated ''Nighthawks'' as a set.&lt;ref&gt;Doss, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Wim Wenders]] recreated ''Nighthawks'' as the set for a film-within-a-film in ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Gemunden"/&gt; Wenders suggested that Hopper's paintings appeal to filmmakers because "You can always tell where the camera is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berman |first=Avis |title=Hopper |journal=Smithsonian |url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/july/hopper.php?page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045932/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/july/hopper.php?page=4 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 11, 2007 |volume=38 |issue=4 |page=4 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), two characters visit a café resembling the diner in a scene that illustrates their solitude and despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Arouet | first=Carole | title=Glengarry Glen Ross ou l’autopsie de l’image modèle de l’économie américaine | journal=La Voix du Regard | issue=14 | year=2001 | url=http://www.voixduregard.org/14-Aurouet.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928150036/http://www.voixduregard.org/14-Aurouet.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 28, 2007 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was also briefly used as a background for a scene in the animated film ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' (1973) by director [[Ralph Bakshi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://agentpalmer.com/2367/media/movies/rotospective-ralph-bakshis-heavy-traffic-is-high-on-detail-consistency-and-realism/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nighthawks'' also influenced the "future noir" look of ''[[Blade Runner]]''; director [[Ridley Scott]] said "I was constantly waving a reproduction of this painting under the noses of the production team to illustrate the look and mood I was after".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Sammon, Paul M. | title=Future Noir: the Making of Blade Runner | publisher=HarperPrism | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=0-06-105314-7 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the 1998 film ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] noted that the film had "store windows that owe something to Edward Hopper's ''Nighthawks''."&lt;ref name="Dark City"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebertfest.com/two/dark_city_rev.htm|title=Dark City|work=ebertfest.com|access-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930110156/http://www.ebertfest.com/two/dark_city_rev.htm|archive-date=September 30, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'' (2005) acknowledged a similar debt by setting one scene at a "Nighthawks Diner" where a character purchases a T-shirt with ''Nighthawks'' printed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chambers |first=Bill |contribution=Hard Candy (2006), The King (2006) |title=Film Freak Central |url=http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/hardcandyking.htm |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235810/http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/hardcandyking.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale model===
A number of [[model railroad]]ers, most notably [[John Armstrong (model railroader)|John Armstrong]], have recreated the scene on their layouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=And Now for Something Completely Different|url=http://ogrforum.ogaugerr.com/topic/and-now-for-something-completely-different-1|website=O Gauge Railroading On-Line Forum|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater lighting manufacturer [[Electronic Theatre Controls]] has a human sized scale model of the diner in the lobby of their headquarters in Middleton, Wisconsin. It is used as a reception area for the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.etcconnect.com/tag/nighthawks/ "Secrets of ETC’s Town Square"]. Et Cetera, [[Electronic Theatre Controls]]. Retrieved October 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
Some editions of the [[board game]] ''[[Masterpiece (game)|Masterpiece]]'' contain ''Nighthawks'' as one of the paintings.

===Parodies===
''Nighthawks'' has been widely referenced and parodied in popular culture. Versions of it have appeared on posters, T-shirts and greeting cards as well as in comic books and advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 125–126.  {{Citation &lt;!--news--&gt; | last = Reynolds | first = Christopher | title = Lives of a Diner | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | pages = E25 | date = September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these parodies—like Helnwein's ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'', which became a popular poster&lt;ref name="Levin, 109–110"/&gt;—retain the diner and the highly recognizable diagonal composition but replace the patrons and attendant with other characters: animals, [[Santa Claus]] and his reindeer, or the cast of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' or ''[[Peanuts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 125–126; Thiesen, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One parody of ''Nighthawks'' even inspired a parody of its own. Michael Bedard's painting ''Window Shopping'' (1989), part of his ''[[Sitting Ducks]]'' series of posters, replaces the figures in the diner with ducks and shows a crocodile outside eying the ducks in anticipation. Poverino Peppino parodied this image in ''Boulevard of Broken Ducks'' (1993), in which a contented crocodile lies on the counter while four ducks stand outside in the rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Müller | first1 = Beate |url = | title = Parody: Dimensions and Perspectives | publisher = Rodopi | place = | volume = | edition = | year = 1997 | isbn=904200181X | chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Sirius Radio]] host [[Howard Stern]], featured a parody on his website entitled ''Wack Pack Diner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirius.comwww.howardstern.com/uploads/FanZoneDownloadModel/87/image/broken-dreams-copy.original.jpg|title=The Official Site of Howard Stern - HowardStern.com|work=Howard Stern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015212858/http://www.sirius.comwww.howardstern.com/uploads/FanZoneDownloadModel/87/image/broken-dreams-copy.original.jpg|archivedate=October 15, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleveland Opera==
Cleveland Opera was incorporated by David Bamberger, Carola Bamberger, and John D. Heavenrich in March 1976 and presented its first season in October and November of that year with sold-out productions of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. By 1984, it had become the resident opera company at [[Playhouse Square]], with performances at the [[State Theatre (Cleveland, Ohio)|State Theater]].  The company played an integral part in the revitalization of Cleveland's historic Cleveland Theater District and was a leader in the movement to make theaters accessible to the physically challenged.  There was considerable overlap between the orchestra personnel of the Cleveland Opera, Cleveland Ballet, and the Ohio Chamber Orchestra, to the advantage of all three organizations.

The company was managed from March 1976 to April 2004 by David Bamberger as General Director and Carola Bamberger as Associate Director.  In that period, it presented 122 full productions of 74 works by 43 different composers spanning the history of musical theater from Monteverdi to the present.  Its casts included some of opera's greatest artists, among whom were [[Roberta Peters]], [[Jerome Hines]], [[Sherrill Milnes]], and (in concert) [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and [[José Carreras]].

In addition to operas and operettas, Cleveland Opera presented several [[musical theatre]] favorites, such as ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]].''   It received international attention by commissioning and presenting a world premiere opera by a noted Rock musician, [[Stewart Copeland]] of "[[The Police]]", with his opera ''Holy Blood and Crescent Moon''.  The company was also noted for “Cleveland Opera on Tour,” an extensive education and outreach program.  It was a member of [[OPERA America]],  a national organization which oversees and helps the development of opera across the North American continent.

==Opera Cleveland==
Following the departure of David Bamberger, the company pursued financial policies that weakened it considerably.  The decision was made to merge with another struggling company that operated largely in the summer, Lyric Opera Cleveland. The merged company was named Opera Cleveland and gave its first staged production in April 2007.  Mismanagement plagued the company, however, and it became defunct in the fall of 2010.

==Similar Names==
In subsequent years, two small Cleveland companies changed their names to incorporate the words "Cleveland Opera." In 2014, "Opera per tutti" became "Cleveland Opera Theater" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/musicdance/index.ssf/2014/12/opera_per_tutti_relaunches_wit.html&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2017, "Opera Circle" became "The Cleveland Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.cleveland.com/musicdance/index.ssf/2017/03/opera_circle_cleveland_stakes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Neither institution is connected to the organization described above.

{{Islamic culture}}

An '''oriental rug''' is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in “[[Orient|Oriental countries]]” for home use, local sale, and export.

Oriental carpets can be [[knotted-pile carpet|pile]] woven or [[Kilim|flat woven]] without pile, using various materials such as silk, wool, and cotton. Examples range in size from pillow to large, room-sized carpets, and include carrier bags, floor coverings, decorations for animals, Islamic [[prayer rug]]s (''sajjadah''), Jewish Torah ark covers (''[[parochet]]''), and Christian altar covers. Since the [[High Middle Ages]], oriental rugs have been an integral part of their cultures of origin, as well as of the European and, later on, the North American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|pages=9–10|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, oriental rugs are made in an area referred to as the “Rug Belt”, which stretches from Morocco across North Africa, the Middle East, and into Central Asia and northern India. It includes countries such as northern [[China]], [[Tibet]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], the [[Maghreb]] in the west, the [[Caucasus]] in the north, and [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the south. People from different cultures, countries, racial groups and religious faiths are involved in the production of oriental rugs. Since many of these countries lie in an area which today is referred to as the [[Islamic world]], oriental rugs are often also called “'''Islamic Carpets'''”,&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term “oriental rug” is used mainly for convenience. The carpets from Iran are known as “'''[[Persian Carpets]]'''”.&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origin of the knotted pile rug ==
[[File:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|Border of the [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]], circa 400 BC.]]
The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory about the origin of the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of [[felt]], or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emery|first1=Irene|title=The primary structures of fabrics : an illustrated classification|date=2009|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0500288023|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces [[Soumak rug|soumak]], and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cootner|first1=Cathryn|editor1-last=Cootner|editor1-first=Cathryn|editor1-link=Flat woven textiles|title=Flat-weaves and knotted-pile: An historical and structural overview|date=1981|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A.|isbn=9780874050189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, hand-woven [[pile rug]]s are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wertime|first1=J|title=A new approach to the structural analysis of pile rugs.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=3|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical evidence from ancient sources ===
Probably the oldest existing texts referring to carpets are preserved in [[cuneiform]] writing on [[clay tablet]]s from the royal archives of the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], from the 2nd millennium BC. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for rug is ''mardatu'', and specialist rug weavers referred to as ''kāşiru'' are distinguished from other specialized professions like sack-makers (''sabsu'' or ''sabsinnu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Soden|first1=Wolfram|last2=Schley (transl.)|first2=Donald G.|title=The ancient Orient: an introduction to the study of the ancient Near East|date=1993|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=978-0802801425|page=107|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), I've requested a rug from my lord, and they did not give me (one). [...]" (letter 16 8)
&lt;br&gt;
"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), About the woman who is staying by herself in the palace of Hişamta—The matter does not meet the eye. It would be good if 5 women who weave carpets&lt;ref&gt;lit.: "''mahrĩşa i-pe-şa''", "to do wool work", the interpretation proposed by [[Benno Landsberger]]&lt;/ref&gt; were staying with her." (letter 26 58)

&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Palace inventories from the archives of [[Nuzi]], from the 15th/14th century BC, record 20 large and 20 small ''mardatu'' to cover the chairs of [[Idrimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer-Opificius|first1=Ruth|title=Rekonstruktion des Thrones des Fürsten Idrimi von Alalah = Reconstruction of the throne of Prince Idrimi of Alalah|journal=Ugarit Forschungen|date=1983|volume=15|pages=119–126|url=http://biblio.ebaf.edu/cgi-bin/koha/opac-ISBDdetail.pl?biblionumber=146759|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]] writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a “splendid carpet”. In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X “carpets” are mentioned.

Around 400 BC, the Greek author [[Xenophon]] mentions “carpets” in his book “[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]”:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς" [Xen. anab. VII.3.18]
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''|Xenophon, Anabasis, 400 BC&lt;ref&gt;https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9A%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82/%CE%96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote in ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets (“polymita”) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the texts. Already the earliest known written sources refer to carpets as gifts given to, or required from, high-ranking persons.

=== Pazyryk: The first surviving pile rug ===

The oldest known hand knotted rug which is nearly completely preserved, and can, therefore, be fully evaluated in every technical and design aspect is the [[Pazyryk carpet]], dated to the 5th century BC. It was discovered in the late 1940s by the Russian archeologist Sergei Rudenko and his team.&lt;ref name="Frozen Tombs of Siberia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W. (transl.)|title=Frozen Tombs of Siberia|date=1970|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0460077156|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet was part of the grave gifts preserved frozen in ice in the [[Scythian]] burial mounds of the [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk area]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] of [[Siberia]]&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum: The Pazyryk Carpet"&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/25.+Archaeological+Artifacts/879870/?lng=de The State Hermitage Museum: The Pazyryk Carpet]. Hermitagemuseum.org. Retrieved on 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The provenience of the Pazyryk carpet is under debate, as many carpet weaving countries claim to be its country of origin.&lt;ref name="The debate on the origin of carpets and rugs"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA357 The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art: The debate on the origin of rugs and carpets]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2015-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet had been dyed with plant and insect dyes from the Mongolian steppes.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.212rugcleaners.com/blog/the-history-of-rugs/]&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever it was produced, its fine weaving in symmetric knots and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.

=== Fragments from Turkestan, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan ===
[[File:Textile fragment from Loulan Xinjiang China.jpg|thumb|Carpet fragment, [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], Xinjiang province, China, dated to 3rd-4th century AD. [[British Museum]], London]]
The explorer [[Mark Aurel Stein]] found flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD in [[Turpan]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet fragments dated to the third or fourth century BC were excavated from burial mounds at Bashadar in the [[Ongudai|Ongudai District]], [[Altai Republic]], [[Russia]] by S. Rudenko, the discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets.

=== 13th–14th century: The Konya and Fostat fragments; findings from Tibetan monasteries ===

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the account of his [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travels]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming from Persia, Polo travelled from Sivas to Kayseri. [[Abu'l-Fida]], citing [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] refers to carpet export from Anatolian cities in the lte 13th century: “That's where Turkoman carpets are made, which are exported to all other countries”. He and the Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] mention Aksaray as a major rug weaving center in the early-to-mid-14th century.

Pile woven Turkish carpets were found in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] Period (1243–1302). Eight fragments were found in 1905 by F.R. Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R. State and Court Print|location=Vienna|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in Konya, four in the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]] in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925.&lt;ref name="Beyshehir fragments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riefstahl|first1=Rudolf Meyer|title=Primitive Rugs of the "Konya" type in the Mosque of Beyshehir|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1931|volume=13|issue=4|pages=177–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; More fragments were found in [[Fustat|Fostat]], today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By their original size (Riefstahl reports a carpet up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} long), the Konya carpets must have been produced in town manufactories, as looms of this size cannot be set up in a nomadic or village home. Where exactly these carpets were woven is unknown. The field patterns of the Konya carpets are mostly geometric, and small in relation to the carpet size. Similar patterns are arranged in diagonal rows: Hexagons with plain, or hooked outlines; squares filled with stars, with interposed kufic-like ornaments; hexagons in diamonds composed of rhomboids, rhomboids filed with stylized flowers and leaves. Their main borders often contain kufic ornaments. The corners are not “resolved”, which means that the border design is cut off, and does not continue around the corners. The colours (blue, red, green, to a lesser extent also white, brown, yellow) are subdued, frequently two shades of the same colour are opposed to each other. Nearly all carpet fragments show different patterns and ornaments.

The Beyşehir carpets are closely related to the Konya carpets in design and colour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the "animal carpets" of the following period, depictings of animals are rarely seen in the Seljuq carpet fragments. Rows of horned quadrupeds placed opposite to each other, or birds beside a tree can be recognized on some fragments. A near-complete carpet of this kind is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]]. It has survived in a Tibetan monastery and was removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]].

The style of the Seljuq carpets finds parallels amongst the architectural decoration of contemporaneous mosques such as those at [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği]], [[Sivas]], and [[Erzurum]], and may be related to Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich = The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are today at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya, and at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in Istanbul.

=== Current understanding of the origin of pile-woven carpets ===
Knotted pile woven carpets were likely produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debated whether pile-knotted carpets were initially woven by nomads who tried to imitate animal pelts as tent-floor coverings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were a product of settled peoples. A number of knives was found in the graves of women of a settled community in southwest [[Turkestan]]. The knives are remarkably similar to those used by Turkmen weavers for trimming the pile of a carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=Jungbronzezeitliche Gräberfelder im Sumbar-Tal, Südwest-Turkmenistan = Early Bronze age cemeteries in the Sumbar valley, East Turkestan|date=1986|publisher=Beck|location=München|isbn=978-3406315398|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/29303067?q&amp;versionId=35641318|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=The manufacture of pile carpets in Bronze Age Central Asia.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient motifs on Turkmen carpets closely resemble the ornaments seen on early pottery from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|title=Decorative designs on prehistoric Turkmenian ceramics.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings suggest that Turkestan may be among the first places we know of where pile-woven carpets were produced, but this does not mean it was the only place.

In the light of ancient sources and archaeological discoveries, it seems highly likely that the pile-woven carpet developed from one of the extra-weft wrapping weaving techniques, and was first woven by settled people. The technique has probably evolved separately at different places and times. During the migrations of nomadic groups from Central Asia, the technique and designs may have spread throughout the area which was to become the “rug belt” in later times. With the emergence of Islam, the westward migration of nomadic groups began to change Near Eastern history. After this period, knotted-pile carpets became an important form of art under the influence of Islam, and where the nomadic tribes spread, and began to be known as “Oriental” or “Islamic” carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U.

An oriental rug is woven by hand on a loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made mainly of natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In representative carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.

=== Materials ===

Materials used in carpet weaving and the way they are combined vary in different rug weaving areas. Mainly, animal [[wool]] from sheep and goats is used, occasionally also from camels. Yak and horse hair have been used in Far Eastern, but rarely in Middle Eastern rugs. [[Cotton]] is used for the foundation of the rug, but also in the pile. [[Silk]] from [[Bombyx mori|silk worms]] is used for representational rugs.

==== Wool ====

In most oriental rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=32|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, rug wools come mainly from the [[Fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed]] and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of [[Baluch rug|Baluchi]] and [[Turkmen rug]]s, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|page=25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cotton ====

[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Silk ====

[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets of the Mamluk, Ottoman, and Safavid courts. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design in [[Turkmen rug]]s, but more expensive carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan in Persia, and Istanbul and Hereke in Turkey, have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillow tapestry. Silk is more often used in rugs of Eastern Turkestan and Northwestern China, but these rugs tend to be more coarsely woven.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}

[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. With the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all the rugs produced in the countries of the rug belt use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===

[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5 |Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Vegetal dyes ====

[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used for oriental rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented in oriental rugs since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s, and later on, in Iran.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyzes, natural dyes used in Turkish carpets include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. In some instances, the analysis of the dye has provided information about the provenience of a rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enez|first1=N.|editor1-last=Eiland jr.|editor1-first=M.L.|title=Dye research on the prayer rugs of the Topkapi Collection|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=191–204|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur (perhaps identical with the ''isparek'' plant), or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=54|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insect reds ====

[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=33–34|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====

With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====

The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a pre-planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tools ===
{{see also|Weaving}}
A variety of tools are needed for the construction of a handmade rug. A [[loom]], a horizontal or upright framework, is needed to mount the vertical [[Warp (weaving)|warps]] into which the pile nodes are knotted. One or more shoots of horizontal [[Warp and woof|wefts]] are woven (“shot”) in after each row of knots in order to further stabilize the fabric.

==== Horizontal looms ====

Nomads usually use a horizontal loom. In its simplest form, two loom beams are fastened, and kept apart by stakes which are driven into the ground. The tension of the warps is maintained by driving wedges between the loom beams and the stakes. If the nomad journey goes on, the stakes are pulled out, and the unfinished rug is rolled up on the beams. The size of the loom beams is limited by the need to be easily transportable, thus, genuine nomad rugs are often small in size. In Persia, loom beams were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=22–28|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer the warps are spanned, the more dense the rug can be woven. The width of a rug is always determined by the length of the loom beams. Weaving starts at the lower end of the loom, and proceeds towards the upper end.

Traditionally, horizontal looms were used by the
* [[Kurds]], [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Lurs]], [[Beluch]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] in Persia,
* [[Beluch]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] in Afghanistan and Turkmenistan
* Kurds and nomads ([[Yörük]]) in Anatolia.

==== Vertical looms ====

The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams. While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical loom longer carpets can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved to the back of the loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released, the finished section of the carpet is pulled around the lower beam and upwards on the back of the loom. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, it is wound up on the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.
The vertical loom enables weaving of larger rug formats. The most simple vertical loom, usually used in villages, has fixed beams. The length of the loom determines the length of the rug. As the weaving proceeds, the weavers' benches must be moved upwards, and fixed again at the new working height. Another type of loom is used in manufactures. The wefts are fixed and spanned on the beams, or, in more advanced types of looms, the wefts are spanned on a roller beam, which allows for any length of carpet to be woven, as the finished part of the carpet is rolled up on the roller beam. Thus, the weavers' benches always remain at the same height.

==== Other tools ====

Few essential tools are needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, and a pair of scissors for trimming off the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects from the end of the blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A.

=== Warp, weft, pile ===

[[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] and [[Warp and woof|wefts]] form the foundation of the carpet, the pile accounts for the design. Warps, wefts and pile may consist of any of these materials:

Rugs can be woven with their warp strings held back on different levels, termed sheds. This is done by pulling the wefts of one shed tight, separating the warps on two different levels, which leaves one warp on a lower level. The technical term is “one warp is depressed”. Warps can be depressed slightly, ore more tightly, which will cause a more or less pronounced rippling or “ridging” on the back of the rug. A rug woven with depressed warps is described as “double warped”. Central Iranian city rugs such as Kashan, Isfahan, Qom, and Nain have deeply depressed warps, which make the pile more dense, the rug is heavier than a more loosely woven specimen, and the rug lies more firmly on the floor. Kurdish [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar carpets]] make most pronounced use of warp depression. Often their pile is further compacted by the use of a metal rod which is driven between the warps and hammered down on, which produces a dense and rigid fabric.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L.

=== Knots ===

The pile knots are usually knotted by hand. Most rugs from Anatolia utilize the symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish double knot]]. With this form of knotting, each end of the pile thread is twisted around two warp threads at regular intervals, so that both ends of the knot come up between two warp strings on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The thread is then pulled downwards and cut with a knife.

Most rugs from other provenances use the asymmetric, or [[Persian knot]]. This knot is tied by winding a piece of thread around one warp, and halfway around the next warp, so that both ends of the thread come up at the same side of two adjacent strings of warp on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The pile, i.e., the loose end of the thread, can appear on the left or right side of the warps, thus defining the terms “open to the left” or “open to the right”. Variances in the type of knots are significant, as the type of knot used in a carpet may vary on a regional, or tribal, basis. Whether the knots are open to the left or to the right can be determined by passing one's hands over the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-85669-132-2|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant knot is the so-called jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps. Jufti can be knotted symmetrically or asymmetrically, open to the left or right.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"/&gt;  A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn than traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=366–7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of knot is known from early Spanish rugs. The Spanish knot or single-warp knot, is tied around one single warp. Some of the rug fragments excavated by A. Stein in Turfan seem to be woven with a single knot. Single knot weavings are also known from [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts|Coptic]] pile rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=37–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular knots sometimes occur, and include missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, both symmetric and asymmetric. They are frequently found in Turkmen rugs, and contribute to the dense and regular structure of these rugs.

Diagonal, or offset knotting has knots in successive rows occupy alternate pairs of warps. This feature allows for changes from one half knot to the next, and creates diagonal pattern lines at different angles. It is sometimes found in Kurdish or Turkmen rugs, particularly in Yomuds. It is mostly tied symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The upright pile of oriental rugs usually inclines in one direction, as knots are always pulled downwards before the string of pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling row after row of knots on top of each other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. [[Prayer rug]]s are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends in the direction of the worshipper's prostration).

==== Knot count ====
{{Main|Knot count}}
[[File:Knoopdichtheid ghom.jpg|thumb|Back side of a [[Qom rug]] with very high knot density]]
The knot count is expressed in knots per square inch (''kpsi'') or per square decimeter. Knot count per square decimeter can be converted to square inch by division by 15.5. Knot counts are best performed on the back of the rug. If the warps are not too deeply depressed, the two loops of one knot will remain visible, and will have to be counted as one knot. If one warp is deeply depressed, only one loop of the knot may be visible, which has to be considered when the knots are counted.

Compared to the kpsi counts, additional structural information is obtained when the horizontal and vertical knots are counted separately. In Turkmen carpets, the ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Considerable technical skill is required to achieve this knot ratio. Rugs which are woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Knot counts bear evidence of the fineness of the weaving, and of the amount of labour needed to complete the rug. However, the artistic and utilitarian value of a rug hardly depends on knot counts, but rather on the execution of the design and the colours. For example, Persian Heriz or some Anatolian carpets may have low knot counts as compared to the extremely fine-woven Qom or Nain rugs, but provide artistic designs, and are resistant to wear.

=== Finishing ===
Once the weaving is finished, the rug is cut from the loom. Additional work has to be done before the rug is ready for use.

==== Edges and ends ====

The edges of a rug need additional protection, as they are exposed to particular mechanical stress. The last warps on each side of the rug are often thicker than the inner warps, or doubled. The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by weft shoots looping over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called selvedges, or ''shirazeh'' from the Persian word.

The remaining ends of the warp threads form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in some other manner.  Especially Anatolian village and nomadic rugs have flat-woven [[kilim]] ends, made by shooting in wefts without pile at the beginning and end of the weaving process. They provide further protection against wear, and sometimes include pile-woven tribal signs or village crests.

==== Pile ====

The pile of the carpet is shorn with special knives (or carefully burned down) in order to remove excess pile and obtain an equal surface. In parts of Central Asia, a small sickle-shaped knife with the outside edge sharpened is used for pile shearing. Knives of this shape have been excavated from [[Bronze Age]] sites in Turkmenistan (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=31|isbn=978-0821225486|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In some carpets, a relief effect is obtained by clipping the pile unevenly following the contours of the design. This feature is often seen in [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs.

==== Washing ====

Most carpets are washed before they are used or go to the market. The washing may be done with water and soap only, but more often chemicals are added to modify the colours. Various chemical washings were invented in New York, London, and other European centers. The washing often included chlorine bleach or sodium hydrosulfite. Chemical washings not only damage the wool fibers, but change the colours to an extent that some rugs had to be re-painted with different colours after the washing, as is exemplified by the so-called "American Sarouk" carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

== Design ==

Oriental rugs are known for their richly varied designs, but common traditional characteristics identify the design of a carpet as “oriental”.  With the exception of pile relief obtained by clipping the pile unevenly, rug design originates from a two-dimensional arrangement of knots in various colours. Each knot tied into a rug can be regarded as one "[[pixel]]" of a picture, which is composed by the arrangement of knot after knot. The more skilled the weaver or, as in manufactured rugs, the designer, the more elaborate the design.

=== Rectilinear and curvilinear design ===

{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = ''Left image'': Silk Tabriz Persian rug with a predominantly curvilinear design&lt;br&gt; ''Right image'': Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| footer_align = left | image1 =|Silk Tabriz Persian Rug 7991 with a predominantly curvilinear design| width1 = 185 | caption1  = | image2 =Antique Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, 9ft 11in x 12ft 10in, circa 1875,.jpg|Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| width2 = 200 | caption2 = }}

A rug design is described either as '''rectilinear''' (or “geometric”), or '''curvilinear''' (or “floral”). Curvilinear rugs show floral figures in a realistic manner. The drawing is more fluid, and the weaving is often more complicated. Rectilinear patterns tend to be bolder and more angular. Floral patterns can be woven in rectilinear design, but they tend to be more abstract, or more highly stylized. Rectilinear design is associated with nomadic or village weaving, whereas the intricate curvilinear designs require pre-planning, as is done in factories. Workshop rugs are usually woven according to a plan designed by an artist and handed over to the weaver to execute it on the loom.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|page=170|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===

This feature is typical for [[Turkish carpet|rugs made in Anatolia]].]]

Rug design can also be described by how the surface of the rug is arranged and organized. One single, basic design may cover the entire field (“all-over design”). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Islamic rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments in a manner called "infinite repeat".&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common “Lechek Torūnj” (medallion and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In Persian rugs, the medallion represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinated, creating an impression of the medallion “floating” on the field. Anatolian rugs often use the infinite repeat as the primary pattern, and integrate the medallion as secondary. Its size is often adapted to fit into the infinite repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Oriental rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines or reciprocal trefoils. The latter are frequently found in Caucasian and some Turkish rugs, and are related to the Chinese “cloud collar” (yun chien) motif.&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. Seen in Kerman rugs and Turkish rugs from the late eighteenth century "mecidi" period, this feature was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs. Additional end borders called ''elem'', or skirts, are seen in Turkmen and some Turkish rugs. Their design often differs from the rest of the borders. Elem are used to protect the lower borders of tent door rugs ("ensi"). [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs sometimes do not have any borders.

Designing the carpet borders becomes particularly challenging when it comes to the corner articulations. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be “resolved”. In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver has discontinued the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolutions helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===

The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the ''[[Paisley (design)|boteh]]'' is used throughout the “carpet belt”. Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=36–51|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=51–168|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called “fish”.  Herati patterns are used throughout the “carpet belt”; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Sefavi period, and the “claws” of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.
* The '''[[Gül|Gul]]''' design is frequently found in [[Turkmen rug]]s. Small round or octagonal medallions are repeated in rows all over the field. Although the Gül medallion itself can be very elaborate and colourful, their arrangement within the monochrome field often generates a stern and somber impression. Güls are often ascribed a heraldic function, as it is possible to identify the tribal provenience of a Turkmen rug by its güls.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Turkmen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ian|title=Turkmen.

=== Special designs ===
A different type of field design in a specific Islamic design tradition is used in [[prayer rug]]s. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]], an architectural element in [[mosque]]s intended to direct the worshippers towards the [[Qibla]].  Prayer rugs also show highly symbolic smaller design elements like one or more [[mosque lamp]]s, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]], or water jugs, potentially as a reminder towards ritual cleanliness. Sometimes stylized hands or feet appear in the field to indicate where the worshipper should stand, or to represent the praying person's prostration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=127–143|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other special types include garden, compartment, vase, animal, or pictorial designs

=== The 15th century "design revolution" ===

During the 15th century, a fundamental change appeared in carpet design. Because no carpets survived from this period, research has focused on [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. Earlier Timurid paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with “kufic” border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially the “[[Holbein carpet]]s” that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier “kufic” border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. The resulting change in carpet design was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''“carpet design revolution”'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr.

== Intra- and intercultural contexts ==
[[File:TownVillageNomads.jpg|thumb|Cultural interactions in traditional carpet production]]

Four "social layers" of carpet production can be distinguished: Rugs were woven simultaneously by and for nomads, rural villages, towns, and the royal court. Rural village, and nomad carpet designs represent independent artistic traditions.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Elaborate rug designs from court and town were integrated into village and nomadic design traditions by means of a process termed stylization.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; When rugs are woven for the market, the weavers adapt their production in order to meet the customers' demands, and to maximize their profit. As is the case with Oriental rugs, adaptation to the export market has brought forth both devastating effects on the culture of rug weaving, but has also led to a revival of old traditions in more recent years.

=== Representative ("court") carpets ===
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature by Mir Sayyid Ali, circa 1540. [[British Museum]], London]]

Representative "court" rugs were woven by special workshops, often founded and supervised by the sovereign, with the intention to represent power and status:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=273–275|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman (Byzantine)]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] Empires have coexisted for more than 400 years.

Their elaborate design required a division of work between an artist who created a design plan (termed “cartoon”) on paper, and a weaver who was given the plan for execution on the loom. Thus, artist and weaver were separated.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"/&gt; Their appearance in Persian book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniatures]] as well as in European paintings provides material for their dating by using the [[Terminus post quem|''“terminus ante quem”'']] approach.

=== Town, village, nomadic rugs ===

High-status examples like Safavid or Ottoman court carpets are not the only foundation of the historical and social framework. The reality of carpet production does not reflect this selection: Carpets were simultaneously produced by and for the three different social levels. Patterns and ornaments from court manufactory rugs have been reproduced by smaller (town or village) workshops. This process is well documented for Ottoman prayer rugs.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; As prototypical court designs were passed on to smaller workshops, and from one generation to the next, the design underwent a process termed stylization, comprising series of small, incremental changes either in the overall design, or in details of smaller patterns and ornaments, over time. As a result, the prototype may be modified to an extent as to barely being recognizable. A mihrab column may change into a detached row of ornaments, a Chinese dragon may undergo stylization until it becomes unrecognizable in a Caucasian dragon carpet.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

Pile rugs and flat weaves were essential items in all rural households and nomadic tents. They were part of a tradition that was at times influenced, but essentially distinct from the invented designs of the workshop production. Frequently, mosques had acquired rural carpets as [[Waqf|charitable gifts]], which provided material for studies.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, Vakiflar Museum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpinar|first1=Belkis|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel, Germany|isbn=9783923185047|edition=German/English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural carpets rarely include cotton for warps and wefts, and almost never silk, as these materials had to be purchased on the market.

With the end of the traditional [[Transhumance|nomadic lifestyle]] in large parts of the rug belt area, and the consequent loss of specific traditions, it has become difficult to identify a genuine “nomadic rug”. Tribes known for their nomadic lifestyle like the [[Yürük]] in Anatolia, or the [[Kurds]] and [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] in contemporary Turkey and Southwestern Iran have voluntarily or by force acquired sedentary lifestyles. Migration of peoples and tribes, in peace or warfare, has frequently happened throughout the history of [[Turkic peoples]], as well as Persian and Caucasian tribes. Some designs may have been preserved, which can be identified as specifically nomadic or tribal.&lt;ref name="Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Housego|first1=Jenny|title=Tribal Rugs|date=1998|publisher=Olive Branch Press|location=London|isbn=9781566562188|edition=1998 reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Black Oriental Carpets"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=David|last2=Loveless|first2=Clive|title=Woven Gardens: Nomad and Village Rugs of the Fars Province of Southern Persia|date=1979|publisher=David Black Oriental Carpets|location=London|isbn=9780950501833|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mackie|editor1-first=Louise|editor2-last=Thompson|editor2-first=Jon|title=Turkmen: Tribal Carpets and Traditions|date=1980|publisher=The Textile Museum|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=9780295965956|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Nomadic” rugs can be identified by their material, construction, and colours.

Criteria for nomadic production include:&lt;ref name="Brueggemann/Boehmer, 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann, W., and Boehmer, H.|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unusual materials like warps made of goat's hair, or camel wool in the pile;
* high quality wool with long pile (Anatolian and Turkmen nomads);
* small format fitting for a horizontal loom;
* irregular format due to frequent re-assembly of the loom, resulting in irregular tension of the warps;
* pronounced abrash (irregularities within the same colour due to dyeing of yarn in small batches);
* inclusion of flat weaves at the ends.

Within the genre of carpet weaving, the most authentic village and nomadic products were those woven to serve the needs of the community, which were not intended for export or trade other than local. This includes specialized bags and bolster covers (''yastik'') in Anatolia, which show designs adapted from the earliest weaving traditions.&lt;ref name="Steiner, Heybe ve Torba"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Pinkwart|first2=Doris|last3=Ammermann|first3=Eberhart|title=Bergama Heybe ve Torba: Traditional bags of the Yürüks in Northwest Anatolia, Observations from 1970 to 2007 / Traditionelle Taschen der Yürüken Nordwest-Anatoliens.

Smaller (''torba'') and midsize (''mafrash'') and a variety of special bags to keep bread or salt were woven. They are usually made of two sides, one or both of them pile or flat-woven, and then sewn together. Long tent bands woven in mixed pile and flat weave adorned the tents, and carpets known as ''ensi'' covered the entrance of the tent, while the door was decorated with a pile-woven door surround. Turkmen, and also tribes like the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] nomads of western Iran, or the [[Qashqai people]] wove animal trappings like saddle covers, or special decorations for weddings like ''asmalyk'', pentagonally shaped camel coverings used for wedding decorations. Tribal signs like the Turkmen [[Gül]] can support the assessment of provenience.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

=== Symbolism and the origin of patterns ===

Beattie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackie|first1=Louise W.|title=May Hamilton Beattie|journal=Oriental carpet and texile studies|date=1987|volume=III|issue=1|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1908–1997), a distinguished scholar in the field of carpet studies, wrote in 1976:&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia : with special references to rugs of Kirman.|date=1976|publisher=World of Islam Festival Pub.

{{Quotation|The symbolism of Oriental rug designs has recently been made the subject of a number of articles. Many of the ideas put forward are of great interest, but to attempt to discuss such a subject without a profound knowledge of the philosophies of the East would be unwise, and could easily provide unreliable food for unbridled imaginations. One may believe implicitly in certain things, but especially if they have an ancient religious basis, it may not always be possible to prove them. Such ideas merit attention.|May H. Beattie, ''Carpets of central Persia'', 1976, p. 19}}

Oriental rugs from various proveniences often share common motifs. Various attempts have been made to determine the potential origin of these ornaments. Woven motifs of folk art undergo changes through processes depending on human creativity, trial and error, and unpredictable mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vavilov's theory of origins|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also through the more active process of stylization. The latter process is well documented, as the integration into the work of rural village and nomad weavers of patterns designed in town manufactures can be followed on carpets which still exist. In the more archaic motifs, the process of pattern migration and evolution cannot be documented, because the material evidence does not exist any more. This has led to various speculations about the origins and “meanings” of patterns, often resulting in unsubstantiated claims.

==== Prehistoric symbolism ====

In 1967, the British archaeologist James Mellaart claimed to have found the oldest records of flat woven [[kilim]]s on wall paintings he discovered in the [[Çatalhöyük]] excavations, dated to circa 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=R. H.|title=Catal Huyuk. A Neolithic Town in Anatolia. James Mellaart. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967. 232 pp., illus. $9.95|journal=Science|date=22 September 1967|volume=157|issue=3795|pages=1419–1420|doi=10.1126/science.157.3795.1419}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drawings Mellaart claimed to have made before the wall paintings disappeared after their exposure showed clear similarities to nineteenth century designs of Turkish flatweaves. He interpreted the forms, which evoked a female figure, as evidence of a Mother Goddess cult in Çatalhöyük. A well-known pattern in Anatolian kilims, sometimes referred to as ''[[Elibelinde]]'' (lit.: “hands on hips”), was therefore determined to depict the Mother Goddess herself. This theory had to be abandoned after Mellaarts claims were denounced as fraudulent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlamallett.com/ch.htm Oriental Rug Review, August/September 1990 (Vol. 10, No. 6)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his claims refuted by other archaeologists. The elibelinde motif lost its divine meaning and prehistoric origin. It is today understood as a design of stylized carnation flowers, and its development can be traced back in a detailed and unbroken line to Ottoman court carpets of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Apotropaic symbols ====

[[File:Amulet Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|[[Amulet]] (Muska) [[kilim motifs|kilim motif]], for protection (3 examples)]]

Symbols of protection against evil are frequently found on Ottoman and later Anatolian carpets. The Turkish name for these symbols is ''nazarlık'' (lit.: "[protection from] the evil eye"). [[Apotropaic magic|Apotropaic]] symbols include the [[Cintamani]] motif, often depicted on white ground [[Ushak carpet|Selendi]] carpets, which consists of three balls and a pair of wavy stripes. It serves the same purpose as protective inscriptions like "May God protect", which are seen woven into rugs. Another protective [[Kilim motifs|symbol often woven into carpets]] is the triangular talisman pendant, or "''muska''". This symbol is found in Anatolian, Persian, Caucasian and Central Asian carpets.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Tribal symbols ====
Some carpets include symbols which serve as a tribal crest and sometimes allow for the identification of the weaver's tribe. This is especially true for Turkmen pile woven textiles, which depict a variety of different medallion-like polygonal patterns called [[Gul (design)|Gul]], arranged in rows all over the field. While the origin of the pattern can be traced back to Buddhist depictions of the lotus blossom,&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"/&gt; it remains questionable if the weaver of such a tribal symbol was aware of its origins.

==== "Kufic" borders ====

Early Anatolian carpets often show a geometric border design with two arrowhead-like extensions in a sequence of tall-short-tall. By its similarity to the [[kufic]] letters of alif and lām, borders with this ornament are called "kufic" borders. The letters are thought to represent the word “[[Allah]]”. Another theory relates the tall-short-tall ornament to split-palmette motifs. The "alif-lām" motif is already seen on early Anatolian carpets from the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]].&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

==== Symbolism of the prayer rug ====
[[File:Shirvan 01.jpg|thumb|Shirvan Prayer rug with a rectangular niche, depicting inwoven hands and an ornament representing the mosque lamp]]

The symbolism of the Islamic [[Prayer rug]] is more easily understandable. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]] in every mosque, a directional point to direct the [[worship]]per towards [[Mecca]]. Often one or more [[mosque lamp]]s hang from the point of the arch, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]]. Sometimes a comb and pitcher are depicted, which is a reminder for Muslims to wash their hands and for men to comb their hair before performing prayer. Stylized hands are woven in the rug pile, indicating where the hands should be placed when performing prayer, often also interpreted as the [[Hamsa]], or “Hand of Fatima”, a protective amulet against the [[evil eye]].

=== Cultural effects of commercialization ===

Since the beginning of the Oriental rug trade in the High Middle Ages, Western market demand has influenced the rug manufacturers producing for export, who had to adapt their production in order to accommodate Western market demands. The commercial success of oriental rugs, and the [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]] thinking which arose during the sixteenth century, led European sovereigns to initiate and promote carpet manufactories in their European home countries. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Western companies set up weaving facilities in the rug-producing countries, and commissioned designs specifically invented according to Western taste.

Rugs exist which are known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the technique and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Sweden]], flat and pile woven rugs (called “''[[Rya (rug)|rya]]''”, or “''rollakan''”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster carpets]] were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the [[Savonnerie manufactory]] began weaving pile carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “''mecidi''”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company [[Ziegler &amp; Co.]] maintained workshops in [[Tabriz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Sultanabad]] (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as [[Liberty &amp; Company]] and [[Harvey Nichols]]. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansel|first1=Antony Wynn ; with a foreword by Philip|title=Three camels to Smyrna: times of war and peace in Turkey, Persia, India, Afghanistan &amp; Nepal, 1907-1986 : the story of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Company|date=2008|publisher=Hali|location=London|isbn=9781898113676}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, the Western invention of synthetic [[dye]]s had a devastating effect on the traditional way of carpet production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bode|first1=Wilhelm von|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche aus alter Zeit|date=1902|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|page=158 ff|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neugebauer, R |author2=Orendi, J|title=Handbuch der Orientalischen Teppichkunde|date=1920|publisher=Karl W. Hiersemann|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-86444-955-0|pages=81–82|edition=Reprint 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early twentieth century, carpets were woven in the cities of [[Saruq, Markazi|Saruk]] and [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], Iran and the surrounding villages mainly for export to the U.S. While the sturdy construction of their pile appealed to U.S. American customers, their designs and colours did not fit in with the demands. The traditional design of the Saruk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=141–142|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its home countries, the ancient art and craft of carpet weaving has been revived. Since the early 1980s, initiatives were ongoing like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative|DOBAG project]] in Turkey, in Iran,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and by various social projects in Afghanistan and amongst Tibetan refugees in Northern India. Naturally dyed, traditionally woven rugs are available on the Western market again.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique carpets sold at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

=== Forgery ===
Oriental rugs have always attracted collectors' interest, and sold at high prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/persian-rug-carpet-sells-world-record-price-475630 |title=Persian Rug Sells For World Record $33.7m |publisher=International Business Times |first=Hannah |last=Osborne |work=ibtimes.co.uk |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been an incentive for fraudulent behaviour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Techniques used traditionally in rug restoration, like replacing knots, or re-weaving parts of a rug, can also be used to modify a rug so as to appear older or more valuable than it actually is. Old flatweaves can be unravelled to obtain longer threads of yarn which can then be re-knitted into rugs. These forgeries are able to overcome [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] dye analysis and [[radiocarbon dating]], since they make use of period material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hebborn|first1=Eric|title=The Art Forger's Handbook|date=1997|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0304349143|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romanian artisan Teodor Tuduc has become famous for his fake oriental rugs, and the stories which he delivered in order to gain credibility. The quality of his forgeries was such that some of his rugs found their way into museum collections, and “Tuduc rugs” have themselves become collectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Handbook of Fakes by Tuduc (world's most famous rug forger), published on the occasion of the Volkmann-Treffen Symposium, Berlin, October, 2012|date=2012|publisher=Stefano Ionescu|location=Rome|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugs by regions ==
Oriental rugs can be classified by their region of origin, each of which represents different strands of tradition: [[Persian rug]]s, [[Pakistani rug]]s, [[Arabian carpet|Arabian rug]]s, [[Turkish carpet|Anatolian rug]]s, [[Kurdish rug]]s, [[Caucasian carpets and rugs|Caucasian rugs]], Central Asian rugs, [[Turkish rug|Turkestanian (Turkmen, Turkoman) rugs]], [[Chinese rug]]s, [[Tibetan rug]]s and Indian rugs.

=== Persian (Iranian) rugs ===

{{main article|Persian carpet}}
The Persian carpet or Persian rug is an essential and distinguished part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Persian art|art]], and dates back to [[Persian Empire|ancient Persia]].
Persian carpets are classified by the social setting in which they were woven (nomads, villages, town and court manufactories), by ethnic groups (e.g. [[Kurds]], nomadic tribes such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] or [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]]; [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmens]]) and others, or by the town or province where carpets are woven, such as [[Heriz]], [[Hamadan]], [[Senneh]], [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] (Sultanabad), [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Kashan]], [[Qom]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]], and others. A technical classification for Persian carpets is based on material used for warps, wefts, and pile, spinning and plying of the yarn, dyeing, weaving technique, and aspects of finishing including the ways how the sides (selvedges) and ends are reinforced against wear.

=== Anatolian (Turkish) rugs ===
{{main article|Turkish carpet}}
Turkish carpets are produced mainly in [[Anatolia]], including neighbouring areas. Carpet weaving is a traditional art in Anatolia, dating back to pre-Islamic times, and integrates different cultural traditions reflecting the history of [[Turkic peoples]]. Turkish carpets form an essential part of the Turkish culture.

Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is distinguished by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]], or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets date from the thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, as well as in villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets ([[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.
Following a decline which began in the second half of the nineteenth century, initiatives like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative]] in 1982, or the [[Turkish Cultural Foundation]] in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.&lt;ref name="TCF Natural Dyes Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Cultural Foundation|url=http://www.tcfdatu.org/en/home/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish carpet is distinct from carpets of other provenience in that it makes more pronounced use of primary colours. Western Anatolian carpets prefer red and blue colours, whereas Central Anatolian use more red and yellow, with sharp contrasts set in white. With the exceptions of representative court and town manufacture designs, Turkish carpets make more pronounced use of bold geometric, and highly stylized floral patterns, generally in rectilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMullan|first1=Joseph V.|title=Islamic Carpets|date=1965|publisher=Near Eastern Art Research Center|location=New York|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian Mamluk rugs ===
[[File:The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet.jpg|thumb|The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet]]

Under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], a distinctive carpet was produced in Egypt. Called "Damascene" carpets by previous centuries, there is no doubt now that the center of production was [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

European and Islamic Sources from the 15.-18. Century|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to nearly all other oriental rugs, Mamluk carpets used “S” (clockwise) spun and “Z” (anti-clockwise)-plied wool. Their palette of colours and shades is limited to bright red, pale blue, and light green, blue and yellow are rarely found. The field design is characterized by polygonal medallions and stars and stylized floral patterns, arranged in a linear way along their central axis, or centralized. The borders contain rosettes, often alternating with cartouches. As [[Edmund de Unger]] pointed out, the design is similar to other products of Mamluk manufacture, like wood- and metal work, and book bindings, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] and floor mosaics.&lt;ref name="de Unger, Mamluk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Unger|first1=Edmund|title=The Origin of the Mamluk Carpet Design|journal=Hali|date=1980|volume=2|issue=4|pages=321–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamluk carpets were made for the court, and for export, Venice being the most important market place for Mamluk rugs in Europe.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

After the 1517 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. The Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt, and probably also in Anatolia, into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caucasian provinces of [[Karabagh]], Moghan, [[Shirvan]], [[Daghestan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] formed the northern territories of the [[Safavid Empire]]. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], 1813, the provinces were finally ceded to Russia. Russian rule was further extended to [[Baku]], [[Genje]], the [[Derbent]] khanate, and the region of [[Talish]]. In the 19th century the main weaving zone of the Caucasus was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, in a region which today comprises [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1990, Richard E. Wright claimed that ethnicities other than the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri population]] "also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Carpets xv. Caucasian Carpets – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian population surveys from 1886 and 1897&lt;ref&gt;cited in Eiland &amp; Eiland, 1998, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the ethnic distribution of the population is extremely complex in the southern Caucasus. With regard to antique carpets and rugs, the weavers' identity or ethnicity remains unknown. Eiland &amp; Eiland stated in 1998 that "it should not be taken for granted that the majority population in a particular area was also responsible for the weaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiland|first1=Murray L.

The debate is still ongoing, and remains unresolved.

In 1728 the Polish Jesuit Thaddaeus Krusinski wrote that at the beginning of the seventeenth century Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] had established carpet manufactories in Shirvan and Karabagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tadeusz Jan Krusiński |first1=T.

Characteristic motifs include stylized Chinese dragons in the so-called '''“Dragon carpets”''', combat scenes of tigers and stags, or floral motifs. The style is highly abstract to an extent that the animal forms become unrecognizable, unless compared to earlier Safavid animals and 16th century "vase style" carpets depicting the same motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Bode |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Kühnel |first2=Ernst |title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra.

Among the most popular groups of Caucasian rugs are the '''“Star Kazak”'''&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=D. |last2=Franses |first2=M. |last3=Pinner |first3=R. |title=Caucasian Carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum |journal=Hali |date=1980 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirchheim |first1=H. |title=Orient Stars.

A precise classification of Caucasian rugs is particularly difficult, even compared to other types of oriental rugs. Virtually no information is available from before the end of the nineteenth century, when Caucasian rugs began to be exported in larger numbers. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] socialistic economy, carpet production was organized in industrial lines in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Daghestan and Georgia, which used standardized designs based on traditional motifs, provided on scalepaper cartoons by specialized artists.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In 1927, the Azerbaijani Carpet Association was founded as a division of the Azerbaijani Art Association. At their factories, wool and cotton were processed and handed out to the weavers, who had to join the association.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zollinger|first1=Werner|last2=Kerimov|first2=Latif|last3=Azadi|first3=Siawosh U.|title=Azerbaijani-Caucasian rugs|date=2001|publisher=Ulmke Collection|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-3925813108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azerbaijani scholar [[Latif Karimov]] wrote&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; that between 1961 and 1963, a technical college devoted to teaching carpet weaving was built, in 1961, the National Azerbaijan M.A. Aliev Institute of Art opened a department headed by Karimov, which specialized on the training of carpet designers.

Detailed ethnographic information is available from the works of ethnologists like [[Vsevolod Miller]] and Soviet Russian surveys conducted by the [[Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography]] (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Field|first1=H.|title=Contributions to the Anthropology of the Caucasus.|journal=Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology|date=1953|volume=1|issue=48|publisher=Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, during the long period of industrial production, the connection between specific designs and their ethnic and geographic origins may have been lost. Research was published mainly in Russian language, and still is not fully available to non-Russian speaking scientists.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; From a Western perspective, when scientific interest started to develop in Oriental rugs by the end of the nineteenth century, the Caucasian regions, being part of the Soviet Union, closed up to the West. Thus, Western information about carpet weaving in the Caucasian countries was not as detailed as from other regions of the "carpet belt".&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"/&gt;

Different classifications have been proposed, however, many trade names and labels have been kept merely as terms of convenience, and future research may allow for more precise classification.&lt;ref name="Schurmann, Caucasian 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schurmann|first1=Ulrich|title=Caucasian Rugs.|date=1974|publisher=Crosby|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0903580151|edition=3rd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright, Caucasus 1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Rugs and flatweaves of the Transcaucasus : a commentary|date=1980|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|isbn=978-0960421008|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, archival research from earlier Russian and Soviet sources has been included,&lt;ref name="Wright and Wertime, Caucasian 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wertime|first2=John T.|title=Caucasian carpets &amp; covers : the weaving culture|date=1995|publisher=Hali Publ. in ass. with King|location=London|isbn=978-1856690775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperations were initiated between Western and Azerbaijani experts.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; They propose the study of flatweaves as the major indigenous folk art of the Caucasus, and worked on more specific and detailed classifications.

==== Classification by Zollinger, Karimov, and Azadi ====

Zollinger, Kerimov and Azadi propose a classification for Caucasian rugs woven from the late 19th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; Essentially, they focus on six provenances:

* '''Kuba''' relates to a district and its town, located between Baku and Derbent, the Samur river constituting its northern, the southern crest of the Caucasus its southern border.Kuba borders the Baku district in the southeast, and the Caspian Sea n the east. Kuba rugs are classified as town rugs, with dense ornamentation, high knot density, and short pile. Warps are made of wool, not dyed and dark ivory. Wefts are of wool, wool and cotton, or cotton. One of two wefts is often deeply depressed. Knots are symmetrical. Plain-woven Soumakh ends of dark wool or light blue cotton are frequent, white cotton soumakhs are rare. The fringes are braided, pleated, or artistically knotted. The selvedges are mainly round (in that case, in dark blue wool) or 0.3–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide and made of light blue wool, reinforced over two ribs by figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The colours are dark and the rugs look hardly polychrome despite the fact that they use 10–12 different colours, because their ornaments are small and arranged densely on the rug. The majority of Kuba rugs have a dark blue background. Red or dark red rarely occur, sometimes ivory, rarely yellow and hardly any green.
* '''Shirvan''' is the name of the town and province, located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, east of the Kura river, between the southern part of the river and the city of Derbent in the north. Kerimov distinguished six districts, which weave different types of rugs. Some Shirvan rugs come with a high knot density and short pile. More coarsely woven carpets have a higher pile. Symmetrical knots are used, woven with alternate warps depressed. The weft is generally of wool, in dark ivory to brown. The ends are flat-woven, light cotton or wool sumakh. The fringes are sometimes artistically knotted. The selvedges are either round, or 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide, in white cotton, with 2–3 ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. White cotton selvedges are the most common in Shirvan rugs. Shirvan rugs may have town, or village designs, but less densely ornamented as compared to Kuba rugs, and the drawing is more sparse. Compared to Kuba rugs, Shirvan rugs are lighter, and more colourful, with a dark blue background. The borders often have a light background which is more sparsely ornamented compared to the central field. Light ivory, red or yellow rarely occur. Ivory is mainly used for prayer rugs.
* '''Gyanya''' (Genje) is a large city, located ca. {{convert|360|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku.In contrast to the more urban design of Kuba and Shirvan, rugs from other provenances have longer piles. On average, the pile of Gyanya rugs is 6–15&amp;nbsp;mm high. The warp is generally darker, mainly wool, not dyed dark or light brown. Camel hair is said to be used for warps as well. Wefts are commonly dyed light to dark brownish red. Three wefts are often shot in after each row of knots, but warps are not depressed. The upper end is often {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} long brownish-red tapestry weave, turned over and sewn on. The lower end is frequently red woolen tapestry weave, with the warp loops uncut. Selvedges are rarely round, but flat and wide, mainly dark brownish red, and consist of three ribs with figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The second most common shape is similar, but includes only two ribs. Gyanya rugs are more generously and sparsely ornamented, as compared to Kuba and Shirvan weavings. Large square, rectangular, hexagonal and octagonal patterns are set within more open space. Medallions (gul) are often hooked. The colour palette is more restricted than in Kuba and Shirvan rugs, but distributed over larger areas, so that the overall impression is more colourful.
* '''Kazak''' according to Latimov refers to a district and its center town located between the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic towards the northwest into the Republic of Georgia and towards the southwest into the Republic of Armenia. The city of Kasak lies {{convert|460|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku. The warp of Kazak rugs is of sheep wool, not dyed, rather dark ivory, sometimes camel hair is said to be used. The weft is of wool, or a blend of wool and camel hair. Sometimes wool and cotton threads are only slightly plied together to form the warp thread. Wefts are dyed mostly in light red, wefts in dark blue distinguish the Kazak from Karabakh rugs. 2–6 wefts are shot in after each row of knots. The pile is wool, sometimes undyed camel hair, the knots being symmetrical, the warps not depressed. Kazak rugs are woven more coarsely, their pile being 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm high. The upper end is fastened with a 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm wide woolen tapestry weave in red colours. The lower end is often finished like the upper end, but uncut warp loops are often seen protruding from the flat-woven end. Selvedges are nearly always flat nd between 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm wide, consisting of two ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads, these often in different colours. In most cases, two double warps are wrapped three times. Kazak rugs have a limited colour palette of 5–7 colours. In general, the field has a red background, less frequently also ivory, green, blue, or yellow, the colour of the main border often in contrasting colours. The colour of the main borders is often difficult to identify due to the dense ornamentation. Kazak rugs woven before ca. 1910 have more intense and bright colours than rugs woven after this year.
* '''Karabagh''' extends between the rivers Kura and Araz up to the mountains of the small Caucasus. The rugs woven in the different regions of the Karabagh area differ substantially from each other. Rugs from the easternmost parts of the Karabagh area have cotton wefts and light blue cotton or wool selvedges. In some regions (Mokan, Talysh, Lenkoran) the rugs have runner formats, approximately three times as long as wide. Apart from manufacture rugs, Karabagh rugs have a high pile, up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. According to Karimov, some types of rugs like the "Eagle Kazak", Cloud band Kazak, or Kasymushak Kazaks, have actually been woven in Karabagh. Their upper and lower ends are often fllat-woven, folded towards the back, and sewn on.
* '''Nakhichevan''' is located between Armenia and Iran. No information was available on this region to the authors of this classification.

=== Turkmen rugs ===
{{main article|Turkmen rug}}
{{see also|Yomut carpet}}

[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two Turkmen men standing on a ''Halı'' main carpet with Tekke göl, in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]

[[Turkmen people|Turkmen tribes]] inhabited the area between the [[Amu Darya]] river, the [[Caspian Sea]], [[Aral Sea]] and towards the borders of modern-time Iran and Afghanistan. They produced rugs and smaller pile woven textiles in various sizes, including main carpets (''halı''), tent door hangings (''ensi''), and other household items like tent door decorations (''khalyk'' or ''kapunuk''), tent bags (''torba''), large bags (''chuval''), smaller bags (''mafrash''), saddle bags (''Khordjin''), animal covers (''[[asmalyk]]''), and tent bands.

Many archaic components of Turkmen representative arts have survived into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsareva|first1=Elena|title=Turkmen Carpets: Masterpieces of Steppe Art, from 16th to 19th Centuries: The Hoffmeister Collection|date=2011|publisher=Arnoldsche Art Publishers|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783897903425|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Turkmen were an ancient, Iranian-speaking ethnicity in the western Central Asian steppes and oases. Their military administrative organization in tribes was traced back to the influence of the [[Huns]].(&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atayev|first1=K.|title=Nekotorye dannye po etnografii turkmen shikov|journal=Studies of the Institute of Ethnography and Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the TSSR|volume=VII|trans-title=Some ethnographic data on the Turkmen shikhs|location=Ashkabad|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited in&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Akbar S.|title=Islam in tribal societies : from the Atlas to the Indus|date=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Paul|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0710093202|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Turkish influence came with the [[Hephthalite Empire]] in the sixth century AD, and, to a larger extent, by the immigration of the [[Oghuz Turks]] in the ninth and tenth century AD. The Oghuz assimilated the local population, who converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"/&gt; The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the thirteenth century AD led to the destruction of the cities and agricultural irrigation systems, and reduced the Turkmen people to a nomadic lifestyle which they have kept throughout their later history, living at the borders of more powerful states like the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. Less amenable to assimilation than their neighbours, they were able to preserve much of their traditional culture. During the nineteenth century, the Turkmen came under the influence of the [[Russian Empire]]. With the end of the [[Soviet Union]], the former Turkmen socialist republic turned into the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]].

The [[History of Turkmenistan|history of the Turkmen]] tribes is characterized by migrations, alliances, intertribal warfare, even by the violent extinction of regional populations. Knowledge of both the history of a Turkmen tribe and its migrations, and the characteristics of their structure and design, often allows for the attribution of a rug or pile-woven household item to a certain tribe, and to a certain period in its history. The diversity of the colours and ornaments, as well as their potential symbolic meaning, constitutes the subject of a large, sometimes controversial, body of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jourdan|first1=Uwe|title=Oriental rugs Vol. V: Turkoman|date=1989|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1851491360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Eilland, Jr.|first2=Murray J.|title=Between the Black Desert and the Red : Turkmen carpets from the Wiedersperg collection ; [published on the occasion of an Exhibition Between the Black Desert and the Red - Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.

Typical for nomadic weaving, the wool of Turkmen rugs is of high quality, with a fairly long pile. Sheep wool, goat's hair and cotton are used for the foundation. The pile is made from wool, and often also contains silk. The predominant colour in nearly all Turkmen rugs is [[Rubia tinctorum|madder red]], which was obtained locally, and allows for dyeing in various shades. The different tribes used distinct shades of red. The predominance of the red colour in Turkmen rugs creates a monotonous impression on first sight, but the minor ornaments are woven in a great variety of colours. The most prominent ornament in Turkmen rugs is the [[Gul (design)|gul]], a medallion-like polygonal pattern which is arranged in rows all over the field. Specific gul were used as tribal emblems in a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] manner.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moshkova|first1=Valentina G.|editor1-last=O' Bannon|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Amanova Olsen|editor2-first=Ovadan K.|title=Carpets of the people of Central Asia of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries|date=1996|publisher=O'Bannon|location=Tucson|isbn=9780965342100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, main (termed “göl”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;), and secondary, less elaborate gul (termed “gül”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;) can be distinguished, “gul” being the more generic name for this type of ornament. Gul were also used depending on the type of rug or household item. Main carpets usually display the main göl of the tribe, whereas tent door covers and bags show special gul.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Primary göl in Turkmen rugs include:&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George W.|title=The Turkoman carpet|date=1974|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715607404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gülli or gushli göl: Lobed göl which includes a square ornament, from which tre-foiled ornaments on a stem protrude. Used by the Tekke, Salor and Ersari, and by some weavers of the Saryk. “Gülli” means "flower" in Turkmen, “gushli” (from “kush” or “gush”) means “bird”. 
* Tauk-Nuska göl: Divided into four quarters in diagonally opposed colours, each quarter shows two stylized animals. Common in many tribes, it is mainly used by Arabachi, Chodor, some groups of the Yomud and Ersari including the Kizil Ayak.
* Tekke göl: Design variation of the gülli göl. Round shape set on the coordinates of a dark blue lattice, which divides each gül into four sections with diagonally opposed colours.
* Saryk göl: Similar to the Tekke göl, but not arranged on a lattice framework. Often seen on Saryk main carpets, also called Chuval göl because of its use on large bags (''chuval'').
* Dyrnak göl - literally: “Comb göl”. Rhomboid göl adorned with rows of hooks, resembling combs, opposite rows of hooks are in the same colour. Used by the Yomud tribe
* Kepse göl: Used mainly by the Yomud tribe, rhomboid göl surrounded by two-coloured crenellations.
* Eagle göl: At least two, if not three groups of rugs are distinguished by this design feature, which has not yet been attributed to any specific tribe.
* "C" göls: Octagon within an octagon filled with patterns resembling the letter “C”.

Turkmen carpets can be woven with both symmetric, and asymmetric knots, open to the left and to the right. Irregular knots are also frequent, including missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, are seen, both symmetric and asymmetric. Often warps are deeply depressed. Pile, warp and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Rugs woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

The '''Salor''' confederation (consisting mainly of the Salor proper and Saryk) is believed to have lived originally in the Amu Darya valley, and the oases of southern Turkmenistan, including [[Merv]]. They used bright shades of madder red. The typical Salor göl has a lobed rosette shade, upright-cross division and motif-filling. Its four central quarters are dyed in diagonally opposed colours. The style of colouring is labelled “Central Asian”. The göl are arranged on the main field of a carpet in a way that makes them appear to “float” on the field, creating the impression of a diagonal movement.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt; A group of Turkmen carpets with common structural features were termed “'''S-group'''” and identified as Salor rugs by Mackie and Thompson.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; The carpets of the “S-group” are asymmetrically knotted, open to the left. Warps are ivory, with alternate warps deeply depressed, wefts of two-ply brown wool, occasionally dyed red. Their pile is less supple than other Turkmen rugs, fairly long. Sometimes silk is used, but rarely cotton. Red colour is mostly from madder, but lac and cochineal reds have been found.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; Older Saryk weavings often have symmetric knots.

'''Tekke''' rugs are distinguished by the use of the Tekke göl. They are asymmetrically knotted, almost always open to the right. Alternate warps are rarely deeply depressed. The red colours are dyed in madder, but also cochineal red can be found. In the nineteenth century, synthetic dyes have been used. Warps are often of ivory yarn with a large component of ivory goat's hair. The selvage is overcast in dark blue.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rautenstengel|first1=Anette|last2=Rautenstengel|first2=Volker|last3=Pakbin|first3=Ali|title=Studien zur Teppich-Kultur der Turkmen = Studies on Turkmen Carpet Culture|date=1990|publisher=A. Rautenstengel|location=Hilden|isbn=978-3980259606|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Yomud''' rugs are of a similar structure, with less depressed warps. The red field colour of Yomud rugs is more subdued with a brown hue. Knots are asymmetric, open to the left. Typical göl are ''dyrnak'' and ''kepse'' göl.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"/&gt;
The most common field colour of '''Chaudor''' rugs is a purplish chestnut brown. White appears more prominently, also dark and light blue, green and yellow. The warps are made of dark wool, whereas the wefts include white cotton. Knotting is asymmetrical and open to the right, which helps distinguishing Chaudor from Yomud rugs. Tauk nuska göls are common in Chaudor rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munkacsi|first1=Kurt|title=Dividing the Chaudor|journal=Hali|date=1994|issue=26|pages=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carpet weaving tribes include the Arabatchi, Ersari and Beshiri.

==== Commercialization and revival ====

With the beginning of commercialization in the nineteenth century, carpets were produced for export in Russia and Afghanistan. Known under the trade name of “Bokhara rugs”, they show designs inspired by Turkmen carpets, but the colours and the quality of design did not match the original. With the end of the Soviet Union, national states were established in the area. Within general activities to revive the ancient tradition of hand-spinning, natural dyeing, and hand weaving, projects to support refugees from Afghanistan have taken a part in the “carpet renaissance”.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"/&gt;

=== Indian and Pakistani rugs ===

The two states, India and Pakistan, separated in 1947 at the [[Partition of India]]. The tradition of carpet weaving, however, was common to the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, they are described together in this section. Unless otherwise indicated, "India" in this section refers to the Indian subcontinent.

Rug weaving was known in India at least since the sixteenth century. The original models were probably Persian, since their designs appear closely related. Other influences came from central Asia, but India soon developed a style of her own. The most elaborate carpets were woven under the [[Mughal Empire]] during the late sixteenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Further southwards, the rugs woven in the Deccan area are distinguished by their colours and design.

Pile rugs made of wool are not essential household items in the hot and humid climate of India. They might have been introduced by succeeding waves of migrants from central and western Asia. The first people to invade India from the Eurasian steppe were the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryans]] at around 1800 BC. The Aryans were nomadic people subsiding on animal breeding. It has been suggested that they might have introduced sheep breeding, and the production of woolen textiles to Northwestern India.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In the sixth century BC, India was invaded by the [[Hephthalite Empire]], another steppe nomad culture. In the fourth and fifth century BC, some areas were ruled by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. To what extent these peoples were already weaving pile carpets remains unknown, since no carpets exist from this period to support the hypothesis. The earliest references to Indian carpets come from Chinese writers during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Pinner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Denny|editor2-first=Walter|title=Indian and Kashmiri carpets before Akbar: Their perceived history|journal=Oriental carpet and textile studies|date=1987|volume=III|issue=1|pages=119–126|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Arab invasion of [[Sindh]] in 712, India came in touch with Islam. The Afghan [[Ghaznavids]] and their successors, the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghaurids]], further spread Islam in India. The Arabian geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi]] mentions carpets from Sindh in 985 AD.&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"/&gt; Carpet weaving can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Empire in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to India and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Baburs successor, [[Humayun]], took refuge in the Persian Safavid court of Shah [[Tahmasp I]]. Supported by the [[Safavid Empire]], Humayun returned to India. His son, [[Akbar]] the Great extended is power to northern India and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs.

Miniature paintings from the court of Akbar show that carpets were in use at the Mughal court. During the seventeenth century, commercial records prove the extensive trade in carpets with western Europe. Mughal carpets were depicted in period Netherlandish paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ydema|first1=Onno|title=Carpets and their datings in Netherlandish paintings : 1540-1700|date=1991|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1851491513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large number of Indian carpets still exist in European collections.

The majority of Mughal period carpets shows floral motifs, large leaf-and-blossom patterns, on a red field. Depending on their similarities with, e.g., Persian carpet designs, they are sometimes leballed “Indo-Persian”, or “Indo-Isfahan” in the literature. A large collection of Indian carpets existed at [[Jaipur]], where they were studied by T. H. Hendley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendley|first1=T.H.|title=Asian Carpets: XVI and XVII century designs from the Jaipur palaces|date=1905|publisher=W. Griggs|location=London|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these rugs were labeled, indicating the date of purchase, size, and cost. Most carpets in Jaipur had a cotton foundation, silk was sometimes used for the wefts. White cotton was used for accents in the pile. The finest carpets are often labelled as Persian, but there are carpets with an animal design which are labelled as Indian. The field is frequently dyed with lac, an insect dye resembling cochineal dye. A series of palmettes is often seen along the central vertical axis. On larger carpets, they are flanked by horizontal palmettes pointing alternately to the central axis and to the outer edges. Subsidiary figures are arranged along thin lines of scrolling vinework, usually adorned with lancet-shaped leaves. Several shades of blue are often seen, green, yellow, two different shades of red. Frequently two shades of the same colour are placed closely together with no outlining between the two colours. This feature is regarded as characteristic for Mughal Indian carpets.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The floral design of Indian carpets is often more naturalistic than in their Persian and other counterparts. This feature is considered typical for carpets woven under [[Jahangir]]. Another typical design is the "millefleurs" design, woven mainly between the seventeenth and nineteenth century. These rugs are very intricately woven, with soft wool and often with silk warps which change their colours across the width of the rug, forming vertical “rainbow” bands across the carpet. The field is covered by a multitude of fine flowerheads connected by fine vinework. Carpets with prayer rug design show elaborate vase-and-flowers arrangements flanked by cypress trees, another feature of Mughal art, also seen in architectural ornaments of Mughal period buildings like the [[Taj Mahal]]. Exact dating of Mughal period carpets is difficult, since few examples have inwoven dates. Rugs were woven in [[Agra]], [[Lahore]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

With the decline of the Mughal Empire, by the late nineteenth century, carpet weaving in India had also declined to an extent that the [[British Raj|British]] colonial administration decided to set up factories, sometimes in jails, to produce carpets for export. Carpet weaving continues in India and Pakistan after their separation and independence. Today, the carpet production in India and Pakistan frequently use foreign designs or design copies, and produce commercial rugs of mainly utilitarian value.

== The Oriental rug and the Western world ==
Oriental rugs were probably known to Europe since the [[High Middle Ages]]. Travellers' stories, court annals, home inventories and testaments and, most importantly, paintings bear evidence of rugs and carpets as goods of luxury. As such, they were absorbed into European material culture, providing a context of prestige and dignity which is still understood today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Persian Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, art historic and scientific interest in oriental rugs awoke, and they began to be regarded as genuine objects of art. Rugs were collected in museums and by private collectors, and provided the material for scientific research. Nearly every aspect of the manufacture, design, colours, and cultural significance has been, and still is, analyzed and appreciated.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the [[The Travels of Marco Polo|account of his travels]] about Anatolian rugs. Other thirteenth-century European [[Travel Literature|travellers]] who journeyed to the court of the [[Mongol Empire]] were [[André de Longjumeau]], [[William of Rubruck]] and [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] with [[Benedykt Polak]]. None of them visited China except Marco Polo. The Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] travelled with the [[Golden Horde]] and through China in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century English author [[John de Mandeville]] wrote an account of his journeys in the East. The travellers sometimes cursorily mention carpets, but only the luxurious carpets which they saw at royal courts seem to have attracted greater interest.

By the late twelfth century, the [[Republic of Venice]], strategically positioned at the head of the Adriatic, became a flourishing trade center. In 1204, [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]], led the Venetian contingent in the [[Fourth Crusade]] which ended in the [[Sack of Constantinople]], and established Venetian predominance in the trade between western Europe and the [[Islamic world]]. Occasional reports appear about carpets and rugs being bought in Venice. In a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Renaissance]] painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] mentions "two nice and large" carpets which he bought for a friend amongst other luxury goods. Objects of courtly representation and prestige initially, oriental rugs became affordable to wider groups of European citizens with the growing wealth and influence of merchant families and private persons. Inventories and testaments of Venetian citizens found in the archives document extensive collection of carpets.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|editor1-last=Carboni|editor1-first=Stefano|title=Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300124309|pages=175–191|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental rugs are depicted in a large number of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, attempts were made to determine the date when specific rugs were woven, and carpets were identified with designs similar to these reproduced in the paintings. As a rug could not have been woven later than it had appeared in a painting, the age of a carpet can be assessed by this ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra. C. G. Ellis, 1970|date=1985|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=München|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|pages=48–51|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists who established the method soon realized that their approach was biased, as it focused on representative carpets. Only these were deemed worthy of being reproduced by artists.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Village or nomadic rugs were not depicted in paintings aiming to represent dignity and prestige, and not until the mid twentieth century was their artistic and art historic value appreciated in the Western World.

=== Collectors and scientists: late nineteenth century until today ===

In the late nineteenth century, western art historians developed scientifically productive approaches to the Oriental rug.  In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets, because Oriental carpets were not yet collected when he wrote his book, and he thought that not many ancient carpets had survived. However, Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting of oriental rugs as an art form began in the 1880s.  It was confirmed by two groundbreaking exhibitions. The first took place in Vienna in 1891, focusing on the rugs of the imperial collection of the [[House of Habsburg]], but including specimen from private collections as well.&lt;ref name="1891 Vienna exhibition catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=K. K. Österreichisches Handelsmuseum Wien (Ed.)|title=Katalog der Ausstellung Orientalischer Teppiche im K. K. Österreichischen Handelsmuseum|date=1891|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second was held in London in 1892. For the first time, the [[Ardabil Carpet]] was presented to the public.&lt;ref name="Ardabil carpet, first publication"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbing|first1=Edward Percy|title=The holy carpet of the mosque at Ardebil|date=1892|publisher=Robson &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), advised by [[William Morris]], purchased the Ardabil carpet, recognised today as one of the finest carpets in the world. The high price that was to be paid for the Ardabil carpet required public collection of money, and Oriental rugs came to be understood as objects of great value by a larger audience.

In 1882, Robinson published a book on eastern carpets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Vincent J.|title=Eastern Carpets: Twelve Early Examples with descriptive notices|date=1882|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he deployed the analytical terms that were emerging in decorative arts scholarship for the elements of carpet design, recognising medallions, floral tracery, cloud bands or the “so-called cloud pattern”, and scrollwork on the outer border.

In 1891, [[Alois Riegl]] published his book about “Ancient Oriental Carpets”.&lt;ref name="Riegl, Ancient oriental carpets, 1892"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riegl|first1=Alois|title=Altorientalische Teppiche|date=1892|publisher=A. Th. Engelhardt|isbn=3-88219-090-6|edition=Reprint 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Oriental carpets were analyzed in their geographic, cultural, and sociological context, which marks the first time when Oriental rugs were recognized as an art in itself. Following a first essay in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Ein altpersischer Teppich im Besitz der Königlichen Museen zu Berlin|journal=Jahrbuch der königlich preussischen Kunstsammlungen, Berlin|date=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Wilhelm von Bode]] published his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr. C. G. Ellis, 1970|date=1985|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=München|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|pages=48–51|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still is considered as a standard textbook. Wilhelm von Bode's donation of his carpet collection to the Berlin Museum in 1904-5 was the foundation of the Islamic Museum, Berlin, today the [[Pergamon Museum]]. With Wilhelm von Bode as its first director, his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] created and established the “Berlin School” of history of Islamic Art. They developed the ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method for dating based on Renaissance paintings, recognized the “four social layers” of carpet production (nomadic, village, town and court manufacture) with their different approaches to design and stylization, and established the method of structural analysis to determine the historical framework of the rug weaving traditions within the Islamic world, from a Western perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K. Erdmann|date=1977|publisher=Oguz Pr.|location=London|isbn=9780905820026|edition=1977 English ed. of the original, 1957 German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London 1892 exhibition, especially the display of the Ardabil carpet, led to a growing interest in collecting oriental rugs by private collectors, who, mainly in the United States, also started publicly exhibiting their collections. Later on, private collectors donated their collections to museums. U.S. American collectors and philanthropists ([[Charles Yerkes|Charles T. Yerkes]], [[J. P. Morgan]], Joseph L. Williams, [[James F. Ballard]], [[Benjamin Altman]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[George Hewitt Myers|George H. Myers]] and Joseph V. McMullan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Joseph McMullan Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2011/islamic-art/joseph-mcmullan|website=Met Museum of Art|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) donated to, or bequeathed their collections to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. [[James F. Ballard]] donated both to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and to the St. Louis Art Museum. [[George Hewitt Myers]] donated his private collection to found the Textile Museum, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farnham|first1=Thomas J.|title=In pursuit of high standards|journal=Hali|date=2015|volume=Summer 2015|issue=184|pages=52–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major exhibition of oriental rugs in the United States was held in Chicago in 1893. Further exhibitions include the Detroit Institute of Arts, 1922;&lt;ref name="Detroit Exhibition, 1921"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=Vincent D.|title=Loan exhibition of antique oriental rugs; arranged and catalogued for the Detroit institute of arts of the city of Detroit, by Mr. Vincent D.

Many of the dealers who set up booths at these exhibitions then started galleries in America’s major cities. In New York, most of these stores were run by Armenian immigrants and concentrated in lower and mid-town Manhattan. At the turn of the century, the best known stores belonged to [[Dikran Kelekian]], [[Hagop Kevorkian]], S. Kent Costikyan and H. Michaelyan. In 1932, a group of collectors and rug enthusiasts, amongst them Arthur Dilley, Joseph McMullan, and Maurice Dimand, then curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded the ''Hajji Baba Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hajji Baba Club, New York|url=http://www.hajjibaba.org|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their exhibitions and publications, they have contributed ever since to the knowledge and appreciation of oriental rugs.

'''Rice and Rasam''' (ಅನ್ನ ಸಾರು) is a 52&amp;nbsp;minutes documentary film produced by [[Rajiv Mehrotra]] of the PSBT ([[Public Service Broadcasting Trust]]) in the year 2012. It is directed by [[Ramchandra PN]], under a fellowship that is awarded by [[Public Service Broadcasting Trust|PSBT]] for the year 2011-2012. The film is about the nomadic life style of the artists of the professional theater troupes in Karnataka, South India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psbt.org/general/Fellowships PSBT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company Theater==
Influenced by the proscenium Parsi theater style, professional theater troupes were quite popular in the state of Karnataka during the 19th century. These theater troupes are commonly called as 'Company Theater'. The nomadic artists of the company theater move from one village to another, pitch tin sheet tents and stage plays. The best known exponent of this was the Gubbi Company, a theater troupe run by the legendary [[Gubbi Veeranna]]. But changing times has brought in a decline of these artists.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'By the year 1900, professional theater activity became institutionalized .These troupes staged plays periodically in many towns and cities and also during annual Jaatras and important festivals in different regions. With both the Maharaja and the public patronizing them more and more theater became a part and parcel of daily life. Initially the stage used to be lit with kerosene lamps and subsequently gaslights were used, to be replaced later by electric lights.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Source: Karnataka Varthe)&lt;ref&gt;[http://karnatakavarthe.org/a-glimpse-of-kannada-theatre Karnataka Varthe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film deals with the two troupes of professional theater artist Rajanna Jewargi as they struggle to adapt to times, remain relevant and survive. Gubbi Nagesh, a member of the erstwhile Gubbi Company, his wife Gubbu Manjula, son Prashant Gubbi, daughter Sweta Gubbi are also part of this entourage. The film shows the dismantling and reconstruction of the theater; and the condition in which the artists live.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'While Rice and Rasam of 52 minute duration deals with the quotidian daily routines, struggles, mediocrity, conflicts and joy, it simultaneously is critical of rapidly changing scenario of economic decline in Gubbi Theater.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Source: Pradip Biswas)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thescape.in/news/20120914/OPEN-FORUM-FESTIVAL-2012-A-BENCHMARK-PHENOMENON/3581 Pradip Biswas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
At one point of time when the company theater was at its glory, Companies success were judged by the number of messes that they had and the number of items that they served. But the modern day companies gives its employees only Rice and Rasam, the staple diet of Karnataka. Anything else, the employees will have to either cook themselves or buy it from outside. Hence the name of the film is Rice and Rasam.

==Production==
The film has been shot in various locations in the Southern State of Karnataka in  India - in villages like Jewargi, Kudithini, Mannur and Kukanur - spread over a period of a year during the period 2011–2012.

==Crew==
While the film has been photographed, editing and directed by [[Ramchandra PN]], location sound is by Santosh Kumar and Sound Designer and Sound Editing is by Mohandas VP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonkfilms.com/Rice-Rasam.htm Sonk Films]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Festival Participation==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Sage writing''' was a [[genre]] of [[creative nonfiction]] popular in the [[Victorian era]]. The concept originates with John Holloway's 1953 book ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.''

Sage writing is a development from ancient [[wisdom literature]] in which the writer chastises and instructs the reader about contemporary social issues, often utilizing discourses of [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[politics]], and [[economics]] in non-technical ways. Prominent examples of the genre include writings by [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[John Ruskin]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Some 20th-century writers, such as [[Joan Didion]] and [[New Journalism|New Journalists]] such as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Tom Wolfe]], have also been identified as sage writers.

==Characteristic traits==
Holloway constructed the concept as a means to rediscover the value of Victorian writers who had been denigrated by Modernists for their prolixity and moralizing. He wrote "No one, of course, is suggesting that Victorian 'prophetic' literature is an all-sufficing treasury of forgotten wisdom. But by now we can see that the Victorian prophets deserve not embarrassed disregard but respect and thoughtful attention."&lt;ref name = "holl"&gt;Holloway, John. ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.'' London: Macmillan, 1953, p. 2; p22&lt;/ref&gt;

Holloway identified Thomas Carlyle as the originator of the genre, but traced its origins back to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. He argued that Carlyle "wants to state, and to clinch, the basic tenets of a 'Life-Philosophy', of something that will veritably transform men's outlook".&lt;ref name = "holl"/&gt; Carlyle established a model whereby the writer makes non-logical arguments about contemporary social issues, drawing from various forms of modern knowledge and traditional wisdom.

According to [[George Landow (professor)|George Landow]], who developed Holloway's model, sage writing can be distinguished from traditional [[wisdom literature]] in that "Whereas the pronouncements of traditional wisdom literature always take as their point of departure the assumption that they embody the accepted, [[received wisdom]] of an entire society, the pronouncements of the biblical prophet and Victorian sage begin with the assumption that, however traditional their messages may once have been, they are now forgotten or actively opposed by society."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Sage versus the Wisdom Speaker."&lt;/ref&gt; The sage borrows from the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s what Landow identifies as a four-part strategy of "interpretation, attack upon the audience (or those in authority), warning, and visionary promise."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Prophet's Four-Part Pattern."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Sage writing is a development of [[wisdom literature]] drawing much of its energy from the style of [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s such as [[Jeremiah]] and [[Isaiah]]; notably, sage writer [[Matthew Arnold]] was once referred to as an "Elegant [[Jeremiah]]".&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Landow also lists [[sermon]] writing, [[satire]], and British and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romantic poetry]] as formative influences.

==Major Sage Texts==
* [[Thomas Carlyle]] - "Signs of the Times" (1829); ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' (1843); ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]]'' (1850)
* [[Matthew Arnold]] - ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869)
* [[John Ruskin]] - ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1851-3); ''[[Unto this Last]]'' (1860)
* [[Henry David Thoreau]] -  ''[[Life Without Principle]]''; (1854); ''[[Slavery in Massachusetts]]'' (1854); ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'' (1859)

The '''Salon de Mai''' (the ''[[salon (gathering)|May Salon]]'') is a group of French artists which formed in a café on the Rue Dauphine in [[Paris]] in 1943 during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrier, Jean-Louis. (Ed.) (1999) ''Art of the 20th Century''. Paris: Chene-Hachette, p. 431. {{ISBN|2842772210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the Salon de Mai was founded as an Association (declared in 1944) in opposition to [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology and its condemnation of [[degenerate art]].  It founder members were the art critic [[Gaston Diehl]] and the painters, sculptors and engravers [[Henri-Georges Adam]], [[Emmanuel Auricoste]], [[Lucien Coutaud]], [[Robert Couturier (sculptor)|Robert Couturier]], [[Jacques Despierre]] (who suggested naming the salon after the month in which its first meetings were held), [[Marcel Gili]], [[Léon Gischia]], [[Francis Gruber]], [[Jean Le Moal]], [[Alfred Manessier]], [[André Marchand (painter)|André Marchand]], [[Edouard Pignon]], [[Gustave Singier]], [[Claude Venard]] and [[Roger Vieillard]], who together formed it direction committee. Several of them (Coutaud, Gischia, Le Moal, Manessier, Marchand, [[ORAZI]], Pignon, Singier) participated in the 1941 exhibition {{Interlanguage link multi|Vingt jeunes peintres de tradition française|fr}}.

Under its president [[Gaston Diehl]] the first Salon de Mai exhibition took place in the galerie Pierre Maurs (3, avenue Matignon) from 29 May to 29 June 1945.  Its honorary committee was made up of [[Germain Bazin]], [[Jacques Dupont (director)|Jacques Dupont]], [[René Huyghe]], [[Bernard Dorival]], [[Michel Florisoone]], [[Pierre Ladoué]] and [[Marc Thiboutet]].  Its judging panel was headed by [[Jean Follain]].  The catalogue of this first Salon had a preface by Gaston Diehl, with texts by [[René Bertelé]] and [[André Rolland de Renéville]], poems by [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Lucien Becker]], [[André Frénaud]], [[Jean Follain]] and [[Eugène Guillevic|Guillevic]].
It was then organised at the 'Gallery Arts' in Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and later transferred with its rooms to the [['Musée d'art Moderne de la Ville de Paris']] (in the modern building of the former [['Palais des Musées d'Art Moderne']], then 'Palais de Tokyo'

Gaston Diehl was president of the Salon de Mai until 1997.

The '''Seated Buddha from Gandhara''' is an early statue of the [[Buddha]] discovered at the site of [[Jamal Garhi]] in ancient [[Gandhara]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]], that dates to the 2nd or 3rd century AD. It is now in room 33 of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/seated_buddha_from_gandhara.aspx Seated Buddha from Gandhara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020134252/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/seated_buddha_from_gandhara.aspx |date=20 October 2015 }}, [[British Museum]] Highlights, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of the "enlightened one" were not made until the 1st century CE, before that Buddha was represented by [[Aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic symbols such as his footprint]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;  Like other Gandharan, or [[Greco-Buddhist art]], the statue shows influence from [[Ancient Greek art]], as the region had been part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] established by [[Alexander the Great]].

==Description==
The statue was carved in [[schist]], allowing very fine detail, even down to showing the fingernails. The pose, which was to become one of a number of standard ones, shows Buddha as a teacher setting the wheel of [[Dharma]] in motion ([[Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand#Hand gestures|Dharmachakra Mudrā]]). Buddha did this following his enlightenment and after delivering his first sermon at the deer park at [[Sarnath]]&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; near [[Varanasi]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The statue was made in the 2nd or 3rd century and although Buddha lived in the 4th century before Christ this is still a quite early statue. Statues of the "enlightened one" were not made until the 1st century AD. For the first four hundred years after his death Buddha was represented by symbols alone such as his footprint.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lp9wEwU9RrC4De5WrDawtg Seated Buddha], History of the World in 100 Objects, BBC, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This statue was used as the inspiration of a [[BBC Radio 4]] programme in the series called ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'' in May 2010. The programme discussed the change that allowed Buddha to be represented by a statue instead of as previously by symbols alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00shk95 Seated Buddha from Gandhara], BBC Radio 4, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of the Buddha is shown on a cushion on a throne or platform.  On the front of the throne there are much smaller figures of a ''[[bodhisattva]]'' with a [[Peshawari pagri|turban]] and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], flanked by kneeling figures of a male and female probably representing [[donor portraits]] of a couple who paid for the statue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=225497&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=RRI5353&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 Collection database, British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shemahinskaya boyaderka 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A dancer from [[Shamakhi]]. [[Grigory Gagarin|G.Gagarin]], mid-19th century]]
The '''Shamakhi dancers''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Şamaxı rəqqasələri'') were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in [[Shamakhi]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to [[tawaif]]s.

[[Russia]]n painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] who lived in the [[Caucasus]] in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as ''bayaderki''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cultur/359/ Ими восхищался Дюма] by Emil Karimov and Mehpara Aliyeva. ''Azeri.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; (баядерки; sg. ''bayaderka'' – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term ''balliadera'' borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (''bayadère'') and initially used to refer to the [[devadasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayadère. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved February 1st, 2008 from Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in [[Arthur Gobineau|Comte de Gobineau]]'s novel ''The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales''.

''The Dancer of Shamakha'' recounts the life of Armenian dancer [[Armen Ohanian]], her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as ''La Danseuse de Shamakha'' in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by [[Rose Wilder]].  After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles.  She eventually moved to Mexico.  She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, Armen.  ''La Danseuse de Shamakha''.  Forward by Anatole France. Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1918

[[File:Raymon de Peñaforte.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond of Peñafort]] founded one of the first schools of the ''Studia Linguarum''.]]
The '''''Studia Linguarum''''' (literally "Language Institutes") were the first attempt to [[Oriental studies|study oriental languages]] by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}} The need to study oriental languages was affirmed by the General Chapter of the [[Dominican Order]] in [[Paris]] in 1236.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The objective of the schools was to help the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] liberate Christian captives in Islamic lands.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

==Description==
The first school of the ''Studia Linguarum'' was established in [[Tunis]] by [[Raymond of Peñafort]] in the early 13th century, where it was also designated as the ''Studium arabicum''.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}It is known that in 1250, the Provincial Chapter of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] sent 8 friars to the Tunis institute to study Arabic, including the famous Arabist [[Ramon Marti]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The school permitted some students to learn [[Arabic]] during the second half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

As a side effect of the establishment of these institutes, some Arabic scientific works were also translated in European languages, such as the ophthalmological work ''Liber Oculorum'' of [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal|Ali Ibn Isa]] (Jesu Haly) by Friar [[Dominicus Marrochini]] of the ''Studium'' of [[Murcia]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

In 1311, the [[Council of Vienne]] further decided to create schools for the study of oriental languages in the universities of [[Paris]], [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], [[Salamanca]] and [[Rome]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

The '''Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;3''', [[Opus number|Op]].&amp;nbsp;35, is an orchestral composition by the Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]], who wrote the piece from 1974–75 on commission from the [[Finnish Broadcasting Company]]. The [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]] premiered the work on 8&amp;nbsp;April 1975 in [[Helsinki]], under the direction of its principal conductor, [[Okko Kamu]]. The symphony was the first by Sallinen to depart from the single-movement structure he had utilized for his previous two essays in the form.

== Instrumentation ==
According to the publisher, [http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/7937 Novello &amp; Co], Symphony No. 3 is scored for the following:
*'''[[Woodwind section|Woodwind]]''': 4&amp;nbsp;[[flute]]s (2&amp;nbsp;doubling [[piccolo]]), 3&amp;nbsp;[[oboe]]s, 4&amp;nbsp;[[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} (1&amp;nbsp;doubling B{{music|flat}} [[bass clarinet]]), 3&amp;nbsp;[[bassoon]]s (1&amp;nbsp;doubling [[contrabassoon]])
*'''[[Brass section|Brass]]''': 4&amp;nbsp;[[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3&amp;nbsp;[[trumpet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, 3&amp;nbsp;[[trombone]]s, 1&amp;nbsp;[[tuba]]
*'''[[Percussion section|Percussion]]''': [[timpani]], 3&amp;nbsp;percussionists ([[bass drum]], [[snare drum]], small drum, [[tom-tom]]s, [[wood block]]s, [[tam-tam]], [[crotales]], [[cymbals]] [[glockenspiel]], [[vibraphone]], [[marimba]])
*'''[[String section|String]]s''': [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es, [[harp]], [[celesta]], [[piano]]

== Structure ==
The symphony is in three movements:
# Tempo energico ed sostenuto
# Chaconne
# Vivace giocoso — Finale

== Recordings ==
To date, Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;3 has received two recordings, the first of which is from 1975 with Okko Kamu conducting the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra on the [[BIS Records|BIS]] label. Finnish conductor [[:fi:Ari Rasilainen|Ari Rasilainen]] has also recorded the symphony as part of [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo's]] compendium of Sallinen's orchestral works. The Third Symphony joins the [[Symphony No. 5 (Sallinen)|Fifth]] (Op.&amp;nbsp;57, 1985) on the penultimate volume of the cpo series.

'''''Tales from the Secret Annex''''' is a collection of miscellaneous prose fiction and non-fiction  written by [[Anne Frank]] while she was in hiding during the [[The Netherlands in World War II|Nazi occupation of The Netherlands]]. It was first published in The Netherlands in 1949, then in an expanded edition in 1960. A complete edition appeared in 1982, and was later included in the 2003 publication of ''The Revised Critical Edition of The Diary of Anne Frank''.

A revised British edition was published in 2010 by Halban Publishers. 

Along with her posthumously published [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]], written in hiding between 1942 and 1944, Anne Frank wrote short stories, essays, personal recollections, and the first five chapters of a novel. The latter was written in the back half of one of her diary notebooks, while the short pieces were compiled into a journal begun on September 2, 1943. Entitled ''Verhaaltjes, en gebeurtenissen uit het Achterhuis beschreven door Anne Frank'' (''Stories and Sketches from the Backhouse described by Anne Frank''), it was recovered with her other manuscripts from her [[Anne Frank House|hiding place]] by [[Miep Gies]] and [[Bep Voskuijl]] following Anne Frank's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] on August 19, 1944.

The '''Fleming Collection''' is a large [[private collection]] of [[Scottish art]]. It was on display in a gallery in [[Berkeley Square]], central [[London]], England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flemingcollection.com/collection/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819021804/http://flemingcollection.com/collection | archivedate=19 August 2016 | title=History of the Collection | accessdate=30 December 2017 | publisher=Fleming Collection, UK | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the gallery's closure in 2016.

==Origins==
The collection was started in 1968 from the Scottish banking firm [[Robert Fleming &amp; Co.]], founded in [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]], [[Scotland]].  In 1968 the bank moved to a new building in Corsby Square in the City of London and it was decided to create a collection for the purpose of decorating the space.  This task was given singularly to one of the bank’s directors, David Donald.  The only guideline given was that the paintings should be by Scottish artists or Scottish scenes by any artists, to emphasise the bank's proud Scottish origins.  Scottish art was largely unknown outside Scotland until the 1980s, making prices relatively low, meaning that a large collection was amassed in a short amount of time.

David Donald died unexpectedly in 1985.  Earlier that year he was awarded the honour of being elected an Honorary Academician of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] for services to Scottish art.  The role of collector was continued by Robert Fleming and Bill Smith, who was later to become the first Keeper of Art.  Under his guidance the Collection was moved to its new headquarters in Copthall Avenue.  The Collection also began to focus more on collecting the work of living artists.  By the 1990s it had gained international recognition as a collection of Scottish art and as a corporate art collection.  After Bill Smith’s retirement, Selina Skipwith became the new Keeper of Art.

==The Fleming-Wyfold Foundation==

In March 2000 Flemings bank was sold to [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], New York.  To avoid the Collection being lost, the Fleming family put forward the funds to enable a new charitable foundation, The Fleming-Wyfold Foundation, to purchase the collection at market value before the sale.

The collection was moved to premises on Berkeley Street in 2002.  The gallery was to have a revolving exhibition based on works from the Collection and aiming to act as a showcase for Scottish art in London.  The Foundation also continues to lend works to exhibitions internationally.  In June 2010, a second gallery was opened within the premises to allow for a changing exhibition programme showing emerging and established Scottish artists as well as works from the collection.

In 2015 it was announced that the gallery would close in March 2016, and that the Foundation would instead focus on 'loans, exhibitions, and art education'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/14040453.Renowned_Fleming_Collection_gallery_of_Scottish_art_in_London_to_close/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works in the Collection==
The collection contains art from the mid 18th century to the present by a large selection of Scottish artists.
From the 18th and 19th centuries, artists include [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Henry Raeburn]], [[Jacob More]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], Scottish [[Impressionist]] [[William McTaggart]] and notable images of the [[Highland Clearances]], [[Thomas Faed]]’s ''The Last of The Clan'' and John Watson Nicol’s ''Lochaber No More''.

Key groups represented include [[The Glasgow Boys]], with works by [[Arthur Melville]], [[John Lavery]], [[Sir James Guthrie]], [[Edward Arthur Walton]], [[Joseph Crawhall]] and [[Edward Atkinson Hornel]].

The collection is particularly known for its works by the [[Scottish Colourists]], a group composed of [[Samuel John Peploe]], [[John Duncan Fergusson]], [[George Leslie Hunter]], and [[Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell]].

The collection includes works by 20th-century artists including [[James Cowie (artist)|James Cowie]], [[Stanley Cursiter]], [[Anne Redpath]], [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]], [[William George Gillies]], [[William Geissler]], [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], [[Alan Davie]], [[Joan Eardley]], [[Craigie Aitchison (painter)|Craigie Aitchison]], [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Will Maclean]], [[John Bellany]], [[Alison Watt (Scottish painter)|Alison Watt]], [[Jock McFadyen]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Skipwith (2003) ''A History of Scottish Art'' London: Merrell Publishers Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gallery of HMS 'Calcutta' (Portsmouth)''''', also known as '''''Officer and Ladies on Board HMS Calcutta''''', is an 1876 oil painting by [[James Tissot]].  It depicts two ladies in fashionable clothing and a young naval [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]], standing on the [[quarter gallery]] at the stern of the Royal Navy warship [[HMS Calcutta (1831)|HMS ''Calcutta'']].  The painting is held by the [[Tate Gallery]] in London and measures {{convert|68.6|x|91.8|cm}}.

==Background==
[[HMS Calcutta (1831)|HMS ''Calcutta'']] was an 84-gun [[second rate]] [[ship of the line]], built from [[teak]] in [[Bombay]] in 1831.  After a period in reserve, she was recommissioned in 1855 to serve in the Baltic in the [[Crimean War]], and then served in the [[Second Opium War]] in the Far East in 1856-8.  She was the British ship of the line to visit Japan in 1858.  She became a gunnery training ship in 1865, and by 1876 was alongside [[HMS Cambridge (1815)|HMS ''Cambridge'']] in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]].  Astern of the ''Calcutta'' was the [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]] of [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1810)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] which housed the navy's gunnery school, [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']].

Tissot was a French painter.  He left Paris after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and resided in London from 1871.  He knew [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Edgar Degas]], but turned away from [[Impressionism]],&lt;ref&gt;Paquette, Lucy. [https://thehammocknovel.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/tissots-brush-with-impressionism/ Tissot’s Brush with Impressionism]". Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  and made mainly portraits and [[genre painting]]s of the Victorian upper classes in a more polished [[academic art|academic]] style.

==Description==
The painting is typical of Tissot's work, depicting his subjects with almost photographic [[realism (arts)|realism]], with an ambiguous narrative that hints at risqué behaviour among the wealthy classes approaching or transgressing boundaries of propriety.  

Tissot's work depicts two women with a young man in a [[flirting|flirtatious]] situation, but with a dangerous sensual undercurrent of moral uncertainty.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;"[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tissot-the-gallery-of-hms-calcutta-portsmouth-n04847 ''The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Portsmouth)'', c.1876]". Tate. Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  The man is dressed plainly in the uniform of a junior naval officer.  Each woman is wearing a [[1870s in Western fashion|fashionable]] gauzy white dress decorated with bows and ribbons, with a tightly fitting bodice over a corset and full skirts below the hips .  

One woman, in a dress decorated with yellow ribbons, is leaning over the railing of the ship's [[quarter gallery]], turning her head away as she hides her face from the naval officer behind her [[hand fan|fan]].  In the [[European hand fans in the 18th century]] [[language of the fan]], an open fan over left ear indicates "do not betray our secret".  Her [[hourglass figure]]&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt; is echoed by the curves of the gallery's iron railings. Tissot's reference to HMS ''Calcutta'' may be making a punning on the French phrase "Quel cul tu as" ("What an arse you have").  Another woman in similar white dress with yellow ribbons appears in Tissot's 1876 painting ''Summer''. 

The second woman in the painting, wearing a dress with blue ribbons, may be a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], or possibly the officer's wife: he stands beside her, and wears a wedding ring, but he only has eyes for the first woman.  The overdressed woman have a touch of vulgarity.  The presence of others in the party is suggested by a line of chairs beside the windows of the gallery: perhaps they are sitting out a dance at a ball on board.  Several [[troop ship]]s are in the background, under smoky grey skies.  

Tissot pays attention to the details of the women's clothing and the ship's railings.  His realistic style takes its sense of colour and light from the Impressionists, but the asymmetric composition may be influenced by [[Japanese printmaking]]. 

Tissot made a [[drypoint]] version of the work in 1876, reproduced as an etching, {{convert|10.375|x|14.25|in|cm}}, with the subtitle ''Memory of a Ball on Board'' ("La Galerie du 'Calcutta' (Souvenir d'un bal à bord)").  It was printed in ''[[The Graphic]]'' magazine with the title "Souvenir of a Ball on Shipboard".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/37114/ The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Souvenir of a ball on shipboard)]". [[National Gallery of Victoria]].  Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Tissot's elegant depictions of passing fashions in sophisticated London society, with their ambiguous undercurrents, were criticised as immoral and superficial.  [[Oscar Wilde]] criticised Tissot and his "hard unscrupulousness in painting uninteresting objects in uninteresting ways".  [[Henry James]] contemptuously described ''The Gallery of HMS Calcutta'' as "hard, vulgar and banal".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2001), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  

The painting was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London in 1877, after it had been sold to Scottish painter [[John Robertson Reid]].  It was later sold to [[Henry Trengrouse]].  After his death, it was bought by the [[Leicester Galleries]] in London in 1929 for 16 guineas, and then sold to [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who donated it to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt;

'''''The Magic Circle''''' is an [[oil painting]] in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style, created in 1886 by [[John William Waterhouse]]. The painting depicts a [[witch]] or [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] drawing a fiery [[magic circle]] on the earth to create a ritual space.

==History==
''The Magic Circle'' was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=15985&amp;searchid=5475&amp;tabview=text|title=Tate - Website undergoing maintenance|publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after ''Consulting the Oracle'' and [[Saint Eulalia (Waterhouse painting)|''St. Eulalia'']], was Waterhouse's third exhibit with a supernatural theme in as many years.&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5210397|title=John William Waterhouse, R.A. (1848-1917)|author=Christie's|publisher=christies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was well received at its exhibition,&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt; and was purchased for £650 the same year by the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]], through the [[Francis Legatt Chantrey|Chantrey Bequest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/magic-circle-1886|title=J. W. Waterhouse|publisher=johnwilliamwaterhouse.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109040759/http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/magic-circle-1886|archivedate=9 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was extremely successful with the critics and public alike.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Description==
In a style typical of Waterhouse, the main character is a lone, female figure, placed centrally on the canvas. The surrounding landscape is hazy, as though it is not quite real, and the background figures are only discernible on close inspection, deliberately ensuring the witch is the only image of importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=15985&amp;searchid=9821&amp;tabview=text|title=Tate - Website undergoing maintenance|publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterhouse paid careful attention to the angles employed in this work, balancing the circle the figure is drawing around herself by the use of a triangle – her straight arm, extended by the straight stick, held out at 25 degrees to her erect body. The witch's power is emphasised by the determined face, by her exclusion of the ravens and frog – popular symbols representing magic – and by her command over the smoke pillar. Instead of billowing outwards or being affected by the wind, it remains in a straight line. A live snake [[ouroboros]] loops around the woman's neck.

[[Image:Miranda - The Tempest JWW.jpg|thumb|''Miranda'' by J. W. Waterhouse (1916)]]

''The Magic Circle'' is similar in composition to Waterhouse's later picture, ''Miranda'' (1916), also a woman associated with magic. The witch wears a similar dress to ''Miranda'' and her face can also only be seen in profile. Unlike [[Frederick Sandys]]' portrayals of sorceresses, such as his ''[[Medea (Sandys painting)|Medea]]'' (1868) or ''[[Morgan le Fay]]'' (1864), Waterhouse chose to make his witch's face intent and intriguing, as opposed to malevolent.

==Themes==
Miracles, magic and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as ''Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysees'' (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and ''Hylas and the Nymphs'' (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of middle-eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J.F Lewis (1805–76) and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1836–1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works, and reflects his fascination with the exotic.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The woman in this picture appears to be a witch or priestess, endowed with magic powers, possibly the power of prophecy. Her dress and general appearance is highly eclectic, and is derived from several sources: she has the swarthy complexion of a woman of middle-eastern origin; her hairstyle is like that of an early Anglo-Saxon; her dress is decorated with Persian or Greek warriors. In her left hand she holds a crescent-shaped sickle, linking her with the moon and [[Hecate]]. With the wand in her right hand she draws a protective [[magic circle]] round her. Outside the circle the landscape is bare and barren; a group of rooks or ravens and a frog – all symbols of evil and associated with witchcraft – are excluded. But within its confines are flowers and the woman herself, objects of beauty.&lt;br&gt;
The meaning of the picture is unclear, but its mystery and exoticism struck a chord with contemporary observers. When the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1886 the critic for the ''Magazine of Art'' wrote 'Mr Waterhouse, in ''The Magic Circle'', is still at his best – original in conception and pictorial in his results' (quoted in Hobson, p.37)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-magic-circle-n01572/text-summary|title=The Magic Circle, John William Waterhouse: Summary - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The Prince Eugen Culture Prize''' is named after the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugén]] (1865&amp;ndash;1947),who had a close connection to [[Norway]] and dedicated his life to strengthen the Swedish-Norwegian relations.

Through his position as royalty, the artistic prince was well-connected to the Norwegian public and cultural life, which he carefully followed while giving support to young artists. He was also involved in the Norwegian and Swedish musical scene and was a member of the committee of the construction of Stockholm Concert Hall. He was well known in the Scandinavian literature circles, and was an active reader of fiction, history and politics.

The Prince Eugen Culture Prize was founded to celebrate the 100 year mark of the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905 after an initiative from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Stockholm, in cooperation with Crown Princess Märtha's Church Council in Stockholm and Princess Märtha Louise's Culture Fund. The Prince Eugen Culture Prize is awarded to one Norwegian and one Swedish artist who through their work have contributed to strengthen Swedish-Norwegian relations. The award consists of a diploma and 50 000 Swedish crowns.

Through the years, the award has been presented by [[Queen Sonja of Norway]], [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Crown Princess Victoria]] and [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland|Princess Madeleine of Sweden]].

'''Tombs of the Sanhedrin''' ({{lang-he-n|קברי הסנהדרין}}, ''Kivrei HaSanhedrin''), also called '''Tombs of the Judges''', is an underground complex of 63 [[Rock-cut tombs in Israel|rock-cut tombs]] located in a public park in the northern [[Jerusalem]] neighborhood of [[Sanhedria]]. Constructed in the 1st century A.D., the tombs are noted for their elaborate design and symmetry. They have been a site for Jewish pilgrimage since the medieval period.

==Name==
The Tombs of the Sanhedrin have been known by different names among Jews and Christians. In 1235 Rabbi Jacob the Emissary called them the "Tombs of the Righteous", writing that the tombs housed the remains of "many wise men".&lt;ref name=jlife&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jlifeguides.com/en/sights/other/tombs-of-the-sanhedrin-13528/view-details.html|title=Tombs of the Sanhedrin |publisher=JLife |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first called the Tombs of the Sanhedrin by Rabbi Joseph Halevi in 1450,&lt;ref name=jlife/&gt; and have been known by that name among Jews ever since.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt;

In Christian literature, Joannes Cotovicus mentioned the tombs, without naming them, in 1598.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1611 English traveler [[George Sandys]] called them the "Tombs of the Prophets".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; They were named "Tombs of the Judges" &amp;ndash; referring to the "judges" of the [[Sanhedrin|Great Sanhedrin]] &amp;ndash; by [[Franciscus Quaresmius]] in the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; This is the name they are known by among non-Jews.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt;&lt;ref name=muni/&gt;

[[File:Sanhedrin1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An 1893 encyclopedia illustration of the [[Sanhedrin]] in session.]]
In the absence of identifying plaques or other indications as to the ownership of the tomb, historians speculate that the name "Tombs of the Sanhedrin" was applied because the tombs contain nearly as many burial niches as the number of members (71 to 73) of the [[Sanhedrin]], the Jewish Supreme Court in the era of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=cotton&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MK_spizMQwC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=tomb+of+the+sanhedrin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=seJ7KD9qJp&amp;sig=J7QKQlnkyrTyq1tP5EzzUb4N8qs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ev91UMiOI8Or0QWc7oDgCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20the%20sanhedrin&amp;f=false "Sanhedriya &amp;ndash; 'Tomb of the Judges' or 'Tomb of the Sanhedrin'"], in ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae'', Volume 1: Jerusalem, Part 1, 1-704. Cotton, Hannah M. et al, eds. 2010: Walter de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3110222205}}, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many archeologists refute this correlation.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eDxQk0MjhcC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tombs+bodies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IgpSzxe_Cu&amp;sig=EE91s1cSdIiB718vP6eQvj_jL9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_eCCUKebOvKb1AWmhYDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20tombs%20bodies&amp;f=false |title=The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described |volume=1|first=John |last=Wilson |publisher=White |year=1847 |page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james/&gt; In ''Durchs Heilige Land'' ([[Basel]], 1878), a journal of travel in the Holy Land, Swiss theologian [[Hans Konrad von Orelli]] said he believed that the Tombs of the Sanhedrin and the [[Tombs of the Kings (Jerusalem)|Tombs of the Kings]] (''Kivrei HaMelakhim'') were not necessarily connected to the names people associated with them.&lt;ref name=Arieh39/&gt; Instead, this could have been a burial cave for a wealthy Jewish family.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3&gt;"Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three, L. Y. Rahmani, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 45, No. 1 (Winter, 1982), pp. 43&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tombs of the Sanhedrin have been a site for Jewish pilgrimage and prayer since the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=bhol/&gt; Since medieval times, Jews considered the tombs holy and would not pass by them without stopping to pray there.&lt;ref name=Arieh39&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Arieh |first=Yehoshua |script-title=he:עיר בראי תקופה: ירושלים החדשה בראשיתה|trans-title=A City Reflected in its Times: New Jerusalem&amp;nbsp;– The Beginnings |language=Hebrew|publisher=Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi Publications |location=Jerusalem |year=1979|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1800s, the tombs were demarcated by a huge boulder that guided pilgrims to the site.&lt;ref name=Arieh38&gt;Ben Arieh (1979), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sanhedrin tombs 2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Forecourt and outer entrance to the Tombs of the Sanhedrin.]]
The tombs were constructed on the site of an ancient [[quarry]], with a forecourt at one end and the burial caves excavated out of the other end. The forecourt has benches hewn out of the rock for the benefit of visitors. The forecourt opens onto a small courtyard, walled on three sides.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; An elaborately carved Grecian&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2diqr_IIm8sC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=tombs+of+the+judges&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W55k18y-D5&amp;sig=0eScICBLg1ufg0ziKxFUCuCoV7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jrl5UN3oLYKt0QWD24HwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tombs%20of%20the%20judges&amp;f=false |pages=186&amp;ndash;187 |title=The City of the Great King |first=James Turner |last=Barclay |year=1858 |publisher=Arno Press|isbn= 0405102259}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pediment]] above the large, square entrance is decorated with plant motifs, including [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] entwined with [[pomegranate]]s and [[Ficus|figs]], representative of [[Judeo-Hellenistic]] burial art of the 1st century.&lt;ref name=golden&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z2cFY9iGqgC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tomb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNlYD2A71w&amp;sig=DeCa31FtmXW4wqYGCYPqYy1Kpak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=abN5ULrUMYO40QXB5ICgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20tomb&amp;f=false |pages=107&amp;ndash;108 |title=Golden Jerusalem |first=Menashe |last=Har-El |publisher=Gefen Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=9652292540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner entrance to the tombs is topped by a small pediment&lt;ref name=jerome&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT139&amp;lpg=PT139&amp;dq=sanhedrin+tomb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hu7xYxVDN3&amp;sig=MRoCK3LgdC9SLg8kyamYZhS6zjc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yax5UJ7THIb80QWv_oBo&amp;redir_esc=y |page=139 |title=The Holy Land:An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |first=Jerome |last=Murphy-O'Connor|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0191647667}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally sealed by a stone door.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt;

The facade of the tomb appeared differently in medieval times. One report describes a "beautiful structure" containing "caves within caves". A 1659 drawing shows an entrance with a grand, arched [[colonnade]].&lt;ref name=jerome/&gt;

[[File:Sanhedrin inside.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Burial niches in the main chamber.]]
Inside are four burial chambers on two levels.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt; The largest chamber, just inside the entrance, contains 13 arched [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]] (burial niches) arranged on two tiers,&lt;ref name=james/&gt; one atop the other, with [[arcosolia]] dividing the niches into pairs.&lt;ref name=jerome/&gt; Each niche measures {{convert|50|cm}} by {{convert|60|cm}}.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; A further 9 burial niches are located in a second chamber off the first, and 10 to 12 more niches can be found below-stairs from the main chamber in a chamber on the second level.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; A fourth chamber on a third level appears as an independent entity with its own entryway.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; The burial niches are arranged differently in each chamber, although each chamber is designed with an eye to [[symmetry]].&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; Stone [[ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in rock-cut vaults within the complex.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; All told, there are 63 burial niches in the tomb, along with several cubicles and niches for bone collection.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt;

In his 1847 book, ''The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described'', English archeologist John Wilson describes his exploration of the Tombs of the Sanhedrin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From the [[Tomb of Simeon the Just]], I proceeded further on, to the Tombs of the Sanhedrin. These, like the former, are under ground, hewn in the solid rock. The entrance here is still lower, and I was obliged, in some parts, to lay flat down and slide in; but when once inside, I found large vaulted chambers. I counted sixty-three niches where sarcophagi had formerly been placed. In each of these three tombs there were numberless names written on the walls by devout Jews who had visited them".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opinions differ as to how the bodies were placed in the niches. According to Har-El, Jews placed their deceased either in stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in the niches or in ossuaries in vaults.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; Williams and Willis quote an archeologist who opines that the bodies, swathed in burial clothes, were placed directly into the niches, which were then closed or sealed with a stone slab.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-o7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA152|pages=152&amp;ndash;156 |title=The Holy City: Historical, Topographical and Antiquarian Notices of Jerusalem, Volume 2 |first1=George |last1=Williams |authorlink1=George Williams (priest) |first2=Robert |last2=Willis |year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 a French archeologist investigating the tombs discovered a sarcophagus inscribed with the name ''Yitzchak'' (Isaac) in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Over the protests of local Jewish residents, the archeologist took the sarcophagus back with him to France, where it was displayed in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref name=muni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/openTable.asp?src=/jer_sys/tour/vir_tour/show/results_heb.asp?Tour_Spons=4&amp;cont=510 |script-title=he:קברי הסנהדרין|language=Hebrew |trans-title=Tombs of the Sanhedrin |publisher=Jerusalem Municipality |year=2008 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day==
Following the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem was captured by the Arab Legion and was only reconquered by the Israelis in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967. Throughout that 19-year period, many ancient graves were off-limits to Jewish visitors, and the Tombs of the Sanhedrin became an oft-visited site as a result.&lt;ref name=muni/&gt;

Through the 20th century, the tombs were open to the public. In the 1930s, a young [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]] claimed he found ancient coins in the caves and sold them to support himself after his father threw him out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-man-of-good-fortune-1.71559 |title=A Man of Good Fortune |date=10 October 2001 |accessdate=10 October 2012 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, access to the Tombs was restricted due to vandalism and a gate was placed across the entrance.

In the 1950s the State of Israel issued a [[Israeli lira|half-lira]] banknote that depicted the facade of the tombs.&lt;ref name=muni/&gt;
