Adaptive Physical Education (APE) is a physical education program that accommodates the needs of students with disabilities, that may include or be a combination of mobility or physical impairments, sensory impairments, intellectual disabilities, emotional or behavioural disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and Physical Education: Rationale - The Australian Curriculum v7.5|url = http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/rationale|website = www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greenwood Dictionary of Education (2nd Edition)|last = Collins|first = J.W.|publisher = Praeger|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Westport, CT|pages = |url = http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au|last2 = O'Brien|first2 = N.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical education is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone, regardless of disabilities or not. APE programs are vital in maintaining and enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities.

Australia’s physical education curriculum for adaptive students is currently the same as students without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Australian education institutions are required by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] and the [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] to instruct physical education to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Adaptive physical education evolved from medical treatments that were designed to cope with disabilities. In 1838, [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins School]] located in Boston, Massachusetts, an educational institute for visually impaired students, began introducing physical education programs for their students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adapted Physical Education and Sport|last = Winnick|first = J.P.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780736089180|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, the [[Ohio School for the Deaf|Ohio school for the Deaf]] instituted organised sports into the school for their students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Pehr Henrik Ling]], who founded the [http://www.gih.se/in-english/ Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences] in 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gih.se/in-english/|title = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences: In English|date = |accessdate = |website = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed medical gymnastic programs for people with disabilities in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Legislation ==
The legislation for the APE in Australia is as follows:
* [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] provides protection against any person that is discriminated against because of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/dda-guide-whats-it-all-about|title = D.D.A guide: What's it all about|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Human Rights Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] defines the responsibilities of educational institutions for students with disabilities. It also ensures that students with disabilities have access and are engaging in education on the same basis as students without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education|title = Disability Standards for Education|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Government Department of Education and Training|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impairments and Disabilities ==

=== Mobility or Physical Impairments ===

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affects a person's motor control areas in the brain that hinders their ability to move. It can affect one or more body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/what-is-cerebral-palsy/|title = What is cerebral palsy?|date = |accessdate = |website = Cerebral Palsy Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Brain Injury.jpg|thumb|Brain Injury]] --&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Brain injuries are injuries that diminish or impair physical, cognitive, social, behaviour or emotional functions of a person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Spinal cord disabilities are damage to the vertebrae or nerves of the spinal column resulting from disease or injury. Spinal cord injuries are generally associated with a degree of [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central nervous system (CNS) Disabilities ====
* Muscular, joint, and CNS disabilities are generally progressive and degenerative diseases. They can cause atrophied muscles, reduce motor skills, shorten range of motion and hinder the ability to perform physical activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Muscular dystrophy]] is a genetically inherited disease characterised by a progressive spread of weakness through various muscle groups or motor neurones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mda.org.au/Disorders/Overview.asp|title = What are muscular dystrophies and neuromuscular conditions?|date = |accessdate = |website = Muscular Dystrophy Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Visual impairments as defined by the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] (RIDBC) as a limitation to one or more functions of the eye or visual systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ridbc.org.au/blindness|title = Vision|date = |accessdate = |website = The Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Deaf is severe or profound hearing loss that causes insufficient comprehension of auditory information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* The [http://www.deafblind.org.au Australia Deafblind Council] (ADBC) defines deafblindness as an isolated sensory disability that results in a combination of loss to both vision and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deafblind.org.au|title = What is deafblindness?|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Deafblind Council|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional, Developmental and Behavioural Disorders ===
* Intellectual disabilities are defined, by the [http://aaidd.org American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)], as a serious impediment of intellectual functioning and the ability to adapt behaviour in both social and practical skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition#.VeV4D85UTsk|title = Definition of Intellectual Disability|date = |accessdate = |website = American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]] is a genetic condition that causes developmental, intellectual and physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx?hkey=8593b017-ec7a-47f1-b949-e7e9801b4c39|title = What is Down Syndrome?|date = |accessdate = |website = Down Syndrome Victoria|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emotional and behavioural disorders are generally labeled as having disruptive hyperactive, distracting, withdrawn and/or impetuous behaviour tendencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These emotional and behavioural disorders can hinder and negatively affect a student's educational capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s are developmental disabilities that affect how persons interact with their environment and the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/what-autism|title = What is Autism|date = |accessdate = |website = Autism Spectrum|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disability Specific Guidelines for Instruction of APE ===
Impairments and disabilities for APE students can vary or may even coexist with more than one disability. A students physical capabilities in APE will depend on their impairment or disability. These impairments and/or disabilities need to be addressed in the design of the students APE curriculum by their teachers or instructors of APE to ensure that the student is receiving the most beneficial physical educational program.

=== Mobility Impairments ===
[[File:ParalympicsGB preparing for their 7-a-side game (9375546563).jpg|thumb|People with Cerebral Palsy competing in the Paralympic Games]]

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Students with cerebral palsy should carryout moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength and flexibility training should be focused on maintaining a balance between flexor and extensor muscles. Motor coordination for students with cerebral palsy can be difficult, so balance and body coordination should be integrated into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Students of APE that have sustained brain injuries will commonly display balance problems and weak muscle movement. These students need to maintain moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength training should be integrated to improve muscle weakness and motor control skills may need to be relearned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Depending on the type of spinal cord disability that a student displays, will determine the type activities that are included in their APE program. Regardless of their spinal cord disability, these students need to engage in APE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central Nervous System (CNS) disabilities ====
* Students that have muscular, joint, or CNS disabilities need to engage in strength training and endurance activities for as long as capably possible, due to the progressive nature of these disabilities. The APE teacher should ensure that an adequate warm-up and cool-down focusing on flexibility are performed by the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Students with visual impairments have the capabilities to perform all the same physical activities as students without these impairments. However, due to lack or loss of vision, adaptations to some physical activities will need to be made for these students. Depending on the extent of their impairment, APE teachers can introduce bright colours balls or use audial cues to direct the students in physical activities. APE programs for these students should include open sports where there are changing variables, and closed sports where the activity is consistent and predictable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Students that are deaf have no limitations to their physical capabilities. However, communication skills will need to be adapted for their impairment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* Students that have deafblindness have the ability to perform same physical activities as students without deafblindness. However, due to their impairment, adaptations that are used for blind and deaf students will need to be implemented into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional and Behavioural Disorders ===
Students with intellectual disabilities need to have APE programs that are appropriately designed and take into consideration their academic, physical, motor, social and emotional skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students with emotional and behavioural disorders can create instructional dilemmas for APE teachers. Ideas for managing and instructing APE to these students are to have interpersonal communication, active listening, verbal mediation and conflict resolution schemes incorporated into the students physical education program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:JBLM hosts Special Olympics 140530-A-QM563-008.jpg|thumb|Down Syndrome students competing in Special Olympics]]

==== Down Syndrome ====
* Students with Down Syndrome that participate in APE need medical clearance due to the many medical problems they face. However they should still engage in aerobic activities, muscle strengthening, motor control skills, and balance building activities. Adapted equipment can be used to engage students in these activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Autism spectrum disorder ====
* Students that have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder do not necessarily need to be in an APE program. However, if it is decided that they need to participate in an APE program, the APE teacher needs to respond to the individual needs required by that student, which maybe one-on-one instruction. These students should engage in as much of the required PE curriculum as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|Page from Aleppo Codex, Deuteronomy]]

The '''Aleppo Codex''' ({{lang-he|כֶּתֶר אֲרָם צוֹבָא}} '''''Keter Aram Tzova''''' or '''Crown of Aleppo''') is a medieval bound manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The [[codex]] was written in the city of [[Tiberias]], in what is currently northern [[Israel]], in the 10th century C.E.,&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/920915.html Fragment of ancient parchment given to Jewish scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; and was endorsed for its accuracy by [[Maimonides]]. Together with the [[Leningrad Codex]], it contains the [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]] [[Masoretic Text|masoretic]] tradition, but the Aleppo Codex lacks most of the Torah section and many other parts.

==History==

=== Overview ===
The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jewish]] community of [[Jerusalem]] purchased the codex about a hundred years after it was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/32847 M. Nehmad, ''Keter Aram Tzova'', Aleppo 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pfeffer|first1=Anshel|title=Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/fragment-of-ancient-parchment-from-bible-given-to-jerusalem-scholars-1.232641|work=Haaretz|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Crusade]], the synagogue was plundered and the codex was transferred to Egypt, whose Jews paid a high price for its ransom.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; It was preserved at the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] then [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbanite]] synagogue in [[Old Cairo]], where it was consulted by [[Maimonides]], who described it as a text trusted by all Jewish scholars. It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides' descendants brought it to [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], leading to its present name.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt;

The Codex remained in Syria for five hundred years. In 1947, rioters enraged by the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] burned down the [[synagogue]] where it was kept.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; The Codex disappeared, then reemerged in 1958, when it was smuggled into [[Israel]] by [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jew]] Murad Faham, and presented to the president of the state, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. Some time after arrival, it was found that parts of the codex had been lost. The Aleppo Codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It is currently (2005) on display in the [[Israel Museum]].

The Aleppo Codex was submitted by Israel for inclusion in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register and was included in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Aleppo Codex | website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/aleppo-codex/ | access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karaite Jewish community of Jerusalem received the book from Israel ben Simha of [[Basra]] sometime between 1040 and 1050.&lt;ref name=judith&gt;[[Judith Olszowy-Schlanger|Olszowy-Schlanger, Judith]]. ''Karaite marriage documents from the Cairo Geniza: legal tradition and community life in mediaeval Egypt and Palestine.'' Etudes sur le judaïsme médiéval, t. 20. Leiden: Brill, 1998 ({{ISBN|9004108866}}), pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; It was cared for by the brothers Hizkiyahu and Joshya, Karaite religious leaders who eventually moved to [[Fustat]] in 1050. The codex, however, stayed in Jerusalem until the latter part of that century.&lt;ref name=judith/&gt; After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]] during the [[First Crusade]], the Crusaders held the codex and other holy works for ransom (along with Jewish survivors).&lt;ref name=ols&gt;Olszowy: pp. 54-55 and footnote #86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codex&gt;[http://www.aleppocodex.org/10.html The Vicissitudes of the Aleppo Codex]&amp;nbsp;– See ''4.4 The Crusades and the Ransoming of Books''. Retrieved on 2008–03–04.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aleppo Codex website cites two letters in the [[Cairo Geniza]] that describe how the inhabitants of [[Ashkelon]] borrowed money from Egypt to pay for the books.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; These [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] letters were discovered by noted Jewish historian [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kedar, Benjamin Z.

Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2004 ({{ISBN|075464099X}}), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon]]'', the more descriptive of the two, states that the money borrowed from [[Alexandria]] was used to “buy back two hundred and thirty Bible codices, a hundred other volumes, and eight Torah Scrolls."&lt;ref&gt;Goitein, S.D.

University of California Press, 1988 ({{ISBN|0520056477}}), pg. 376&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were transported to Egypt via a caravan led and funded by the prominent Alexandrian official Abu’l-Fadl Sahl b. Yūsha’ b. Sha‘yā, who was in Ascalon for his wedding in early 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Goitein: pp. 375–376 and footnote #81 on pg. 612&lt;/ref&gt; Judeo-Arabic inscriptions on the first page of the Codex mention the book was then "transferred to the Jerusalemite synagogue in Fustat."&lt;ref name="ols" /&gt; The Aleppo codex website reveals how the book changed hands.
{{quote|[It was] transferred&amp;nbsp;[...] according to the law of redemption from imprisonment [in which it had fallen] in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt and reestablished, to the congregation in Egypt of Knisat Yerushalayim, may it be built and established in the life of Israel. Blessed be he who preserves it and cursed be he who steals it, and cursed be he who sells it, and cursed be he who pawns it. It may not be sold and it may not be defiled forever.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt;}}

===In Aleppo===
The Aleppo community guarded the Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together with three other Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the [[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], supposed to have been the [[Cave of Elijah]]. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, who asked that various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the [[responsa]] literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, [[Shalom Shachne Yellin]] sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat for weeks, and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten [[Bible]]. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ''‘Ammudé Shesh'' by [[Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski]], and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by [[Yosef Ofer]] in 1989.

However, the community limited direct observation of the manuscript by outsiders, especially by scholars in modern times. [[Paul E. Kahle]], when revising the text of the ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' in the 1920s, tried and failed to obtain a photographic copy. This forced him to use the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'' instead for the third edition, which appeared in 1937.

The only modern scholar allowed to compare it with a standard printed [[Hebrew Bible]] and take notes on the differences was [[Umberto Cassuto]], who examined it in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wandering Bible: The Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/page_1358|website=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secrecy made it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the Codex, and indeed Cassuto doubted that it was Maimonides' codex, though he agreed that it was 10th-century.

During the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo]], the community's ancient synagogue was burned and the Codex was damaged. Later, after the Codex was in Israel, it was found that no more than 294 of the original (estimated) 487 pages survived.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer&gt;{{cite news | title = Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars | author = Anshel Pfeffer | date = November 6, 2007 | url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4995266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; there have been various reports and estimates of the original number of pages; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader'' (NY, [[KTAV Publishing House]], 1974) page 758 (estimating an original number of 380 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each page is parchment, 33 cm high by 26.5 cm wide (13 inches x 10.43 inches).&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z.

The missing leaves are a subject of fierce controversy. Originally it was thought they were destroyed by fire, but scholarly analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus).&lt;ref name=Pfeffer/&gt; Some scholars instead accuse members of the Jewish community of having torn off the missing leaves and keeping them privately hidden. Two "missing" leaves have turned up, one in 1982 and the other in 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947.&lt;ref name=holy&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ronen Bergman]] |title=A High Holy Whodunit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/the-aleppo-codex-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the 2012 book, ''The Aleppo Codex''  by [[Matti Friedman]], calls attention to the fact that eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of it for more than a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests a number of possibilities for the loss of the pages including theft in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Friedman, ''The Aleppo Codex'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2012) chapt. 24 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of Damascus possessed a counterpart of the Aleppo Codex, known as the "Damascus Keter", also written in Israel in the 10th century, which is now kept at the [[National Library of Israel]] and numbered ms. Heb 5702. It is available online here [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/]. (This should not be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin.)

===In Israel===
[[File:Jerusalem Schrein des Buches BW 1.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior view of the [[Shrine of the Book]]]]

In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria and sent to Jerusalem to be placed in the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews.&lt;ref name=friedman2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matti Friedman | title = The Continuing Mysteries of the Aleppo Codex | journal = [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] | date = June 30, 2014 | url = http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176903/aleppo-codex}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given first to [[Shlomo Zalman Shragai]] of the [[Jewish Agency]], who later testified that the Codex was complete or nearly so at the time.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; Later it was given to the [[Yad Ben Zvi|Ben-Zvi Institute]].&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; In 1958, the Jewish community of Aleppo sued the Ben-Zvi Institute for the return of the Codex, but the court ruled against them and suppressed publication of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt;

In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref name=holy /&gt; This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, it was the first time ever that a complete ''[[Tanakh]]'' had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.

Later, after the university denied him access to the codex, [[Mordechai Breuer]] began his own reconstruction of the Masoretic text on the basis of other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost exactly. Thus today, Breuer's version is used authoritatively for the reconstruction of the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]'' (כתר ירושלים, "Jerusalem Crown"), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its page layout.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Documentary film]]maker, Avi Dabach, great grandson of Chacham Ezra Dabach (one of the last caretakers of the Codex when it was still in Syria), announced in December 2015 an upcoming film tracing the history of the Codex and possibly determining the fate of the missing pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltz|first1=Judy|title=My Great-grandfather, the Man Who Held the Key to the Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.693328|website=Haaretz|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritative text==
The consonants in the codex were copied by the scribe Shlomo ben Buya'a in Israel circa 920. The text was then verified, vocalized, and provided with Masoretic notes by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], the last and most prominent member of the ben Asher dynasty of grammarians from [[Tiberias]], rivals to the [[ben Naphtali]] school. The tradition of ben Asher has become the one accepted for the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="ej2-ben-asher"&gt;{{citation | author=Zeev Ben-Hayyim | contribution=BEN-ASHER, AARON BEN MOSES | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ben Asher vocalization is late and in many respects artificial, compared to other traditions and tendencies reaching back closer to the period of spoken Biblical Hebrew.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible"&gt;{{citation | author=P. W. Skehan | contribution=BIBLE (TEXTS) | title=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] | edition=2nd | volume=2 | publisher=Gale | year=2003 | pages=355–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', which dates to approximately the same time as the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher [[scriptorium]]. However, its [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Aron Dotan]] | contribution=MASORAH | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=13 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=603–656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleppo Codex was the manuscript used by Maimonides when he set down the exact rules for writing scrolls of the [[Torah]], ''Hilkhot [[Sefer Torah]]'' ("the Laws of the Torah Scroll") in his ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; This [[halakha|halachic]] ruling gave the Aleppo Codex the seal of supreme textual authority, albeit only with regard to the type of space preceding sections (''petuhot'' and ''setumot'') and for the manner of the writing of the songs in the Pentateuch.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah" /&gt; "The codex which we used in these works is the codex known in [[Egypt]], which includes 24 books, which was in [[Jerusalem]]," he wrote. [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] testifies to this being the same codex that was later transferred to Aleppo.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Contents==
When the Aleppo Codex was complete (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual tradition in the order of its books, similar to the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', and which also matches the later tradition of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] biblical manuscripts. The [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im]] appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for the books for [[Ketuvim]] differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is [[Books of Chronicles]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Book of Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]].

The current text is missing all of the [[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]] to the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 28.17; [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 14.21–18.13; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 29.9–31.33; 32.2–4, 9–11, 21–24; [[Book of Amos]] 8.12–[[Book of Micah]] 5.1; So 3.20–Za 9.17; II Chronicles 26.19–35.7; Book of Psalms 15.1–25.2 (MT enumeration); Song of Songs 3.11 to the end; all of Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra-Nehemiah.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible" /&gt;

== Modern editions ==
Several complete or partial editions of the [[Tanakh]] based on the Aleppo Codex have been published over the past three decades in Israel, some of them under the academic auspices of Israeli universities. These editions incorporate reconstructions of the missing parts of the codex based on the methodology of [[Mordechai Breuer]] or similar systems, and by taking into account all available historical testimony about the contents of the codex.

'''Complete Tanakh:'''
These are complete editions of the [[Tanakh]], usually in one volume (but sometimes also sold in three volumes). They do ''not'' include the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
# [[Mossad Harav Kook]] edition, [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. [[Torah]] (1977); [[Nebi'im]] (1979); [[Ketubim]] (1982); full [[Tanakh]] in one volume 1989. This was the first edition to include a reconstruction of the letters, vowels, and cantillation marks in the missing parts of the Aleppo codex.
# Horev publishers, Jerusalem, 1996–98. [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. This was the first edition to incorporate newly discovered information on the [[parashah]] divisions of the Aleppo Codex for [[Nebi'im]] and [[Ketubim]]. The text of the Horev Tanakh has been reprinted in several forms with various commentaries by the same publisher.&lt;ref name="Taj"&gt;In this edition, the masoretic text and symbols were encoded and graphic layout was enabled by the computer program ''Taj'', developed by Daniel Weissman.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]: The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem'', 2000. Edited according to the method of [[Mordechai Breuer]] under the supervision of Yosef Ofer, with additional proofreading and refinements since the Horev edition.&lt;ref name="Taj" /&gt;
# Jerusalem Simanim Institute, Feldheim Publishers, 2004 (published in one-volume and three-volume editions).&lt;ref name="Taj" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"After consultation... with the greatest Torah scholars and grammarians, the biblical text in this edition was chosen to conform with the Aleppo Codex which as is well known was corrected by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]]... Where this manuscript is not extant we have relied on the [[Leningrad Codex]]... Similarly the open and closed [[parashah|sections]] that are missing in the Aleppo Codex have been completed according to the biblical list compiled by Rabbi Shalom Shachna Yelin that were published in the Jubilee volume for Rabbi Breuer... (translated from the Hebrew on p. 12 of the introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complete online Tanakh:'''
* Mechon Mamre provides an online edition of the [[Tanakh]] based upon the Aleppo Codex and related Tiberian manuscripts. Its reconstruction of the missing text is based on the methods of Mordechai Breuer. The text is offered in four formats: (a) Masoretic letter-text, (b) "full" letter-text (unrelated to masoretic spelling), (c) masoretic text with vowels ([[niqqud]]), and (d) masoretic text with vowels and [[cantillation]] signs. See [[#External links|external links]] below.
* '''[[:s:he:משתמש:Dovi/מקרא על פי המסורה|"Miqra according to the Mesorah"]]''' is an experimental, digital version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex with full documentation of the editorial policy and its implementation ([[:s:User:Dovi/Miqra according to the Mesorah|English-language abstract]]).

'''Partial editions:'''
* [[Hebrew University Bible Project]] (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel). Includes the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
* [[Mikraot Gedolot]] Haketer, [[Bar-Ilan University]] (1992–present). A multi-volume critical edition of the [[Mikraot Gedolot]], sixteen volumes published to date including Genesis (2 vols.), Exodus (2 vols.), Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua &amp; Judges (1 vol.), Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Minor Prophets, Psalms (2 vols.), Five Megillot (1 vol.), Chronicles. Includes the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex and a new commentary on them. Differs from the Breuer reconstruction and presentation for some masoretic details.
* Torat Hayim, published by Mossad ha-Rav Kook (Torah, Proverbs, and Five Megillot).
* Chorev Mikraot Gedolot by Hotzaat Chorev (Torah only).

An '''atelier''' ({{IPA-fr|atəlje|lang}}) is the private [[workshop]] or [[studio]] of a professional artist in the [[fine art|fine]] or [[decorative arts]], where a principal [[Master craftsman|master]] and a number of assistants, students, and apprentices can work together producing pieces of [[fine art]] or [[visual arts|visual art]] released under the master's name or supervision.

This was the standard vocational practice for European artists from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 19th century, and common elsewhere in the world. In [[medieval Europe]] such a way of working and form of visual or fine art education was often enforced by local [[guild]] regulations, of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]], and those of other guilds for other crafts. [[Apprentice]]s usually began young, working on simple tasks, and after some years became [[journeymen]], before becoming masters themselves. The system was gradually replaced as the once powerful guilds declined, and the [[academy]] became a favored method of training, although many professional artists continued to use students and assistants, some paid by the artist, some paying fees to learn.&lt;ref name=Harrap&gt;Diana Davies (editor), ''Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists'', Harrap Books Limited, (1990) {{ISBN|0-245-54692-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the atelier consists of a master [[artist]], usually a professional [[Painting|painter]], sculptor, or from the mid-19th century a fine art photographer, working with a small number of students to train them in visual or fine arts. This very word has also taken on other similar meanings, indicating a place of work and study of the [[haute couture]] fashion designer, [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] and artists in general. Atelier schools can be found around the world, particularly in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Janson |first1=H. W. |last2=Janson |first2=Anthony F. |title=History of Art |edition=5th |location=London |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |page=629 |isbn=0500237018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the methods vary, most painting ateliers train students in the skills and techniques associated with creating some form of representational art, the making of two-dimensional images that appear real to the viewer. They traditionally include sessions for drawing or painting [[Nude (art)|nude art]].

==Methods==
===Sight-Size===
[[Image:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Apollo Belvedere]],'' (350-325 BC) [[Vatican Museums]]]] [[Image:Tizian 041.jpg|right|thumb|[[Titian]], ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (1516–1518)]]

'''Sight-Size''' is a method of drawing and painting an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale. The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface appear to be the same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools—which can include [[Spirit level|levels]], [[mirror]]s, [[plumb bob]]s, strings, and sticks—the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same [[dimensions]]. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It can also be used to draw the exact dimensions for a [[Model (art)|model]] in preparation for a painting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Ateliers following the sight-size method generally agree that the practice of careful [[drawing]] is the basis of [[painting]], teaching a form of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] based upon careful observations of nature with attention to detail. Using this method, students progress through a series of tasks such as cast drawing, cast painting, drawing and painting from the live model, and still life. Students must complete each task to the instructor's satisfaction before progressing to the next. This system is referred to as "systematic progression" or "systematic teaching and learning".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Atelier students often begin this progression by drawing [[Plaster#Use in sculptural arts|plaster]] casts. These casts are usually faces, hands, or other parts of the [[human anatomy]]. Plaster casts provide some of the benefits of live, human models, such as the presence of [[natural]] [[shadows]]. They also have their own distinct advantages: they remain perfectly still and their white color allows the student to focus on the pure, [[grayscale]] tones of shadows.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

One goal for sight-size students is to gain enough skill to transfer an accurate image to the paper or canvas without the aid of a mechanical device. Contemporary realist painter Adrian Gottlieb notes that "while professional painters pursuing a full-time career will develop an 'eye' that precludes the need for measuring devices and plumb lines (tools necessary during the training period), the observation method itself is not abandoned - instead it becomes second nature. Sight-size can be taught and applied in conjunction with a particular sensitivity to gesture to create life-like imagery; especially when applied to portraiture and figurative works."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Darren R. Rousar, former student of Richard Lack and [[Charles H. Cecil Studios|Charles Cecil]] as well as the author of ''Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach'', agrees and defines measuring in broad terms. He says that "a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or even consciously think about literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317065127/http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archivedate=2009-03-17 |title=Sight-Size Misconceptions |website=Sight-Size.com |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art school owner Charles H. Cecil writes:

:In reviving the atelier tradition, [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) adopted sight-size as the basis of his teaching method. He founded his studio on the precedent of private ateliers, such as those of [[Carolus-Duran]] and [[Léon Bonnat]]. These French masters were accomplished sight-size portraitists who conveyed to their pupils a devotion to the art of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]. It should be noted that Sargent was trained by both painters and that, in turn, his use of sight-size had a major influence in Great Britain and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescecilstudios.com/html/philosophy/atelierTradition.html |title=Atelier tradition|author= Charles H. Cecil Studios |accessdate= September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art from ateliers using the sight-size method is often reminiscent of Greek and Roman sculpture from [[classical antiquity]], such as the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. Paintings may favor the visual imagery of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] art of the mid-18th to 19th century. The sight-size method also lends itself to styles of portraiture in which the artists desires an accurate, natural, true to life or even near photographic image of the sitter as is evident in the work of [[Bouguereau]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Comparative measurement===
The comparative measurement method requires proportional accuracy, but allows the artist to vary the size of the image created. This technique broadly encompasses any method of drawing that involves making accurate measurements primarily using the naked eye. In the early training period students may be aided by a pencil, brush or [[plumb line]] to make comparisons, but there is no transfer of 1:1 measurements from subject directly to paper.  Schools that teach this method include The Water Street Atelier and The Swedish Academy of Realist Art.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In his essay, "[https://www.swedishacademyofrealistart.se/comparative-method The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages]", the painter and instructor Hans-Peter Szameit, of the Swedish Academy of Realist Art, discusses the disadvantages of sight-size, describing it as essentially the making of a mechanically produced image limited to one size, the "sight size".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atelierstockholm.se/about/sight-size/| title= The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages| author=Szameit, Hans-Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illusion===
[[File:Léon Bonnat - Idylle.JPG|thumb|left|[[Léon Bonnat]], ''Idylle'' (1890) [[Musée Bonnat]]]]
Another traditional atelier method incorporates the use of illusions that fool the viewer into believing an image is accurate. This method is most often taught in conjunction with advanced compositional theory. Since it is not necessary to copy the subject accurately to achieve a successful illusion, this method allows the artist to experiment with many options while retaining what appears to be a realistic image.

In one example, the ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending'' (c. 1613–1614 (drawn), in ''The Education of Marie de' Medici''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=V&amp;A Images|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1069261/study-of-a-male-figure-drawing-rubens-peter-paul/|title=Prints, Drawings and Paintings Collection: ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending in 'The Education of Marie de Medici'|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Rubens has obscured the point where the legs attach to the torso. This is one factor that contributes to the ease in which he is able to successfully experiment with a variety of dramatically different leg placements. At least three sets of feet are visible. The viewer is not disturbed by an illogical attachment if the attachment is not visible and the resulting two-dimensional image is pleasing to the eye. This allows the artist to choose from a great number of very different alternatives, making his selection based on personal preference or aesthetics rather than accuracy. In the referenced exercise it is possible to experiment with numerous manipulations regarding the size and placement of each part of the body while at the same time using a collection of two-dimensional foreshortening illusions to retain the appearance of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyorktelco.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Creative_Foreshortening_Exercise.pdf |title=Creative Foreshortening Exercise |author=Simon, Trinka Margua |date=2008 |work=The Art of Composition |isbn=978-0-615-23934-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130030/http://newyorktelco.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Creative_Foreshortening_Exercise.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to body parts, artists may rely on the manipulation of many other elements to achieve a successful illusion. These can include: the manipulation of color, value, edge characteristics, overlapping shapes, and a number of different types of paint applications such as [[glazing (window)|glazing]] and [[scumbling]]. Work developed this way would not begin with a drawing, but rather the placement of all relevant elements necessary for the success of the illusions as well as the composition as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1505989?uid=3738984&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104848463297 Varnish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurney|first=James|title=James Gurney Interview|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the illusions designed to mimic reality also speed the painting process, allowing artists more time to design and complete complex large-scale works.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Individual students of this method study a diverse selection of old masters, although many begin their studies with the [[High Renaissance]] (1490s–1527), [[Mannerist]] (1520–1580), [[Baroque]] (1600–1725), and [[Impressionist]] (1870s–1880s) painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Degas]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Rubens]], and [[Titian]]. However, because the emphasis is on creativity, it is often the design of the composition and the application and use of materials that is studied with less focus on reproducing a particular style or subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Students of these ateliers will therefore exhibit a wide range of personal styles and increasing amounts of creative experimentation. The result is a group whose art is highly individualized, with each student pursuing their own individual interests. There was great diversity at the atelier of [[Léon Bonnat]] (1846–1855). Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as "a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail."&lt;ref name="Bonnat"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julius |last=Kaplan |contribution=Leon Bonnat |title=The Dictionary of Art |volume=IV |location=New York |publisher=Grove |year=1996 |isbn=9781884446009 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scandinavian"&gt;{{cite web | last=Weisberg| first=Gabriel | title=Gabriel P.

A '''Bible concordance''' is a [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]], or verbal index, to the [[Bible]]. A simple form lists Biblical words alphabetically, with indications to enable the inquirer to find the passages of the Bible where the words occur.

Concordances may be for the original languages of the Biblical books, or (more commonly) they are compiled for translations.

==Latin==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Friars of the [[Dominican order]] invented the verbal concordance of the Bible. As the basis of their work they used the text of the ''[[Latin Vulgate]]'', the standard Bible of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. The first concordance, completed in 1230, was undertaken under the guidance of Cardinal [[Hugo de Saint-Cher]] (Hugo de Sancto Charo), assisted by fellow Dominicans.

It contained short quotations (see the Ms. Saint-Omer, Bibliothèque municipale, 0028 &lt;ref&gt;[https://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/consult/consult.php?mode=ecran&amp;panier=false&amp;reproductionId=5540&amp;VUE_ID=1185442&amp;carouselThere=false&amp;nbVignettes=4x3&amp;page=1&amp;angle=0&amp;zoom=grand&amp;tailleReelle=true Online access to the first page of the Concordance by Hugues de St. Cher]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the passages where a word was found. These were indicated by book and chapter (the division into chapters had recently been made by [[Stephen Langton]]) but not by verses, which [[Robert Estienne]] would first introduce in 1545. In lieu of verses, Hugo divided each chapter into seven almost equal parts, indicated by the letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc.

Three English Dominicans (1250–1252) added the complete quotations of the passages indicated. Due to lack of space, present-day concordances do not aim for this completeness of quotation; it is likely,{{original research inline|date=March 2016}} therefore, that the passages indicated were far fewer than those found in a complete concordance of today. The work was somewhat abridged, by retaining only the essential words of a quotation, in the 1310 concordance of [[Conrad of Halberstadt]], another Dominican - his work obtained great success on account of its more convenient form.

The first concordance to be printed appeared in 1470 at Strasburg, and reached a second edition in 1475. The larger work from which it was abridged was printed at Nuremberg in 1485. Another Dominican, [[John Stoicowic]], or [[John of Ragusa]], finding it necessary in his controversies to show the Biblical usage of ''nisi'', ''ex'', and ''per'', which were omitted from the previous concordances, began (c. 1435) the compilation of nearly all the indeclinable words of Latin Scripture; the task was completed and perfected by others and finally added as an appendix to the concordance of Conrad of Halberstadt in the work of [[Sebastian Brant]] published at Basle in 1496. Brant's work was frequently republished and in various cities. It served as the basis of the concordance published in 1555 by Robert Estienne.  Estienne added proper names, supplied omissions, mingled the indeclinable words with the others in alphabetical order, and gave the indications to all passages by verse as well as by chapter, bringing his work much closer to the present model of concordances. Since then many different Latin concordances have been published:
[[File:Concordance of Latin Vulgate Bible.jpg|thumb|5 volume concordance to the Latin Vulgate Bible]]
* [[Plantinus]]'s "Concordantiæ Bibliorum juxta recognitionem Clementinam" (Antwerp, 1599), which was the first made according to the authorized Latin text;
* "Repertorium Biblicum ... studio ... Patrum Ordinis S. Benedicti, Monasterii Wessofontani" (Augsburg, 1751)
* "Concordantiæ Script. Sac.", by [[Dutripon]], in two immense volumes, the most useful of all Latin concordances, which gives enough of every text to make complete sense (Paris, 1838; seventh ed. 1880)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/BibliorumSacrorumConcordantiae Online access to the concordance of Dutripon]&lt;/ref&gt;
* an edition of the same by G. Tonini, at [[Prato]], 1861, recognized as nearly complete
* V. Coornaert's ''Concordantiae librorum Veteris et Novi Testamenti Domini Nostri Jesu Christi juxta Vulgatam editionem, jussu Sixti V, Pontificis Maximi, recognitam ad usum praedicatorum'', intended for the use of preachers (Bruges, 1892)
*the "Concordantiarum S. Scripturæ Manuale", by H. de Raze, Ed. de Lachaud, and J.-B. Flandrin (13th ed., Paris, 1895), which gives rather a choice of texts than a complete concordance
*"Concordantiarum Universæ Scripturæ Sacræ Thesaurus", by Fathers Peultier, Etienne, and Gantois (Paris, 1902)

Peter Mintert's "Lexicon Græco-Latinum" of the New  Testament is a concordance as well as a lexicon, giving the Latin equivalent of the Greek and, in the case of ''[[Septuagint]]'' words, the Hebrew equivalent also (Frankfort, 1728).

==Hebrew==

The first Hebrew concordance (''Meïr Netib'') was the work of [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]], begun in 1438 and finished in 1448. It was inspired by the Latin concordances to aid in [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews#Christian missions|defence of Judaism]], and was printed in Venice in 1523. An improved edition of it by a Franciscan monk, [[Marius de Calasio]], was published in 1621 and 1622 in four volumes. Both these works were several times reprinted, while another Hebrew concordance of the sixteenth century, by [[Elias Levita]], said to surpass Nathan's in many respects, remained in manuscript.

Nathan and Calasio arranged the words according to the Hebrew roots, the derivatives following simply according to the order in which they occur in the Hebrew books; the [[Buxtorf]]s, father and son, introduced order into the derivatives by a grammatical classification of the verbs and nouns. Their work (Basle, 1632) also contained many new words and passages previously omitted, and an appendix of all the Chaldaic words in the O. T.; Baer's edition of Buxtorf (1847) added certain particles.

[[Fürst]]'s concordance (Leipzig, 1840) was for a long time the standard. It corrected Buxtorf and brought it nearer to completeness, printed all Hebrew words with the vowel-points, and perfected the order of the derivatives. Every word is explained in Hebrew and Latin. Fürst excludes, however, the proper nouns, the pronouns, and most of the indeclinable particles, and makes many involuntary omissions and errors; his classification of roots is sometimes fanciful.{{who says|date=June 2018}} "The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldaic Concordance" (London, 1843; third edition, 1866) is still considered very useful.{{by whom|date=June 2018}}

A comprehensive Hebrew concordance is that of [[Mandelkern]] (Leipzig, 1896), who rectified the errors of his predecessors and supplied omitted references. Though his own work has been shown to be frequently imperfect, still it is almost complete. An abridged edition of it was published in 1900.

[[A New Concordance of the Bible]] (full title A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible, Hebrew and Aramaic, Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms) by [[Avraham Even-Shoshan]] is a concordance of the Hebrew text of the Hebrew Bible, first published in 1977. The source text used is that of the Koren edition of 1958.

==Greek Septuagint==
[[File:HatchRedpath2-23psi-1486.png|thumb|page from Hatch-Redpath concordance]]
The first was that of [[Conrad Kircher]] (Frankfort, 1607); Tromm's, published at Amsterdam, 1718, had reference not only to the ''Septuagint'', but also to the versions of [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], and [[Theodotion]]. It remained the standard until it gave way to [[Edwin Hatch]] and [[Henry Adeney Redpath]]'s "Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Versions of the Old Testament" (Oxford, 1892–97). This includes a concordance to the [[deutero-canonical books]] and the [[Old Testament Apocrypha]], and to the remains of the versions which form part of [[Origen of Alexandria]]'s ''[[Hexapla]]''. The Hebrew equivalents of the Greek, when known, are also given. References to proper names are added in a supplement published in 1900. Bagster's "Handy Concordance to the Septuagint" (London, 1887) gives simply the references, without quotations.

==Greek New Testament==

The earliest concordances to the ''[[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]'' are those of Birken or [[Betulius]] (Basle, 1546), [[Henry Estienne]] (Paris, 1594), and [[Erasmus Schmid]] (Wittenberg, 1638), whose work was twice revised and republished. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the standard New Testament concordance was that of [[Karl Hermann Bruder|Bruder]] (Leipzig, 1842; 4th ed., 1888). Its main defect is that it was practically based on the ''[[textus receptus]]'', though it aims, in its latest editions to give also the chief variants.

[[William Fiddian Moulton|Moulton]] and [[Alfred Shenington Geden|Geden]]'s ''Concordance to the Greek Testament'', according to the text of [[Westcott-Hort|Westcott and Hort]], [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], and the English Revisers (Edinburgh and New York, 1897) includes all the marginal readings. In the case of a reading being in dispute among these authorities, the fact is pointed out. The Hebrew equivalents of all quotations in the N. T. are given; the relation of the Greek N. T. words to the Septuagint and other O. T. Greek versions, as well as to classical usage, is indicated. Two other concordances are ''The Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament'' by [[George Wigram|G. V. Wigram]] (London, 1839, 2d ed. 1844), and Hudson's ''Critical Greek and English Concordance of the N. T.'' (Boston, 1875), which contains references to the chief variant readings.

==Syriac==

[[Charles Schaaf]]'s "Lexicon Syriacum" (Leyden, 1709) practically serves the purpose of a concordance to the ''[[Peshito]]'' version.

==English==

The earliest concordances in English were published in the middle of the sixteenth century, the first by [[Thomas Gybson]] in 1535 (for the New Testament only), and the second in 1550 by [[John Marbeck]]. The most famous one, ''[[Cruden's Concordance]]'' was the work of [[Alexander Cruden]]. First published in 1738, it reached several editions in his own lifetime and has been re-edited, abridged and reprinted repeatedly. Cruden's work is not a complete concordance, and omits especially many references to proper names, but his last edition had a concordance to the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament, which, however, is usually not reprinted.

It was surpassed by three major concordances of the King James Version of the Bible, those of [[Robert Young (Biblical scholar)|Robert Young]], [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]], and Walker.

*''[[Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible]]'' (Edinburgh, 1879–84), an almost complete concordance, indicates the Hebrew, Chaldaic, or Greek original of the English word, and distinguishes the various meanings that may underlie the same word.
*''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' has reference only to the English text. It contains also a comparative concordance between the Authorized and Revised English versions, useful for a study of the changes introduced.
*Walker's ''Comprehensive Concordance to the Holy Scriptures'' (Boston, 1894) is almost as complete as Strong's. A ''Complete Concordance to the Revised Version of the New Testamen'', by J. A. Thoms, was published in London, 1884.

These were followed by a concordance based on the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay–Rheims translation]] of the Bible preferred by Roman Catholics, ''A Textual Concordance of the Holy Scriptures'' by Father Thomas David Williams, 1942.

==Contemporary use ==
Since software has made the Bible available in electronic form and with thorough electronic indexes, hard-copy printed  concordances have less application. Most scholars and Bible students rely instead on software.{{citation needed|date = November 2010}}

Due to Strong's numbers (see ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'') it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible ("Новая учебная Библия Томпсона", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society "The Bible for everyone", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible]] (''The New Thompson Study Bible.'' La Buona Novella Inc. &amp; B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then it's Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.

'''Burton MacDonald''' (born September 13, 1939) is a Canadian [[biblical archaeologist]] specialising in the archaeology of [[Jordan]]. He has been a professor at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] since 1965.

==Early life and education==
MacDonald attended [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (St. F. X.) and graduated with a BA in philosophy in 1960.

A '''cognitive map''' (sometimes called a [[mental map]] or [[mental model]]) is a type of [[mental representation]] which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. The concept was introduced by [[Edward C. Tolman|Edward Tolman]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="pmid18870876"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolman |first=Edward C. |authorlink=Edward C.

[...] The cycle of ''problem construction'', ''making sense'', ''defining the problem'', and declaring a ''portfolio of solutions'', which I have discussed elsewhere (Eden, 1982) is the framework that guides the process of working with teams. Thus building and working with the cognitive maps of each individual is primarily aimed at helping each team member reflectively 'construct' and 'make sense' of the situation they believe the team is facing.

Let us just say that cognitive maps are the representation of an individual's personal knowledge, of an individual's own experience (Weick and Bougon, 1986), and they are ways of representing individuals' views of reality (Eden et al., 1981). There are various types of cognitive maps (Huff, 1990). (pp. [//books.google.com/books?id=LE95fcRz_IcC&amp;pg=PA21 21–22])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Cognitive maps have been studied in various fields, such as psychology, education, archaeology, planning, geography, cartography, architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, management and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conspiracy nation: the politics of paranoia in Postwar America |last=Knight |first=Peter |year=2002 |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |location=New York and London |isbn=0814747353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2016}} As a consequence, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive  maps, [[mental map]]s, [[Behavioral script|script]]s, [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]], and [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]].

Cognitive maps serve the construction and accumulation of spatial knowledge, allowing the "[[mind's eye]]" to visualize images in order to reduce [[cognitive load]], enhance [[recollection|recall]] and [[learning]] of information. This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving [[memory]] and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kitchin |first=Robert M. |title=Cognitive maps: what are they and why study them? |journal=[[Journal of Environmental Psychology]] |year=1994 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80194-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neural correlate]]s of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the [[place cell]] system in the [[hippocampus]]&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Keefe |first1=John |authorlink1=John O'Keefe (neuroscientist) |last2=Nadel |first2=Lynn |authorlink2=Lynn Nadel |date=1978 |title=The hippocampus as a cognitive map |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]; [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0198572069 |oclc=4430731 |url=http://www.cognitivemap.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recently discovered [[grid cells]] in the [[entorhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid16675704"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargolini |first1=Francesca |last2=Fyhn |first2=Marianne |last3=Hafting |first3=Torkel |last4=McNaughton |first4=Bruce L. |last5=Witter |first5=Menno P. |last6=Moser |first6=May-Britt |last7=Moser |first7=Edvard I. |title=Conjunctive representation of position, direction, and velocity in entorhinal cortex |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=312 |issue=5774 |pages=758–762 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16675704 |doi=10.1126/science.1125572 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..758S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological basis ==

Cognitive mapping is believed to largely be a function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is connected to the rest of the brain in such a way that it is ideal for integrating both spatial and nonspatial information. Connections from the [[postrhinal cortex]] and the medial entorhinal cortex provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Connections from the [[perirhinal cortex]] and lateral entorhinal cortex provide nonspatial information. The integration of this information in the hippocampus makes the hippocampus a practical location for cognitive mapping, which necessarily involves combining information about an object's location and its other features.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manns |first1=Joseph R. |last2=Eichenbaum |first2=Howard |authorlink2=Howard Eichenbaum |date=October 2009 |title=A cognitive map for object memory in the hippocampus |journal=[[Learning &amp; Memory]] |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=616–624 |doi=10.1101/lm.1484509 |pmc=2769165 |pmid=19794187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe and Nadel were the first to outline a relationship between the hippocampus and cognitive mapping.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe" /&gt; Many additional studies have shown additional evidence that supports this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Moser&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Edvard I. |authorlink1=Edvard Moser |last2=Kropff |first2=Emilio |last3=Moser |first3=May-Britt |authorlink3=May-Britt Moser |date=2008 |title=Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system |journal=[[Annual Review of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |pages=69–89 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723 |pmid=18284371 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/7t2VcSrTYa8V8yACMweG/full/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[pyramidal cells]] ([[place cells]], [[boundary cell]]s, and [[grid cells]]) have been implicated as the neuronal basis for cognitive maps within the hippocampal system.

Numerous studies by O'Keefe have implicated the involvement of place cells. Individual place cells within the hippocampus correspond to separate locations in the environment with the sum of all cells contributing to a single map of an entire environment. The strength of the connections between the cells represents the distances between them in the actual environment. The same cells can be used for constructing several environments, though individual cells' relationships to each other may differ on a map by map basis.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe" /&gt; The possible involvement of place cells in cognitive mapping has been seen in a number of mammalian species, including rats and macaque monkeys.&lt;ref name=Moser /&gt; Additionally, in a study of rats by Manns and Eichenbaum, pyramidal cells from within the hippocampus were also involved in representing object location and object identity, indicating their involvement in the creation of cognitive maps.&lt;ref name=Manns /&gt; However, there has been some dispute as to whether such studies of mammalian species indicate the presence of a cognitive map and not another, simpler method of determining one's environment.&lt;ref name=Bennet /&gt;

While not located in the hippocampus, grid cells from within the medial entorhinal cortex have also been implicated in the process of [[path integration]], actually playing the role of the path integrator while place cells display the output of the information gained through path integration.&lt;ref name=McNaughton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McNaughton |first1=Bruce L. |last2=Battaglia |first2=Francesco P. |last3=Jensen |first3=Ole |last4=Moser |first4=Edvard I. |authorlink4=Edvard Moser |last5=Moser |first5=May-Britt |authorlink5=May-Britt Moser |date=August 2006 |title=Path integration and the neural basis of the 'cognitive map' |journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]] |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=663–678 |doi=10.1038/nrn1932 |pmid=16858394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of path integration are then later used by the hippocampus to generate the cognitive map.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt; The cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus, even if it is primarily based there. Other than the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps.&lt;ref name=Moser /&gt;

=== Parallel map theory ===

There has been some evidence for the idea that the cognitive map is represented in the [[hippocampus]] by two separate maps. The first is the bearing map, which represents the environment through self-movement cues and [[gradient]] cues. The use of these [[vector (mathematics)|vector]]-based cues creates a rough, 2D map of the environment. The second map would be the sketch map that works off of positional cues. The second map integrates specific objects, or [[landmark]]s, and their relative locations to create a 2D map of the environment. The cognitive map is thus obtained by the integration of these two separate maps.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt;

==Generation==

The cognitive map is generated from a number of sources, both from the [[visual system]] and elsewhere. Much of the cognitive map is created through self-generated movement [[sensory cue|cues]]. Inputs from senses like vision, [[proprioception]], olfaction, and hearing are all used to deduce a person's location within their environment as they move through it. This allows for path integration, the creation of a vector that represents one's position and direction within one's environment, specifically in comparison to an earlier reference point. This resulting vector can be passed along to the hippocampal place cells where it is interpreted to provide more information about the environment and one's location within the context of the cognitive map.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacobs |first1=Lucia F. |last2=Schenk |first2=Françoise |date=April 2003 |title=Unpacking the cognitive map: the parallel map theory of hippocampal function |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=285–315 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.110.2.285 |pmid=12747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directional cues and positional landmarks are also used to create the cognitive map. Within directional cues, both explicit cues, like markings on a compass, as well as gradients, like shading or magnetic fields, are used as inputs to create the cognitive map. Directional cues can be used both statically, when a person does not move within his environment while interpreting it, and dynamically, when movement through a gradient is used to provide information about the nature of the surrounding environment. Positional landmarks provide information about the environment by comparing the relative position of specific objects, whereas directional cues give information about the shape of the environment itself. These landmarks are processed by the hippocampus together to provide a graph of the environment through relative locations.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt;

== History ==

The idea of a cognitive map was first developed by [[Edward C. Tolman]]. Tolman, one of the early cognitive psychologists, introduced this idea when doing an experiment involving rats and mazes. In Tolman's experiment, a rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial cognitive map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=E. Bruce |date=2011 |title=Cognitive psychology: connecting mind, research, and everyday experience |edition=3rd |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Wadsworth Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9780840033550 |oclc=658234658 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In a review, Andrew T.D. Bennett argued that there is no clear evidence for cognitive maps in non-human animals (i.e. cognitive map according to Tolman's definition).&lt;ref name=Bennet&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Andrew T. D. |date=January 1996 |title=Do animals have cognitive maps? |journal=[[The Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=199 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=219–224 |pmid=8576693}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is based on analyses of studies where it has been found that simpler explanations can account for experimental results. Bennett highlights three simpler alternatives that cannot be ruled out in tests of cognitive maps in non-human animals "These alternatives are (1) that the apparently novel short-cut is not truly novel; (2) that path integration is being used; and (3) that familiar landmarks are being recognised from a new angle, followed by movement towards them."

A cognitive map is a spatial representation of the outside world that is kept within the mind, until an actual manifestation (usually, a drawing) of this perceived knowledge is generated, a mental map. Cognitive mapping is the implicit, mental mapping the explicit part of the same process. In most cases, a cognitive map exists independently of a mental map, an article covering just cognitive maps would remain limited to theoretical considerations.

In some uses, mental map refers to a practice done by urban theorists by having city dwellers draw a map, from memory, of their city or the place they live. This allows the theorist to get a sense of which parts of the city or dwelling are more substantial or imaginable. This, in turn, lends itself to a decisive idea of how well urban planning has been conducted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">'''Cognitive specialization''' suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an [[adaptive]] purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival.  Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of [[language]], [[theory of mind]], and specific social skills such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]]. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with [[autism spectrum disorder]] or who lack language abilities.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995"&gt;Povinelli D., Preuss T (1995). Theory of mind: evolutionary history of a cognitive specialization, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 18, Issue 9, Pages 418–424, ISSN 0166-2236, doi:10.1016/0166-2236(95)93939-U. {{PMID|7482808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as [[self-awareness]], [[navigation]], and problem solving skills in several animal species such as [[chimpanzees]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]].

== Background ==
First studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans,&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their [[habitats]]; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]], which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes,&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z., &amp; Cantlon, J. F. (2011). The specialization of function: Cognitive and neural perspectives. Cognitive neuropsychology, 28(3–4), 147–155. doi:10.1080/02643294.2011.633504 {{PMID|22185234}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the [[neocortex]] unique to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: The new science of language and mind (Vol. 7529). Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in [[foraging]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A. Robinson, G. (2007). Evo-devo and the evolution of social behavior, Trends in Genetics, Volume 23, Issue 7, Pages 334–341, ISSN 0168-9525 doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2007.05.001 {{PMID|17509723}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-awareness, or other adaptive abilities.

== Social behavior ==
Social communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., &amp; Price, M. E. (2006). Cognitive adaptations for n‐person exchange: the evolutionary roots of organizational behavior. Managerial and Decision Economics, 27(2–3), 103–129. {{PMID|23814325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, S. (2006). Cognition at the heart of human interaction. Discourse Studies, 8(1), 85–93&lt;/ref&gt; Some social behaviors, such as helping and [[wikt:altruism|altruism]], are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, H. C., Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (2010) Coevolution of cooperation, causal cognition and mindreading. Communicative &amp; integrative biology, 3(6), 522–4. {{PMID|21331228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] argue that the human mind contains "specialized mechanisms" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992"&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The adapted mind, 163–228. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122352999&lt;/ref&gt; Without this specialized "[[algorithm]]",&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including "cheater detection" and "precautionary reasoning," both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, V. E., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Kroll, N., &amp; Knight, R. T. (2002) Selective impairment of reasoning about social exchange in a patient with bilateral limbic system damage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11531–11536. doi  10.1073/pnas.122352699 {{PMID|12177408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults,&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Prince, C. G., &amp; Preuss, T. M. (2005). Parent-Offspring Conﬂict and the Development of Social Understanding. The Innate Mind: Structure and Contents: Structure and Contents, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; across cultures,&lt;ref name="Shiw"&gt;Sugiyama, L. S., Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (2002). Cross-cultural evidence of cognitive adaptations for social exchange among the Shiwiar of Ecuadorian Amazonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11537–11542. doi 10.1073/pnas.122352999 {{PMID|12177409}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[neuropsychiatric]] populations.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Evidence for universality ===
If social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides  investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were "as highly proficient" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social "algorithms" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt;

== Theory of mind ==
[[Theory of mind]], or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C.M. (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101-114. doi 10.1017/s0140525x98000703 {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellema, T., Baker, C. I., Wicker, B., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (2000). Neural representation for the perception of the intentionality of actions. Brain and cognition, 44(2), 280–302. doi 10.1006/brcg.2000.1231 {{PMID|11041992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between [[Vagrancy (biology)|accidental]] and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own.&lt;ref name ="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Cross, D., &amp; Watson, J. (2001). Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief. Child development, 72(3), 655–684. {{PMID|11405571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research in [[chimpanzees]] by social psychologists [[David Premack]] and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and Woodruff, G. (1978). Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? Behav. Sci. 4: 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of [[cooperation]] and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S.

Theory of mind appears to be lacking in children with [[autism| autism spectrum disorders]], and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a [[developmental delay]] in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, "putting oneself in another person's shoes") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large [[social groups]]. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of [[human evolution]]: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt;

== Language ==
Though some (including Bates et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Thal, D., &amp; Marchman, V. (1991). Symbols and syntax: A Darwinian approach to language development. Biological and behavioral determinants of language development, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche. STUDIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, 3, 16–37.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, [[Steven Pinker]] argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and [[ontogeny]] of language. Pinker also uses the [[double dissociation]] between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]] but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt; Using language "multiplies the benefit of knowledge" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Arbib puts forth a hypothesis that [[mirror neurons]] in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;Arbib, M. A. (2005). From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(02), 105–124 {{PMID|16201457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these neurons in [[Broca's area]] in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities.&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative [[gestures]] (such as threat gestures and "food begs" among [[baboons]]) established a foundation on which to build human language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Meguerditchian, A., &amp; Vauclair, J. (2009). Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language. Brain and language, 108(3), 167–174. {{PMID|19091390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a [[hunting|hunt]], but recent research has focused on [[ecological]] theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a "social [[arms race]]" against non-human primates.&lt;ref name = Flinn&gt;Flinn, M. V., Geary, D. C., &amp; Ward, C. V. (2005). Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(1), 10–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful "intermediary stages," human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, [[syntax]]) can be spared in [[amnesia]], while other abilities (like [[memory]] retention) are drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="Fer"&gt;Ferreira, V. S., Bock, K., Wilson, M. P., &amp; Cohen, N. J. (2008). Memory for syntax despite amnesia. Psychological science, 19(9), 940–946. {{PMID|18947361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.&lt;ref name="Fer" /&gt;

=== Universal Grammar ===
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed a biological component of language, which he termed [[Universal Grammar]].&lt;ref name="Chom"&gt;Chomsky, N. (1972). Language and mind (p. 100). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).&lt;ref name="Chom" /&gt;  All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser; Noam Chomsky; W. Tecumseh Fitch (November 22, 2002). "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?". Science 298 (5598): 1569–1579. doi 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569. {{PMID|12446899}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a "pre-existing cognitive specialization":&lt;ref name="Jack"&gt;Jackendoff, R. (2001). Language in the ecology of mind. The Routledge companion to semiotics and linguistics, 52–65.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having [[vocabulary]] and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be [[genetically]] pre-disposed to ''learn'' language.&lt;ref name="Jack" /&gt; Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains,&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzen, Wolfram (September 2012). "The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar". Language Sciences 34 (5): 635–649. doi:10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
According to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. Nature, 437(7063), 1291–1298 {{PMID|16251955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. [[Gossip]], viewed by many &lt;ref name="gossip"&gt;Miller, G. (2011). The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature. Random House LLC. doi:10.1525/aa.2001.103.4.1196&lt;/ref&gt; to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] behaviors.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' [[social standing]], it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), [[linguists]] argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

== Other possible specializations ==
Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent [[humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, K. K., Matthews, B. J., &amp; Allman, J. M. (2007). Brain activation during sight gags and language-dependent humor. Cerebral Cortex, 17(2), 314–324. {{PMID|16514105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[adaptive]] value has both [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Frey, S. H. (2003). What's so special about human tool use?. Neuron, 39(2), 201–204. doi:10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00424-0 {{PMID|12873378}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced [[motor skill|sensorimotor]] skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in [[motor areas]] of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more [[philosophical]] level, Boyer (2003) argues that "[[religious]] thought and behavior" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2003). Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function. Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(3), 119–124. {{PMID|12639693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, F., McCabe, K., Moll, J., Kriegeskorte, N., Zahn, R., Strenziok, M., &amp; Grafman, J. (2007). Neural correlates of trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 20084–20089. doi 10.1073/pnas.0710103104 {{PMID|18056800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human specialization ==

=== In non-human primates ===
Humankind’s closest ancestors, the [[great apes]], have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: [[orangutans]] are specialists at climbing trees, while [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]] have evolved to walk on their knuckles.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the "profound continuity" [[Charles Darwin]] noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a "profound discontinuity" between human and non-human animal minds.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D. C., Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Povinelli, D. J. (2008). Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31(02), 109–130. {{PMID|18479531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the "[[mirror test]]").&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Heyes (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101–114. {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Eddy, T. J., Hobson, R. P., &amp; Tomasello, M. (1996). What young chimpanzees know about seeing. Monographs of the society for research in child development, i–189. doi 10.2307/1166159 {{PMID|8795292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhesus monkeys]] have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. (2001). Rhesus monkeys know when they remember. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(9), 5359–5362. doi 10.1073/pnas.071600998 {{PMID|11274360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other animals ===
More recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in [[primates]]: domesticated [[dogs]] may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, B., Tomasello, M. (2005) Human-like social skills in dogs?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 9, pages 439–444, ISSN 1364-6613 {{PMID|16061417}} doi 10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]] have also been shown to pass the "mirror test" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the [[Animal|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Marten, K. &amp; Psarakos, S.

[[File:Louis-Nicolas Clerambault.jpg|thumb|French composer [[Louis-Nicolas Clérambault]] composing at the keyboard]]
A '''composer''' ([[Latin]] [[wikt:compono|''compōnō'']]; literally "one who puts together") is a [[musician]] who is an [[author]] of [[music]] in any form, including [[vocal music]] (for a [[Singing|singer]] or [[choir]]), [[instrumental music]], [[electronic music]], and music which combines multiple forms. A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].

Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.

==Composers and performers==
Since [[musical notation]] only incompletely expresses a piece of music, there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert. Even in a classical piece of instrumental music in which all of the melodies, chords, and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a good degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work by varying her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.

A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]].

Music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom diminished in later eras, reflected in the increased use by composers of detailed notation, including marks of expression telling the performer more precisely how the work should be executed. A culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.

The [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a "cover" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness highly valued (with the possible exception of "note-for-note" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).

In Classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

==History==
The level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.

[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]
The term "composer" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].

===Ancient Greece===
Music was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written around 200 BC to around AD 100 {{sfn|Landels|1999|loc=252}} is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Aydın]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].

During the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.&lt;!--?--&gt; The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs).

During the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (1600 to 1750), composers expanded the range and complexity of the music they were writing. The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D.|publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[François Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].

===Classicism===

Composers of music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical Period]] (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.

Composers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

|}
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 "Incidental music"], Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.

===20th- and 21st-century music===
[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]
In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.

==Role of women==
{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
In 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993" /&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=; 11:04 AM &amp;bull; by Abbey Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt;

Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|title=WQXR – New York's Classical Music Radio Station|website=WQXR|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clustering==
Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history. Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' and using [[word count]] measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris has been the main hub for classical music in all periods. It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Training==
Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.

===Undergraduate===
Bachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.

===Masters===
Master of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.

===Doctoral===
To become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.

Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.

===Other routes===
Some classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.

==Employment==
During the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.

The '''Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈoːʁi̯ɛnt ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|lang}}, ''German Oriental Society''), abbreviated '''DOG''', is a [[Germany|German]] [[Eingetragener Verein|voluntary association]] based in [[Berlin]] dedicated to the study of the [[Near East]].

The DOG was officially founded in January 1898 to foster public interest in [[orient]]al [[antiquities]], and to promote related [[archaeology|archaeological]] research. It competed with similar bodies in France and England, and reflected an increased enthusiasm to learn about the [[Bible lands]] in the late 19th century.  DOG focused on the cultures of the [[Middle East]] from early times to the [[Islam]]ic period.

The founders of the DOG included a number of powerful, well-connected and wealthy members of German society, including [[Henri James Simon]] and banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]].  Their wealth enabled the DOG to undertake expensive excavations in the Middle East.  [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] developed an interest in archaeology, and took the DOG under his protection from 1901, funding excavations with grants from Imperial funds.  It was officially a subsidiary of the German museum administration, so its finds automatically belonged to the [[Prussia]]n state.  Its work was aided by friendly relations established between the German and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.
 
Work was interrupted by the [[World Wars]].  The DOG was reestablished in 1947, and celebrated its centennial at the [[Pergamon Museum]] in 1998.

==Excavations==
DOG undertook excavations in [[Babylon]] from 1899 to 1917, directed by [[Robert Koldewey]], uncovering the [[Ishtar Gate]], the palaces of [[Nebuchadnezzar]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].  Koldewey also claimed to have discovered the [[Tower of Babel]].

[[Ludwig Borchardt]] led DOG excavations in [[Egypt]] in 1902 at the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] of [[Abusir]] and then, from 1911 to 1914, at the ruins of [[Tell el-Amarna]], where the famous [[bust of Nefertiti]], now in Berlin's [[Ägyptisches Museum]], was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]].

[[Walter Andrae]] led DOG excavations at [[Assyria]]n capital of [[Assur]] from 1903 to 1914, and [[Hugo Winckler]] excavated at [[Boğazköy]] in Turkey from 1906 to 1911, uncovering the capital of the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Hattuša]].  Other excavations before the First World War took place at sites at across the [[Fertile Crescent]] - in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Turkey]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]] - including [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Capernaum]], [[Borsippa]], [[Hatra]], [[Jericho]], [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]], and [[Uruk]], but the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914 terminated DOG's excavations.

After the DOG was reestablished following the Second World War, more recent excavations have taken place at [[Habuba Kabira]] from 1969 to 1975, at Tall Munbāqa (also Ekalte ([[Mumbaqat]])) in northern [[Syria]] from 1969 to 2012, near Bogazköy from 1996 to 1999, [[Kuşaklı|Sarissa]] in 1995, [[Urkesh]] in 1998, and [[Qatna]] in 1999.

The DOG produces the annual publications, ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft'' (''MDOG'') and ''Alter Orient aktuell''.

It is generally seen as the mathematical equivalent to [[dyslexia]].

It can occur in people from across the whole [[IQ]] range – often higher than average – along with difficulties with time, measurement, and [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial reasoning]].&lt;ref name = "Butterworth, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Butterworth |first= B | year = 2010 | title = Foundational numerical capacities and the origins of dyscalculia |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 534–541 | pmid = 20971676 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Butterworth, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Butterworth |first1= B |last2= Varma |first2= S |last3= Laurillard |first3= D | year = 2011 | title = Dyscalculia: From brain to education | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 332 | issue = 6033 | pages = 1049–1053 | pmid = 21617068 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201536|bibcode= 2011Sci...332.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the prevalence of dyscalculia range between 3 and 6% of the population.&lt;ref name = "Butterworth, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Butterworth, 2011" /&gt; In 2015, it was established that 11% of children with dyscalculia also have ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soares, MD|first=Neelkamal|last2=Patel, MD, MBA|first2=Dilip R|year=2015|title=Dyscalculia|url=|journal=International Journal of Child and Adolescent Health|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyscalculia has also been associated with people who have [[Turner syndrome]] and people who have [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Learning Brain: Memory and Brain Development in Children|first=Torkel|last=Klingberg|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year=2013|isbn=9780199917105|page= 68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIqOLf3lnNYC&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical]] disabilities can occur as the result of some types of [[brain injury]], in which case the proper term, [[acalculia]], is to distinguish it from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.

== History ==
The term 'dyscalculia' was coined in the 1940s, but it was not completely recognized until 1974 by the work of [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakian]] researcher Ladislav Kosc. Kosc defined dyscalculia as "a structural disorder of mathematical abilities." His research proved that the learning disability was caused by impairments to certain parts of the brain that control mathematical calculations and not because symptomatic individuals were 'mentally handicapped'. Researchers now sometimes use the terms “math dyslexia” or “math learning disability” when they mention the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62436/11-facts-about-math-disorder-dyscalculia|title=11 Facts About the Math Disorder Dyscalculia|date=2015-04-06|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the [[multiplication table]]s). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]&lt;ref name="Dehaene1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics|last=Dehaene|first=S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-513240-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Butterworth]]&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2011" /&gt; as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in "[[number sense]]"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build. Symptoms of dyscalculia include the delay of simple counting, inability to memorize simple arithmetic facts such as adding, subtracting, etc. There are few known symptoms because little research has been done on the topic.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2011" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The earliest appearance of dyscalculia is typically a deficit in the ability to know, from a brief glance and without counting, how many objects there are in a small group (see [[subitizing]]). Children as young as 5 can subitize 6 objects, especially looking at a die. However, children with dyscalculia can subitize fewer objects and even when correct take longer to identify the number than their age-matched peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Subitizing and visual counting in children with problems in acquiring basic arithmetic skills | journal = Optometry &amp; Vision Development | year = 2008 | first1 = B  | last1 = Fischer |first2= C |last2= Gebhardt |first3=  K |last3= Hartnegg, | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–9 | url = http://www.lookingforlearning.com/abstracts/ovd39-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyscalculia often looks different at different ages. It tends to become more apparent as kids get older; however, symptoms can appear as early as preschool.&lt;ref&gt;Team, T. U. (n.d.). Understanding Dyscalculia. Retrieved September 02, 2017, from https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/dyscalculia/understanding-dyscalculia&lt;/ref&gt;Common symptoms of dyscalculia are, having difficulty with mental math, trouble analyzing time and reading an analog clock, struggle with motor sequencing that involves numbers, and often they will count on their fingers when adding numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/|title=What Does Dyscalculia Look Like in Adults?|date=2017-02-15|work=ADDitude|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence in children===
Although many researchers believe dyscalculia to be a persistent disorder, evidence on the persistence of dyscalculia remains mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kucian|last2=von Aster|title=Developmental Dyscalculia|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|date=2015|volume=174|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s00431-014-2455-7|pmid=25529864}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a study done by Mazzocco and Myers (2003), researchers evaluated children on a slew of measures and selected their most consistent measure as their best diagnostic criterion: a stringent 10th-percentile cut-off on the TEMA-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mozzocco|last2=Myers|title=Complexities in identifying and defining mathematics learning disability in the primary school-age years|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=2003|volume=53|issue=1|pages=218–253|doi=10.1007/s11881-003-0011-7|pmid=19750132|pmc=2742419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with their best criterion, they found dyscalculia diagnoses for children longitudinally did not persist; only 65% of students who were ever diagnosed over the course of four years were diagnosed for at least two years. The percentage of children who were diagnosed in two consecutive years was further reduced. It is unclear whether this was the result of misdiagnosed children improving in mathematics and spatial awareness as they progressed as normal, or that the subjects who showed improvement were accurately diagnosed, but exhibited signs of a non-persistent learning disability. 

=== Persistence in adults ===
There are very few studies about adults with dyscalculia that have had a history of it growing up, but these studies have shown that it can persist into adulthood. It can affect major parts of an adult's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attout, Salmon, Majerus|first=Lucie, Eric, Steve|date=2015|title=Working Memory for Serial Order Is Dysfunctional in Adults With a History of Developmental Dyscalculia: Evidence From Behavioral and Neuroimaging Data|url=|journal=Developmental Neuropychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Most adults with dyscalculia have a hard time processing math at a 4th grade level. For 1st-4th grade level, many adults will know what to do for the math problem, but they will often get them wrong because of "careless errors," although they are not careless when it comes to the problem. The adults cannot process their errors on the math problems or may not even recognize that they have made these errors. Visual-spatial input, auditory input, and touch input will be affected due to these processing errors. Dyscalculics may have a difficult time adding numbers in a column format because their mind can mix up the numbers, and it is possible that they may get the same answer twice due to their mind processing the problem incorrectly. Dyscalculics can have problems determining differences in different coins and their size or giving the correct amount of change and if numbers are grouped together, it is possible that they cannot determine which has less or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyscalculia.org/college-dyscalculia|title=College &amp; Dyscalculia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a dyscalculic is asked to choose the greater of two numbers, with the lesser number in a larger font than the greater number, they may take the question literally and pick the number with the bigger font.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=2013-01-09|title=Dyscalculia: Number games|url=https://www.nature.com/news/dyscalculia-number-games-1.12153|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=493|issue=7431|pages=150–153|doi=10.1038/493150a|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2013Natur.493..150C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with dyscalculia have a tough time with directions while driving and with controlling their finances, which causes difficulties on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/|title=What Does Dyscalculia Look Like in Adults?|last=Frye|first=Devon|date=2017-02-15|work=ADDitude|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====College students or other adult learners====
College students particularly may have a tougher time due to the fast pace and change in difficulty of the work they are given. As a result of this, students may develop a lot of anxiety and frustration. After dealing with their anxiety for a long time, students can become averse to math and try to avoid it as much as possible, which may result in lower grades in math courses. However, students with dyscalculia often do exceptionally in writing, reading, and speaking. Students may try to succeed through determination and persistence because of their inability to do well with numbers. They may try to keep a positive attitude even with the frustration and anxiety because they want to meet their goal in life. The problem, when it comes to college, is that professors cannot grade entirely on their persistence, determination, and efforts. Students need to figure out ways to overcome their difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyscalculia.org/college-dyscalculia|title=College &amp; Dyscalculia - Dyscalculia.org|website=www.dyscalculia.org|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a lot of services that schools can provide for students. In the 21st century there is evidence that there will be an increase in enrollment for students with learning disabilities in community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Disabilities and Employment|last=Rapp|first=Rhonda|publisher=pro-ed|year=1997|isbn=0-89079-717-X|editor-last=Gerber|editor-first=Paul|location=Austin, Texas|pages=104|chapter=Community College Programs: Their Role in Preparing Students with Learning Disabilities for Employment|editor-last2=Brown|editor-first2=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Both [[domain-general]] and [[domain-specific]] causes have been put forth. With respect to pure developmental dyscalculia, domain-general causes are unlikely as they should not impair one’s ability in the numerical domain without also affecting other domains such as reading.

Two competing domain-specific hypotheses about the causes of developmental dyscalculia have been proposed – the ''magnitude representation'' (or ''number module deficit hypothesis'') and the ''access deficit hypothesis''.

===Magnitude representation deficit===
Dehaene's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dehaene|first1=S.|title=Precis of the number sense|journal=Mind &amp; Language|date=2001|volume=16|issue=1|pages=16–36|doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00154}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[number sense]]" theory suggests that approximate numerosities are automatically ordered in an ascending manner on a mental number line. The mechanism to represent and process non-symbolic magnitude (e.g., number of dots) is often known as the "[[approximate number system]]" (ANS), and a core deficit in the precision of the ANS, known as the "magnitude representation hypothesis" or "number module deficit hypothesis", has been proposed as an underlying cause of developmental dyscalculia.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, B. (2005). Developmental dyscalculia. In J. I. D., Campbell (Ed.), Handbook of mathematical cognition (pp. 455–467). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In particular, the structural features of the ANS is theoretically supported by a phenomenon called the "numerical distance effect", which has been robustly observed in numerical comparison tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moyer|first1=R. S.|last2=Landauer|first2=T. K.|title=Time required for judgements of numerical inequality|journal=Nature|date=1967|volume=215|issue=5109|pages=1519–1520|doi=10.1038/2151519a0|pmid=6052760|bibcode=1967Natur.215.1519M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically developing individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers closer together (e.g., 7 and 8) than further apart (e.g., 2 and 9). A related "numerical ratio effect" (in which the ratio between two numbers varies but the distance is kept constant, e.g., 2 vs. 5 and 4 vs. 7) based on the [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]] has also been used to further support the structure of the ANS.&lt;ref name=Halberda2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halberda|first1=J.|last2=Mazzocco|first2=M. M. M.|last3=Feigenson|first3=L.|title=Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement|journal=Nature|date=2008|volume=455|issue=7213|pages=665–668|doi=10.1038/nature07246|pmid=18776888|bibcode=2008Natur.455..665H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical ratio effect is observed when individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers that have a larger ratio (e.g., 8 and 9, ratio = 8/9) than a smaller ratio (2 and 3; ratio = 2/3). A larger numerical distance or ratio effect with comparison of sets of objects (i.e., non-symbolic) is thought to reflect a less precise ANS, and the ANS acuity has been found to correlate with math achievement in typically developing children &lt;ref name=Halberda2008 /&gt; and also in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halberda|first1=J.|last2=Ly|first2=R.|last3=Wilmer|first3=J. B.|last4=Naiman|first4=D. Q.|last5=Germine|first5=L.|title=Number sense across the lifespan as revealed by a massive Internet-based sample|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2012|volume=109|issue=28|pages=11116–11120|doi=10.1073/pnas.1200196109|bibcode=2012PNAS..10911116H|pmid=22733748|pmc=3396479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, several behavioral studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashkenazi|first1=S.|last2=Mark-Zigdon|first2=N.|last3=Henik|first3=A.|title=Numerical distance effect in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Cognitive Development|date=2009|volume=24|issue=4|pages=387–400|doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussolin|first1=C.|last2=Mejias|first2=S.|last3=Noël|first3=M. P.|title=Symbolic and nonsymbolic number comparison in children with and without dyscalculia|journal=Cognition|date=2010|volume=115|issue=1|pages=10–25|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2009.10.006|pmid=20149355}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that children with developmental dyscalculia show an attenuated distance/ratio effect than typically developing children. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have also provided additional insights even when behavioral difference in distance/ratio effect might not be clearly evident. For example, Price and colleagues&lt;ref name=Price2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=G. R.|last2=Holloway|first2=I.|last3=Räsänen|first3=P.|last4=Vesterinen|first4=M.|last5=Ansari|first5=D.|title=Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Current Biology|date=2007|volume=17|issue=24|pages=1042–1043|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.013|pmid=18088583}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children with developmental dyscalculia showed no differential distance effect on reaction time relative to typically developing children, but they did show a greater effect of distance on response accuracy. They also found that the right [[intraparietal sulcus]] in children with developmental dyscalculia was not modulated to the same extent in response to non-symbolic numerical processing as in typically developing children.&lt;ref name=Price2007 /&gt; With the robust implication of the intraparietal sulcus in magnitude representation, it is possible that children with developmental dyscalculia have a weak magnitude representation in the parietal region. Yet, it does not rule out an impaired ability to access and manipulate numerical quantities from their symbolic representations (e.g., Arabic digits).
[[File:Gray726 parietal lobe.png|thumb|This shows the part of the brain where the sulcus is located in the parietal lobe.]]
Moreover, findings from a cross-sectional study suggest that children with developmental dyscalculia might have a delayed development in their numerical magnitude representation by as much as five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=M.|last2=Facoetti|first2=A.|last3=Trussardi|first3=A. N.|last4=Berteletti|first4=I.|last5=Conte|first5=S.|last6=Lucangeli|first6=D.|last7=Dehaene|first7=S.|last8=Zorzi|first8=M.|title=Developmental trajectory of number acuity reveals a severe impairment in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Cognition|date=2010|volume=116|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.03.012|pmid=20381023}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of longitudinal studies still leaves the question open as to whether the deficient numerical magnitude representation is a delayed development or impairment.

===Access deficit hypothesis===

Rousselle &amp; Noël&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousselle|first1=L.|last2=Noel|first2=M.P.|title=Basic numerical skills in children with mathematics learning disabilities: A comparison of symbolic vs. non-symbolic number magnitude|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|pages=361–395|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.005|pmid=16488405}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose that dyscalculia is caused by the inability to map preexisting representations of numerical magnitude onto symbolic Indian digits. Evidence for this hypothesis is based on research studies that have found that individuals with dyscalculia are proficient on tasks that measure knowledge of non-symbolic numerical magnitude (i.e., non-symbolic comparison tasks) but show an impaired ability to process symbolic representations of number (i.e., symbolic comparison tasks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Smedt|first1=B.|last2=Gilmore|first2=C.K.|title=Defective number module or impaired access? Numerical magnitude processing in first graders with mathematical difficulties|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=2011|volume=108|issue=2|pages=278–292|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroimaging|Neuroimaging studies]] also report increased activation in the right [[intraparietal sulcus]] during tasks that measure symbolic but not non-symbolic processing of numerical magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussolin|first1=C.|last2=De Volder|first2=A.|last3=Grandin|first3=C.|last4=Schlögel|first4=X.|last5=Nassogne|first5=M.C.|last6=Noël|first6=M.P.|title=Neural correlates of symbolic number comparison in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=860–874|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21237}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, support for the access deficit hypothesis is not consistent across research studies.&lt;ref name=Price2007/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
At its most basic level, dyscalculia is a learning disability affecting the normal development of arithmetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shalev|first1=Ruth|title=Developmental Dyscalculia|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|date=2004|volume=49|issue=11|pages=868–873|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2007.00868.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus has not yet been reached on appropriate diagnostic criteria for dyscalculia.&lt;ref name="Berch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berch, Mozacco|title=Why Is Math So Hard for Some Children? The Nature and Origins of Mathematical Learning Difficulties and Disabilities|journal=Brookes Publishing Company|date=2007|pages=416|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED494995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics is a specific domain that is complex (i.e. includes many different processes, such as arithmetic, algebra, word problems, geometry, etc.) and cumulative (i.e. the processes build on each other such that mastery of an advanced skill requires mastery of many basic skills). Thus dyscalculia can be diagnosed using different criteria, and frequently is; this variety in diagnostic criteria leads to variability in identified samples, and thus variability in research findings regarding dyscalculia.
[[File:Examples of the numerical stroop effect trials.jpg|thumb|305x305px|It show the example of each condition in the numerical stroop effect task]]
Other than using achievement tests as diagnostic criteria, researchers often rely on domain-specific tests (i.e. tests of working memory, executive function, inhibition, intelligence, etc.) and teacher evaluations to create a more comprehensive diagnosis. Alternatively, fMRI research has shown that the brains of the [[neurotypical]] children can be reliably distinguished from the brains of the dyscalculic children based on the activation in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinkel|title=Diagnosing Developmental Dyscalculia on the Basis of Reliable Single Case FMRI Methods: Promises and Limitations|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083722|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...883722D|pages=e83722|pmid=24349547|pmc=3857322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the cost and time limitations associated with brain and neural research, these methods will likely not be incorporated into diagnostic criteria despite their effectiveness.

===Types===
Research on subtypes of dyscalculia has begun without consensus; preliminary research has focused on comorbid learning disorders as subtyping candidates.

* '''Semantic memory''':  This subtype often coexists with reading disabilities such as [[dyslexia]] and is characterized by poor representation and retrieval from [[long-term memory]].

This has been observed in individuals with [[Gerstmann syndrome]], of which dyscalculia is one of constellation of symptoms.
* '''Procedural concepts''':  Research by Geary has shown that in addition to increased problems with fact retrieval, children with math disabilities may rely on immature computational strategies.  Specifically, children with mathematical disabilities showed poor command of counting strategies unrelated to their ability to retrieve numeric facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geary|first1=DC|title=A componential analysis of an early learning deficit in mathematics|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1990|volume=49|issue=3|pages=363383|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(90)90065-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research notes that it is difficult to discern whether poor conceptual knowledge is indicative of a qualitative deficit in number processing or simply a delay in typical mathematical development.

However, working memory problems are confounded with domain-general learning difficulties, thus these deficits may not be specific to dyscalculia but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit.  Dysfunction in prefrontal regions may also lead to deficits in working memory and other executive function, accounting for comorbidity with ADHD.&lt;ref name=Shalev /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubinsten2009 /&gt;
 
Studies have also shown indications of causes due to [[congenital]] or [[hereditary disorder]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid15727331"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monuteaux |first1= MC |last2= Faraone |first2= SV |last3= Herzig |first3= K |last4= Navsaria |first4= N |last5= Biederman |first5= J |displayauthors= 4 |title=ADHD and dyscalculia: Evidence for independent familial transmission |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=86–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15727331 |doi= 10.1177/00222194050380010701|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15727331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but evidence of this is not yet concrete.

As such, instruction time in the classroom is necessarily limited. For this reason, several research groups have developed computer adaptive training programs designed to target deficits unique to dyscalculic individuals.

Several digital interventions have been developed for dyscalculics specifically. Each attempts to target basic processes that are associated with maths difficulties. Rescue Calcularis was one early computerized intervention that sought to improve the integrity of and access to the mental number line.&lt;ref name="Kucian, K. 2011"/&gt; Other digital interventions for dyscalculia adapt games, flash cards, and manipulables to function through technology.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2010"/&gt;

While each intervention claims to improve basic numerosity skills, the authors of these interventions do admit that repetition and practice effects may be a factor involved in reported performance gains.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kucian, K. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Räsänen, P."/&gt; An additional criticism is that these digital interventions lack the option to manipulate numerical quantities.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2011"/&gt; While the previous two games provide the correct answer, the individual using the intervention cannot actively determine, through manipulation, what the correct answer should be. Butterworth and colleagues argued that games like The Number Bonds, which allows an individual to compare different sized rods, should be the direction that digital interventions move towards. Such games use manipulation activities to provide intrinsic motivation towards content guided by dyscalculia research. One of these [[serious game]]s is [[Meister Cody – Talasia]], an online training that includes the [[CODY Assessment]] – a diagnostic test for detecting dyscalculia. Based on these findings, Rescue Calcluaris was extended by adaptation algorithms and game forms allowing manipulation by the learners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Käser|first=Tanja|last2=Baschera|first2=Gian-Marco|last3=Kohn|first3=Juliane|last4=Kucian|first4=Karin|last5=Richtmann|first5=Verena|last6=Grond|first6=Ursina|last7=Gross|first7=Markus|last8=von Aster|first8=Michael|date=2013-01-01|title=Design and evaluation of the computer-based training program Calcularis for enhancing numerical cognition|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00489/full|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=4|pages=489|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00489|pmc=3733013|pmid=23935586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauscher|first=Larissa|last2=Kohn|first2=Juliane|last3=Käser|first3=Tanja|last4=Mayer|first4=Verena|last5=Kucian|first5=Karin|last6=McCaskey|first6=Ursina|last7=Esser|first7=Günter|last8=von Aster|first8=Michael|date=2016-01-01|title=Evaluation of a Computer-Based Training Program for Enhancing Arithmetic Skills and Spatial Number Representation in Primary School Children|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00913/full|journal=Developmental Psychology|pages=913|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00913|pmc=4921479|pmid=27445889|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found to improve addition, subtraction and number line tasks, and was made available as Dybuster Calcularis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Käser|first=T.|last2=Busetto|first2=A.

==Etymology==
The term ''dyscalculia'' dates back to at least 1949.&lt;ref name="Pollak2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trott |first=Clare |editor-first=David |editor-last= Pollak|title=Neurodiversity in Higher Education: Positive Responses to Specific Learning Differences |chapter=Dyscalculia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVhQoqboi1UC&amp;pg=PA125 |date=5 March 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99753-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kosc, Ladislav|year=1974|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/3/164|title=Developmental dyscalculia|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=7|number=3|pages=159–62|doi=10.1177/002221947400700309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyscalculia comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and means "counting badly". The prefix "''dys-''" comes from Greek and means "badly". The root "''calculia''" comes from the Latin "''calculare''", which means "[[counting|to count]]" and which is also related to "[[calculation]]" and "[[calculus]]".

The '''fair trade debate''' is a debate around alleged issues with the [[Fairtrade]] brand. The debate surrounds the ethics and alleged economic implications of [[fair trade]]. Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as Fair Trade was actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–573|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/REST_a_00512|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L.

== Ethical basis of criticisms==

Although there is evidence to suggest that consumers buy fair trade goods for a variety of reasons, some are willing to pay more for Fairtrade certified products – for example, in the belief that this helps the very poor.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Niemi, N. (2010). "Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers." Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270; Trudel, R., &amp; Cotte, J. (2009). Does it pay to be good? MIT Sloan Management Review. , Winter; Arnot, C., Boxall, P., &amp; Cash, S. (2006). Do ethical consumers care about price? A revealed preference analysis of Fair Trade coffee purchases. Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 54: 555–565.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the [[Fairtrade]] brand have argued against the system on an ethical basis, stating that the system diverts profits from the poorest farmers, and that the profit is received by corporate firms. It has been argued that this causes "death and destitution".&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite journal|author=Griffiths, P.|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=105|issue=3|pages=357|date=July 2011|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Ethical%20Objections%20to%20Fairtrade%20web.pdf|publisher=www.springerlink.com}} Accessed at [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Why Fairtrade isn't fair].&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used as evidence to doubt that much of the extra money paid reaches farmers, and that there is reason to believe that Fairtrade harms non-Fairtrade farmers. There are criticisms that false claims made for fair trade and the withholding of relevant information constitute Unfair Trading under EU law. There are also criticisms using many other criteria.&lt;ref name=Many&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) "Half a Cheer for Fair Trade", Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; {{cite journal|author=Griffiths, P.|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=105|issue=3|pages=357|date=July 2011|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Ethical%20Objections%20to%20Fairtrade%20web.pdf|publisher=www.springerlink.com}} Accessed at [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Why Fairtrade isn't fair]

Fair Trade: Benefits and Drawbacks for Producers. Puente @ Europa - , Año IV, Número 2 - Junio 2006, 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, pro-Fairtrade researcher Alastair Smith claims that while some of these criticisms are grounded in acceptable standards of evidence (and deserve serious attention), others are less well elaborated, and that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=A Response to the Adam Smith Report &amp; A New Way to Think About Measuring the Content of the Fair Trade Cup Alastair|journal=Comment and Analysis|year=2008|url=http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/TheFairTradeCupResponsetoAdamSmithD9_1.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a few cases, the criticisms presented are assertions with little or no credible evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=Fair Trade, Diversification and Structural Change: Towards a broader theoretical framework of analysis|journal=Oxford Development Studies|year=2008|volume=37|issue=4|pages=457–478|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/6918/|doi=10.1080/13600810903305208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims have themselves been criticized on matters of fact, theory, methodology, use of evidence and incorrect citations.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|45–49}}&lt;ref name=Rejoinder&gt;Griffiths, P.: 2011, [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm "Rejoinder: False Statements, Misrepresentation and Distortion in Defending Fairtrade"], Economic Affairs, 103–4.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==What happens to the money==

=== Little money reaches the developing world ===

The evidence available suggests that little of the extra money paid by consumers actually reaches the farmers. [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much more money retailers charge for Fairtrade goods. Furthermore, retailers almost never sell identical Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade lines side by side, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers in spite of Unfair Trading legislation.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005L0029:EN:HTML Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;   In a very few cases, it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics, 97:257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;  found that consumers paid much more for Fairtrade, and that only 11.5% of that reached the exporter. Kilian, Jones, Pratt and Villalobos&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; talk of US Fairtrade coffee getting $5 per lb extra at retail, of which the exporter would have received only 2%. Mendoza and Bastiaensen&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). "Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias." Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt; calculated that in the UK only 1.6% to 18% of the extra charged for one product line reached the farmer. Critics claim that many counter-examples would be needed to show that these are not typical. Since Fairtrade charges a 1.9% licensing fee at wholesale, the maximum that reaches the developing world, even if traders charge unrealistically low margins, is 50%, and a much smaller amount would reach the target farmers.

=== Less money reaches farmers===

The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs in meeting the Fairtrade political standards, and possibly costs arising from the monopoly power of the cooperative. Farmers also incur additional production costs on all of their production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. Over the years, Fairtrade producers have only been able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified, selling the rest without certification at world prices.  While both proponents and opponents of Fairtrade acknowledge this problem,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C. E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there are scarce economic studies presenting the actual revenues of Fairtrade cooperatives and how they spend their money. Weber (2006) examined the additional marketing costs of some cooperatives and found, for example, that '.  .  . after six years Oro Verde can cover only 70 percent of its [additional marketing] costs with its current income stream' and that the cooperative needs to double its current annual export volume in order to sustain its management team. At the time they were losing money on their Fairtrade membership.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. (2006). Rationing in the Fair Trade Coffee Market: Who enters and How? International colloquium on fair trade and sustainable development. Montreal: Ecole des Sciences de la Gestion, Universite du Quebec.&lt;/ref&gt; FLO figures&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International.: 2010, [http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf Annual Report 2009-2010]. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; show that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on 'business and production', which includes the costs mentioned above as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

There is no evidence that Fairtrade farmers get higher prices on average {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Some anecdotes state farmers are paid more by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives and some state that they were paid less. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65-69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on Third World market information systems is given at http://www.sim2g.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of different price packages. A different price package may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they may pay more or less than traders, depending on the day. Bassett (2009) &lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] ginneries, which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs of producing Fairtrade. For instance, when Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, they earned a higher price per pound but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics, 68 3018-3025; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that Fairtrade guarantees a 'fair price' for the producer is not supported by the evidence and although it is possible that Fair Trade may do so on occasions, there is no reason to believe that this is normal.

=== Lack of evidence of impact===
Some critics argue that there have been very few fair trade impact studies. Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; says that very few of the attempts made meet the normal standards for an [[impact evaluation]], such as comparing the before and after situation, having meaningful control groups, allowing for the fact that Fairtrade recruits farmers who are already better off, allowing for the fact that a Fairtrade cooperative receives aid from a dozen other organizations – government departments, aid agencies, donor countries, and NGOs, and allowing for the fact that Fairtrade may harm other farmers. Other serious methodological problems arise in sampling, in comparing prices, and from the fact that the social projects of Fairtrade do not usually aim to produce economic benefits.

Indeed, due to the snapshot nature of research, few studies include how long producers have been involved with fair trade. A further significant problem is that most studies ignore the agency and perspective of producer decision makers, especially the farmers excluded from the Fairtrade system. Capturing such socially constructed benefit, including that of confidence in business relationships, is notoriously difficult to capture in social science research.

An important distinction when discussing Fairtrade is the difference between impact studies and case studies.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|40–96}} Case studies are valuable for, among other things, researching specific systems and sub-systems, for constructing models, and for identifying problems. However, the impacts noted cannot be extrapolated generally. For instance, if a hundred dairy farms lose money, this does not mean that all or most dairy farms do. There are a lot of case studies on Fairtrade, but many are erroneously referred to as impact studies.

An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;
Nelson, V., &amp; Pound, B.: 2009, [http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade"].&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have found only 33 studies that met their criteria for impact studies (which accept studies that would not be acceptable to the World Bank etc.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Angelucci, M., &amp; Di Maro, V. (2010). Project Evaluation and Spillover Effects. Impact Evaluation Guidelines. Washington, DC: Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-136 (Inter-American Development Bank). Accessed at the [http://www-personal.umich.edu/ U-M Personal World Wide Web server];  Clemens, M. A., &amp; Demombynes, G. (2010). When Does Rigorous Impact Evaluation Make a Difference? The Case of the Millennium Villages. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 5477; Winters, P., Maffioli, A., &amp; Salazar, L. (2011). Introduction to the Special Feature: Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Projects in Developing Countries. Journal of Agricultural Economics , vol. 62, no. 2, 393–402 {{doi|10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00296.x}}; Winters, P., Salazar, L., &amp; Maffioli, A. (2010).

Washington DC: Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-198. (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; for instance). These included unpublished undergraduate and masters' dissertations, unpublished theses, journalistic articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. Griffiths (2011) claims that most of these reports had significant methodological weaknesses, and that few, if any, met the normal criteria for impact studies. Further, most of the cases studied were atypical.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

== Inefficient marketing system ==
One reason for low prices is that Fairtrade farmers are forced to sell through a [[Monopsony|monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and [[overproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Lindsey. (2004). [http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf Grounds for Complaint]. URL accessed on September 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes good are over produced and a fair trade product will be sold in a non fair trade market. If consumers find out they will not want to pay the premium for fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A. (2015). Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool? The review of economics and statistics, 97(3), 567-573&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption===

Low prices may also occur because the Fair Trade marketing system provides more opportunities for corruption than the normal marketing system, and less possibility of, or incentive for, controlling it. Corruption has been noted in false labelling of coffee as Fairtrade by retailers and by packers in the developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, September 8).

== Fairtrade helps the rich==

Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries. It is also aimed at richer farmers: in order to join Fairtrade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skillful, educated and well capitalized, and critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far from the poorest farmers. The majority of Fairtrade suppliers are in the higher income or middle income developing countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in the poorest countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per head of Sierra Leone, and very much larger coffee farms. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is $3 a day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, very much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Again, critics say this is diverting money from the poorest farmers.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

==Fairtrade harms other farmers==

===The overproduction argument===

Critics argue that Fairtrade, but not all other Fair Trade businesses, harm all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on better techniques, both of which will lead to increased output being sold on the global market. Economists&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P. (2008) 'Why Fairtrade Isn't Fair', Prospect, August Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.; Brink, Lindsey. (2004).

In addition, the Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, and particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists. This argument is often illustrated with the example of Vietnam paying its coffee farmers over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Rigour&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peter|first=Griffiths|title=Lack of rigour in defending Fairtrade: a reply to Alastair Smith|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=31|pages=103–104|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02058.x|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Lack%20of%20rigour%20in%20defending%20fairtrade.pdf|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith (2010) questioned the relevance of the Vietnam example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Fairtrade|title=Lack of Rigour on Defending Fairtrade: Some important clarrifications of a distorting account – a reply to Perter Griffiths|journal=Economic Affairs|year=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=50–53|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02011.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths published a sharp rejoinder.&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt;

The overproduction argument depends on the assumption that there is a significant increase in prices paid to Fairtrade farmers. The argument falls away if, as Fairtrade Labelling Organization&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International. (2013). [http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html Coffee]. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International.&lt;/ref&gt; and critics state, farmers do not get a higher price. This is not much of a defence however since saying only one of two serious flaws is possible at any one time still means the system is flawed.

===Counter-argument===
Key principles of fair trade include transparency and capacity building. ([[World Fair Trade Organization|WFTO]] Fair trade principles). Particularly in the developing world, it is very common for small-scale farmers to have only one or two buyers for their commodity products.  Prices thus can be set by the buyers along with quality criteria.  Normally buyers do not provide transparency as to the weighing and grading of product.  Unless the buyers are linked to a quality supply chain (such as a fair trade or organic supply chain), the buyers normally do not provide any capacity building as to how to improve the quality of the product and thus gain a higher price.  Fair trade when practiced well must provide full transparency in terms of pricing, weighing, and quality standards.   Also as the end goal is a superior quality product in all ways, good fair trade organizations provide good capacity building in terms of best production, harvest, and post-harvest practices.  From my personal experience (with Green Net, Thailand) and helping many other farmer groups to develop along this path in the region, it is clear that when one honest and transparent buyer enters the local market, it forces other buyers to be more honest and transparent.  Additionally in communities where farmers talk to each other (regardless of whether one is a member of a fair trade group or not), I have witnessed that there is knowledge transfer.  Thus non-fair trade farmers may and often do improve their production, harvest, and post-harvest practices, yielding a higher quality product, which merits a higher price.  This combined with a freer and more transparent market, thanks to the entry of a buyer (the fair trade buyer), means that non-fair trade farmers now are much more likely to be paid for the quality of their products and at the real market prices.

S. (2002). Fighting the tide: alternative trade organizations in the era of global free trade. World Development, 30(6), 949–958.&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of this, both using what they agree is an unrealistic model.

===Diverting aid from other farmers===
Fairtrade supporters boast of 'The Honeypot Effect' – that cooperatives which become Fairtrade members then attract additional aid from other NGO charities, government and international donors as a result of their membership.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting, K. (2009). Assessing the impact of Fair Trade Coffee: Towards an Integrative Framework. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:127-149. p. 141 ; Murray, D., Raynolds, L., &amp; Taylor, P. (2003).

Ecological Economics, 68 p. 3024&lt;/ref&gt; Typically there are now six to twelve other donors. Critics point out that this inevitably means that resources are being removed from other, poorer, farmers. It also makes it impossible to argue that any positive or negative changes in the living standards of farmers are due to Fairtrade rather than to one of the other donors.

==Other ethical issues==

===Secretiveness ===

Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) advertising or selling information 'contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.'&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; points to false claims that Fairtrade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failures to disclose the extra price charged for Fairtrade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-Fairtrade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries, which is, again, a criminal offence.

===Imposing one's politics===

The Fairtrade criteria presuppose a set of political values as to what economic, environmental, and social problems exist and how they are to be solved. Some critics state that it is unethical to bribe developing world producers to act according to political viewpoints that they may not agree with, and the consumers providing the money may not agree with. These critics also state that the unorthodox marketing system imposed, aiming to replace capitalism, may not tie in with the objectives of producers, consumers, importers or retailers.&lt;ref name=Many/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boersma, F. (2009). The urgency and necessity of a different type of market: the perspective of producers organized within the Fair Trade market. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:51-61; Boersma, F. V. (2002). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup Poverty Alleviation through Participation in Fair Trade Coffee Networks: The Case of UCIRI, Oaxaca, Mexico].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Audebrand, L., &amp; Pauchant, T.

=== Unethical selling techniques ===

Booth says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, misleading and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) "Half a Cheer for Fair Trade", Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Booth, P. (2008). [http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437 The Economics of Fairtrade: a Christian perspective]. London: Institute of Economic Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Smith, Sally|displayauthors=etal|url=http://projects.nri.org/nret/idswp223.pdf|title=Ethical Trade in African Horticulture: Gender, Rights and Participation|year=2004|isbn=1-85864-833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way?

=== Misleading volunteers ===

A lot of people volunteer to work to support Fairtrade. They may do unpaid work for firms, or market Fairtrade in schools, universities, local governments or parliament. Sometimes they do not appreciate that most or all the benefit may go to businesses in rich countries. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, "Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies", Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; report that Day Chocolate "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

===Failure to monitor standards===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes imposing months of additional work for little return.&lt;ref&gt;Utting-Chamorro, K. (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, 15(3, 4); Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement."

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamel, I.|year=2006|title=Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play|publisher=Swiss Info |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232|accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name=Hamel/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.

Ecological Economics, 68, 3018-3025.&lt;/ref&gt; "some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced";&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D.: 2009, 'What do Corporations have to do with Fair Trade? Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3-26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and supermarkets may avoid their responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, "The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective",  Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329-352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name=Weitzman/&gt;

== Trade justice and fair trade==

Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger impact on disadvantaged producers' lives. [[France|French]] author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;Boris, Jean-Pierre. (2005). Commerce inéquitable. Hachette Littératures. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political objections==

There have been largely political criticisms of Fairtrade, both from the left and the right.
Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. [[France|French]] author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquiau, Christian. (2006). Les Coulisses du Commerce Équitable. Éditions Mille et Une Nuits. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–296&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the criticisms of Fairtrade from the free market approach to economics appear to be linked to right wing political approaches, but this does not mean that their analysis in this particular case is unacceptable to mainstream economists.

{{anthropology of religion|Basic}}
A '''fetish''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] ''fétiche''; which comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''feitiço''; and this in turn from [[Latin]] ''facticius'', "artificial" and ''facere'', "to make") is an object believed to have [[supernatural]] powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the [[emic]] attribution of inherent value or powers to an object.

==Historiography==
The term "fetish" has evolved from an idiom used to describe a type of objects created in the interaction between European travelers and Africans in the early modern period to an analytical term that played a central role in the perception and study of non-Western art in general and African art in particular.

William Pietz, who conducted an extensive ethno-historical study of the fetish, argues that the term originated in the coast of [[West Africa]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, "fetish", an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, to which the term above applies.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=African objects and the idea of fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1994|volume=25|pages=123–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pietz, the [[post-colonial]] concept of "fetish" emerged from the encounter between Europeans and Africans in a very specific historical context and in response to African material culture.

He begins his polemic with an introduction to the complex history of the word:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My argument, then, is that the fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the ideology of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two radically different types of noncapitalist society, as they encountered each other in an ongoing cross-cultural situation. This process is indicated in the history of the word itself as it developed from the late medieval Portuguese ''feitiço'', to the sixteenth-century pidgin ''Fetisso'' on the African coast, to various northern European versions of the word via the 1602 text of the Dutchman Pieter de Marees... The fetish, then, not only originated from, but remains specific to, the problem of the social value of material objects as revealed in situations formed by the encounter of radically heterogeneous social systems, and a study of the history of the idea of the fetish may be guided by identifying those themes that persist throughout the various discourses and disciplines that have appropriated the term.&lt;ref name="Pietz 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, I|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1985|volume=9|pages=5–17|jstor=20166719|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stallybrass concludes that "Pietz shows that the fetish as a concept was elaborated to demonize the supposedly arbitrary attachment of West Africans to material objects. The European subject was constituted in opposition to a demonized fetishism, through the disavowal of the object."&lt;ref name="Stallybrass 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stallybrass|first=Peter|title=Consumption : critical concepts in the social sciences|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415242673|edition=1. publ.|authorlink=Marx's Coat|editor=Daniel Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious cults by West African natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Open University|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=August 2016}} The contemporary Portuguese ''feitiço'' may refer to more neutral terms such as charm, enchantment, juju or abracadabra, or more potentially offensive terms such as witchcraft, witchery, conjuration or bewitchment.

The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when [[Charles de Brosses]] used it in comparing [[West Africa]]n religion to the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al aspects of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Later, [[Auguste Comte]] employed the concept in his theory of the [[evolution theory|evolution]] of [[religion]], wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by [[polytheism]] and [[monotheism]]. However, [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] would classify some artifacts of monotheistic religions as fetishes. For example, the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and the [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] or tokens of communion found in some forms of [[Christianity]] (a monotheistic religion), are here regarded as examples of fetishism.

The eighteenth-century intellectuals who articulated the theory of fetishism encountered this notion in descriptions of "Guinea" contained in such popular voyage collections as Ramusio's ''Viaggio e Navigazioni'' (1550), de Bry's ''India Orientalis'' (1597), Purchas's ''Hakluytus Posthumus'' (1625), [[Awnsham Churchill|Churchill]]'s ''Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1732), [[Thomas Astley|Astley]]'s ''A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1746), and Prevost's ''Histoire generale des voyages'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Pietz 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, II: The Origin of the Fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1987|volume=13|pages=23–45|jstor=20166762|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of fetishism was consecrated at the end of the eighteenth century by [[G.W.F Hegel]] in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''. According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with imaginary powers.&lt;ref name=Astonishment&amp;Power&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=Astonishment &amp; Power, The Eyes of Understanding: Kongo Minkisi|year=1993|publisher=National Museum of African Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Tylor and McLennan, historians of religion, held that the concept of fetishism fostered a shift of attention away from the relationship between people and [[God]], to focus instead on a relationship between people and material objects, and that this, in turn, allowed for the establishment of false models of [[causality]] for natural events. This they saw as a central problem historically and sociologically.

In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] published his essay on "Fetishism", in which he writes that the meaning and purpose of the fetish turns out, through analysis, to always be the same: "the fetish is a substitute for the penis...for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost." In refusing to see his mother's lack of penis, the boy [[Denial|disavows]] (German: ''Verleugnung'', not repression: ''Verdrängung'') what he sees, resulting in both a belief and a non-belief in the woman's phallus. This compromise (produced by the conflict between perception and the counter-wish) results in a substitute (the fetish). "It remains a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it."

The use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional [[West Africa]]n religious beliefs, as well as from [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]], which in turn derives from those beliefs.

Fetishes were commonly used in [[Native American religion]] and practices.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;"Animals: fact and folklore," ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'', August 2008, pp. 56-63, see [http://www.nmmagazine.com/ New Mexico magazine website].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bear]] represented the [[shaman]], the [[American Bison|buffalo]] was the provider, the [[mountain lion]] was the warrior, and the [[wolf]] was the pathfinder.&lt;ref name=NM /&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

==''Minkisi''==
Made and used by the [[Kongo people|BaKongo]] people of western [[Zaire]], a ''[[nkisi]]'' (plural ''minkisi'') is a sculptural object that provides a local habitation for a spiritual personality. Though some minkisi have always been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less naturalistic or "realistic" before the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century; Kongo figures are more naturalistic in the coastal areas than inland.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt; As Europeans tend to think of spirits as objects of worship, idols become the objects of idolatry when worship was addressed to false gods. In this way, Europeans regarded ''minkisi'' as idols on the basis of false assumptions.

Europeans often called nkisi "fetishes" and sometimes "[[Cult image|idols]]" because they are sometimes rendered in human form. Modern anthropology has generally referred to these objects either as "power objects" or as "charms".

In addressing the question of whether a ''nkisi'' is a fetish, William McGaffey writes that the Kongo ritual system as a whole,

&lt;blockquote&gt;bears a relationship similar to that which Marx supposed that "political economy" bore to capitalism as its "religion", but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally "animate" character of the ritual system's symbolic apparatus, including ''minkisi'', divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. "Fetishism" is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, McGaffey concludes, to call a ''minkisi'' a fetish is to translate "certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-enlightenment Europe."&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;

==Secular fetishism==
The 19th century saw the introduction of two theories of fetishism outside what was typically considered religion. The first was [[Karl Marx]]'s idea of [[commodity fetishism]], in which the social relationships involved in production are experienced not as relationships among people, but as value-relationships between things (commodities – including labour – and money). The second was [[Alfred Binet]]'s term [[sexual fetishism]], the sexual attachment to an object in place of a person.

'''Figured bass''', or '''thoroughbass''', is a kind of [[musical notation]] in which numerals and symbols (often [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]) indicate [[interval (music)|intervals]], [[chord (music)|chord]]s, and [[non-chord tone]]s that a musician playing [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]] (or other instruments capable of playing chords) play in relation to the bass note that these numbers and symbols appear above or below. Figured bass is closely associated with [[#Basso continuo|basso continuo]], a historically improvised [[accompaniment]] used in almost all genres of music in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] of [[Classical music]] ({{circa}}1600–1750), though rarely in modern music.

==Basso continuo==&lt;!--[[Basso continuo]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600–1750), provided the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music. The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.

The makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers, and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments which play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ for [[sacred music]]. Typically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.

The keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Basso continuo, though an essential structural and identifying element of the Baroque period, continued to be used in many works, mostly (but not limited to) sacred choral works, of the [[Classical music era|classical]] period (up to around 1800).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thegreathistoryofarts.weebly.com/classical-era.html Classical Era (1750-1820)]", ''TheGreatHistoryofArts.Weebly.com''. Accessed: 27 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Source emphasizes the rapid decline of continuo practice in the Classical Era, and does not say what sort of music might have proved most resistant to this discontinuance.--&gt; An example is [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s Concerto in D minor for flute, strings and basso continuo. Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Figured bass notation==
A part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.

The phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B–D–G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).

Composers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.

Contemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.

The numbers indicate the number of [[Scale (music)|scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/MU182A/upload/Figured-Bass-Notation.pdf|title=Figured Bass Notation|last=Vigil|first=R|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 } \figures { &lt; 6 4 &gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Here, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A. In other words, the second inversion of an F major chord can be realized as:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a f c&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

In cases where the numbers 3 or 5 would normally be understood, these are usually left out. For example:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; _ &gt;1 &lt; 6 &gt; &lt; 7 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

has the same meaning as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass &lt;&lt; { \cadenzaOn c1 b, g, } \figures { &lt; 5 3 &gt;1 &lt; 6 3 &gt; &lt; 7 5 3 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

and can be realized as

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \clef bass \cadenzaOn &lt;c e g&gt;1 &lt;b, d g&gt; &lt;g, b, d f&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

although the performer may choose which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way, such as by playing them as [[Arpeggio|arpeggios]] rather than as [[Block chord|block chords]], or by adding improvised [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]], depending on the [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture of the music]].

Sometimes, other numbers are omitted: a 2 on its own or {{su|b=2|p=4}} indicates {{overset|6|{{SubSup||2|4}}}}, for example. From the figured bass-writer's perspective, this bass note is obviously a [[third inversion]] [[seventh chord]], so the [[sixth interval]] is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the [[chord progression|progression]] or the melody.

Sometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held. In these cases the figures for the new chord are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur.

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass { c1 } } \figures { &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 5 &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 &lt;&lt; { a'2 g' } \new Staff { \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;a e&gt;2 &lt;g e&gt; } \\ { c1 } &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When the bass note changes but the notes in the chord above it are to be held, a line is drawn next to the figure or figures, for as long as the chord is to be held, to indicate this:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c2 b, } \figures { \bassFigureExtendersOn &lt; 6 &gt;2 &lt; 6&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as  &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 6/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;e a&gt;1 } \\ { c2 b, }  &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Note that when the bass moves the chord intervals have effectively changed, in this case from {{su|b=3|p=6}} to {{su|b=4|p=7}}, but no additional numbers are written.

===Accidentals===

When an [[accidental (music)|accidental]] is shown on its own without a number, it applies to the note a third above the lowest note; most commonly, this is the third of the chord.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harmony, Fifth Edition|last=Piston|first=Walter|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=1987|isbn=978-0-393-95480-7|location=New York|pages=84-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, if a number is shown, the accidental affects the said interval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, this, showing the widespread default meaning of an accidental without number as applying to the third above the bass:

:&lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;&lt; { e1 c } \figures { &lt; _+ &gt;1 &lt; 6- _- &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can be realized as &lt;score&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \clef bass &lt;e gis b&gt;1 &lt;c ees aes&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

Sometimes the accidental is placed after the number rather than before it.

Alternatively, a cross placed next to a number indicates that the pitch of that note should be raised ([[augmented interval|augmented]]) by a [[semitone]] (so that if it is normally a [[flat (music)|flat]] it becomes a natural, and if it is normally a natural it becomes a [[sharp (music)|sharp]]). A different way to indicate this is to draw a [[backslash]] through the number itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following three notations, therefore, all indicate the same thing:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c c } \figures { &lt; 6! &gt;1 &lt; 6\+ &gt; &lt;6\\&gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can all be realized as &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees a&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

More rarely, a ''forward'' slash through a number indicates that a pitch is to be lowered ([[diminished interval|diminished]]) by a semitone:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { c1 c } \figures { &lt; 5- &gt;1 &lt; 5/ &gt; } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt; can both be realized as  &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;{ \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \time 4/4 \key c \minor \clef bass &lt;&lt; { &lt;c ees ges&gt;1 } &gt;&gt; }&lt;/score&gt;

When sharps or flats are used with [[key signature]]s, they may have a slightly different meaning, especially in 17th-century music. A sharp might be used to cancel a flat in the key signature, or vice versa, instead of a [[natural sign]].

== History ==

Improvised organ accompaniments for choral works were common by the late 16th century, and separate organ parts showing only a bass line date back to at least 1587.  In the mid-16th century, some Italian church composers began to write [[polychoral]] works. These pieces, for two or more [[choir]]s, were created in recognition of particularly festive occasions, or else to take advantage of certain architectural properties of the buildings in which they were performed which created natural [[reverberation]]. With eight or more [[polyphony|polyphonic]] voice parts to keep track of in performance, works in polychoral style required some sort of instrumental [[accompaniment]]. They were also known as ''cori spezzati'', since the choirs were structured in musically independent or interlocking parts, and may sometimes also have been placed in physically different locations.

The concept of allowing two or more concurrently performing choirs to be independent structurally would probably not have arisen had there not been an already existing practice of choral accompaniment in church.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Financial and administrative records indicate the presence of organs in churches dates back to the 15th century, although their precise use is not known. Many first-person accounts of church services from the 15th and 16th centuries imply organ accompaniment in some portions of the liturgy, as well as indicating that the [[a cappella|unaccompanied]] practice of the ''[[Sistine Chapel Choir|Cappella Sistina]]'' was somewhat unusual. By early in the 16th century, it seems that accompaniment by organ at least in smaller churches was commonplace, and commentators of the time lamented on occasion the declining quality of church choirs. Even more tellingly, many manuscripts, especially from the middle of the century and later, feature written-out organ accompaniments. It is this last observation which leads directly to the foundations of continuo practice, in a somewhat similar one called ''basso seguente'' or "following bass".

Written-out accompaniments are found most often in early polychoral works (those composed, obviously, before the onset of [[concertato|concerted]] style and its explicit instrumental lines), and generally consist of a complete reduction (to what would later be called the "grand staff") of one choir’s parts.  In addition to this, however, for those parts of the music during which that choir rested was presented a single line consisting of the lowest note being sung at any given time, which could be in any vocal part.  Even in early concerted works by the Gabrielis ([[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli|Giovanni]]), [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and others, the lowest part, that which modern performers colloquially call "continuo", is actually a "basso seguente", though slightly different, since with separate instrumental parts, the lowest note of the moment in the instrumental parts is often lower than any being sung.

The first known published instance of a basso seguente was a book of [[Introit]]s and [[Alleluia]]s by the Venetian [[Placido Falconio]] from 1575. What is known as "figured" continuo, which also features a bass line that because of its structural nature may differ from the lowest note in the upper parts, developed over the next quarter-century. The composer [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana|Lodovico Viadana]] is often credited with the first publication of such a continuo, in a 1602 collection of motets that according to his own account had been originally written in 1594. Viadana’s continuo, however, did not include figures. The earliest extant part with sharp and flat signs above the staff is a [[motet]] by [[Giovanni Croce]], also from 1594.

Following and figured basses developed concurrently in secular music; such [[madrigal]] (a song style) composers as [[Emilio de' Cavalieri]] and [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] began in the late 16th century to write works explicitly for a soloist with accompaniment, following an already standing practice of performing multi-voice madrigals this way, and also responding to the rising influence at certain aristocratic courts of featuring popular individual singers.  This tendency toward solo-with-accompaniment texture in [[secular vocal music]] (non-religious music) culminated in the genre of [[monody]], just as in sacred vocal music it resulted in the [[sacred concerto]] for various forces including few voices and even solo voices. The use of numerals to indicate accompanying sonorities in accompaniment parts began with the earliest [[opera]]s, composed by Cavalieri and [[Giulio Caccini]].

These new genres, just as the polychoral one probably was, were indeed made possible by the existence of a semi- or fully independent bass line.  In turn, the separate bass line, with figures added above to indicate other chordal notes, shortly became "[[Functional harmony|functional]]," as the sonorities became "harmonies," (see [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]), and music came to be seen in terms of a melody supported by [[chord progression]]s ([[homophony]]), rather than interlocking, equally important lines that are used in [[polyphony]].  The figured bass, therefore, was integral to the development of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], by extension the [[Classical music era|”classical”]] style, which built on the innovations of the Baroque era, and by further extension most subsequent musical styles.

As part of the new [[Classical period (music)#The Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730–1760|galant]] style in the mid-18th century, with its emphasis on lighter and more varied textures, and singable melodies, orchestral music gradually phased out the basso continuo, and solo-with-accompaniment textures increasingly featured fully written-out accompaniments. By the second half of the 18th century, figured bass was almost entirely eliminated, except in sacred choral music, where it lingered until well after 1800: Beethoven's [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), for example, has a figured bass part.

Many composers and theorists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries wrote "how-to guides" for chord-playing musicians, to aid them in realizing figured bass notation, including [[Gregor Aichinger]], [[Filippo Bonaffino]], [[Friedrich Erhard Niedt]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]], and [[Michael Praetorius]].

==Contemporary uses==
In the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by [[classical music]]ians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a [[composer]] is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is [[Harmonic analysis|analyzing the harmony]] of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces.  A form of figured bass is used in notation of [[accordion]] music; another simplified form is used to notate [[guitar chord]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the 2000s, outside of professional [[Baroque ensemble]]s that specialize in the [[performance practice]] of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the [[inversion (music)|inversion]] in a harmonic analysis or composer's sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure. For instance, if a piano piece had a C major triad in the right hand (C–E–G), with the bass note a G with the left hand, this would be a [[second inversion]] C major chord, which would be written C{{su|b=4|p=6}}. If this same C major triad had an E in the bass, it would be a [[first inversion]] chord, which would be written C{{su|b=3|p=6}} or C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (this is different from the [[jazz]] notation, where a C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; means the [[major sixth]] chord C–E–G–A, i.e., a C major with an added 6th degree). The symbols can also be used with Roman numerals in analyzing [[diatonic functionality|functional harmony]], a usage called ''figured Roman''; see [[chord symbol]].

'''Gloria Daisy Wekker''' (born June 13, 1950) is an [[Afro-Surinamese]] Dutch educator and writer who has focused on gender studies and sexuality in the Afro-Caribbean region and diaspora. She was the winner of the Ruth Benedict Prize from the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 2007.

==Biography==
Gloria Wekker was born in 1950 in [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria Wekker|url=http://www.surinamstars.com/Gloria%20Wekker.html|publisher=Surinam Stars|accessdate=10 February 2016|location=Paramaribo, Suriname|language=Dutch|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Amsterdam]] in the 1970s and became active in the Afro-European Women’s Movement.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pesole|first1=Betta|title=Gloria Wekker|url=http://www.encyclopediaofafroeuropeanstudies.eu/encyclopedia/gloria-wekker/|work=Encyclopedia of Afro-European Studies|accessdate=10 February 2016|location=Universidad de León, León, Spain|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wekker earned a master's degree in [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars" /&gt; from the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1981 and began her career working in various governmental agencies in Amsterdam, such as the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Culture on Ethnic Minorities' Affairs and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. In 1984, she became a founding member of "Sister Outsider", an Amsterdam-based, literary circle for lesbian black women named after the work by [[Audre Lorde]]. In 1987, she served as a Policy Associate in the Office for the Coordination of Ethnic Minorities' Affairs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;

In 1992, Wekker earned her doctorate at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with a thesis on the sexuality and subjectivity of Afro-Surinamese women. In 2001, she was appointed to the Aletta-chair of the Department of Women's Studies at the [[Utrecht University]].&lt;ref name="Surinam Stars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dialogo Global"&gt;{{cite web|title=9th Annual Summer School on Black Europe|url=http://www.dialogoglobal.com/amsterdam/people.php|publisher=Dialogo Global|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloria Wekker|url=https://sta.uwi.edu/crgs/november2009/gloriawekker.asp|publisher=The University of the West Indies|accessdate=11 February 2016|location=St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work focuses on the intersections of [[colonialism]], racism, [[white privilege]], feminist theory, lesbian theory and women in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Duke Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/white-innocence|publisher=Duke University Press|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Batra|2011|p=155}} Her work has earned her the title of "Holland’s [[Angela Davis]]"&lt;ref name="Neilson, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neilson|first1=Zoe|title=For Pete's sake|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/pete%E2%80%99s-sake|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]|date=7 December 2014|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; as she has forced the Dutch to examine their alleged ingrained stereotypes and attitudes towards racism and patriarchy.&lt;ref name="De Wereld Morgen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wekker|first1=Gloria|title=Acht wetenschappelijk onderbouwde argumenten tegen Zwarte Piet|work=De Wereld Morgen |date=23 October 2014|location=Antwerp, Belgium|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led debate which questioned the racist nature of such iconic images in Dutch tradition as [[Santa|Sinterklaas]] (Santa Clause)'s helpers as [[blackface]] [[golliwogs]] known as ''Zwarte Piet'' (Black Pete),&lt;ref name="Neilson, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten Broeke, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=ten Broeke|first1=Asha|title=Zwarte Piet|url=http://www.utnieuws.nl/opinie/60711/Zwarte_Piet|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=UT Nieuws |date=11 November 2014|location=University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the imagery of what constitutes beauty.&lt;ref name="Julen, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Julen|first1=Jeannine|title='Kroes gaan' is een hele stap|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4328/Opinie/article/detail/3546096/2013/11/17/Kroes-gaan-is-een-hele-stap.dhtml|accessdate=11 February 2016|publisher=de Verdieping Trouw|date=17 November 2013|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helioseismology''', a term coined by [[Douglas Gough]], is the study of the structure and dynamics of the [[Sun]] through its oscillations.  These are principally caused by sound waves that are continuously driven and damped by convection near the Sun's surface.  It is similar to [[seismology|geoseismology]], or [[asteroseismology]] (also coined by Gough), which are respectively the studies of the [[Earth]] or [[star]]s through their oscillations. While the Sun's oscillations were first detected in the early 1960s, it was only in the mid-1970s that it was realised that the oscillations propagated throughout the Sun and could allow scientists to study the Sun's deep interior.  The modern field is separated into '''global helioseismology''', which studies the Sun's resonant modes, and '''local helioseismology''', which studies all the waves propagating at the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name="gb2005"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gizon | first1 = L. | last2 = Birch | first2 = A.

Helioseismology has contributed to a number of scientific breakthroughs.  The most notable was to show the predicted neutrino flux from the Sun could not be caused by flaws in stellar models and must instead be a problem of [[particle physics]].  The so-called [[solar neutrino problem]] was ultimately resolved by [[neutrino oscillations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bahcall | first1 = J.

Helioseismology also allowed accurate measurements of the quadrupole (and higher-order) moments of the Sun's gravitational potential, which are consistent with [[general relativity]].  The first helioseismic calculations of the Sun's internal rotation profile showed a rough separation into a rigidly-rotating core and differentially-rotating envelope.  The boundary layer is now known as the [[tachocline]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Spiegel | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Zahn | first2 = J.-P. | title = The solar tachocline | year = 1992 | journal =  	Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 265 | pages = 106| bibcode = 1992A&amp;A...265..106S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to be a key component for the [[solar dynamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Fan | first1 = Y. | title = Magnetic Fields in the Solar Convection Zone | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 4| bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....4F| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it roughly coincides with the base of the solar convection zone—also inferred through helioseismology—it is conceptually a distinct entity.

Helioseismology benefits most from continuous monitoring of the Sun, which began first with uninterrupted observations from near the [[South Pole]] over the southern summer.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Duvall | first1 = Jr. T.

These studies are made possible by global telescope networks like the [[Global Oscillations Network Group]] (GONG) and the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]] (BiSON), which have been operating for over 20 years.

The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]
Solar oscillation modes are interpreted (to first order) as vibrations of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluid in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].  Each mode is then characterised by three numbers:

* the number of nodal shells in radius, known as the ''radial order'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;;
* the total number of nodal circles on each spherical shell, known as the ''angular degree'' &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the number of those nodal circles that are longitudinal, known as the ''azimuthal order'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter two correspond to the quantum numbers of the [[spherical harmonic]]s.  Under these assumptions, it can be shown that
the oscillations are separated into two categories of interior oscillations and a third special category of surface modes.

=== Pressure modes (p-modes) ===

Pressure modes are in essence standing sound waves.  The dominant restoring force is the pressure (rather than buoyancy), hence the name.  All the solar oscillations that are used for inferences about the interior are p-modes, with frequencies between about 1 and 5 millihertz. They span angular degrees from zero (purely radial motion) to several hundred.

=== Gravity modes (g-modes) ===

Gravity modes are lower-frequency modes that are confined to the convectively-stable interior.  The restoring force is buoyancy and thus indirectly gravity, from which they take their name.  They are [[evanescent wave|evanescent]] in the convection zone and therefore have tiny amplitudes at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Appourchaux | first1 = T. | last2 = Belkacem | first2 = K. | last3 = Broomhall | first3 = A.-M. | last4 = Chaplin | first4 = W.

=== Surface gravity modes (f-modes) ===

Surface gravity waves are analogous to waves on deep water.  To good approximation, they follow the same dispersion law: &lt;math&gt;\omega^2=gk_h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the surface gravity and &lt;math&gt;k_h&lt;/math&gt; is the horizontal wavenumber.  Surface gravity modes observed on the Sun are all of very high degree (&lt;math&gt;\ell\gtrsim80&lt;/math&gt;).

The three passbands of the VIRGO/SPM instrument show nearly the same power spectrum.

The low-frequency region is dominated by the signal of granulation. As the angular degree increases, the individual mode frequencies converge onto clear ridges, each corresponding to a sequence of low-order modes.]]

The chief tool for analysing data in global helioseismology is the [[Fourier transform]].  To good approximation, each mode is a damped harmonic oscillator, for which the power as a function of frequency is a [[Lorentz function]].  Resolved data is usually integrated over the desired spherical harmonic to obtain a single timeseries that can be Fourier transformed.  In this way, helioseismologists combine a power spectrum for each spherical harmonic into a two-dimensional power spectrum.

The lower frequency range of the oscillations is dominated by the variations caused by [[granulation (solar physics)|granulation]]. This must first be filtered out before (or at the same time that) the modes are analysed.  Granular flows at the solar surface are mostly horizontal, from the centres of the rising granules to the narrow downdrafts between them.  Relative to the oscillations, granulation produces a stronger signal in intensity than line-of-sight velocity, so the latter is preferred for helioseismic observatories.

=== Local helioseismology ===

Local helioseismology—a term coined by Charles Lindsey, Doug Braun and Stuart Jefferies in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Lindsey, C. | author2=Braun, D.C. | author3=Jefferies, S.M. | title= "Local Helioseismology of Subsurface Structure" in "GONG 1992.

Thus, ring-diagram analysis is a generalization of global helioseismology applied to local areas on the Sun (as opposed to half of the Sun). For example, the sound speed and [[adiabatic index]] can be compared within magnetically active and inactive (quiet Sun) regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Basu, S. |author2=Antia, H.M. |author3=Bogart, R.S. |title= Ring-Diagram Analysis of the Structure of Solar Active Regions |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= August 2004 |volume= 610 |issue= 2 |pages= 1157–1168 |doi= 10.1086/421843 |bibcode= 2004ApJ...610.1157B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions on the far side of the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like [[seismic migration]], a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Donea, A.-C. |author2=Braun, D.C. |author3=Lindsey, C. |title= Seismic Images of a Solar Flare |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |date= March 1999 |volume= 513 |issue= 2 |pages= L143–L146 |doi= 10.1086/311915 |bibcode= 1999ApJ...513L.143D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inversion ==

=== Introduction ===

The Sun's oscillation modes represent a discrete set of observations that are sensitive to its continuous structure.  This allows scientists to formulate [[inverse problem]]s for the Sun's interior structure and dynamics.  Given a reference model of the Sun, the differences in the mode frequencies are weighted averages of the differences between the structure of the reference model and the real Sun.  The difference in the mode frequencies can then be used to infer the differences in the structures.  The weighting functions of these averages are known as ''kernels''.

=== Structure ===

The first inversions of the Sun's structure were made using Duvall's law&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Duvall | first2 = Jr. T.

=== Rotation ===
[[File:HMI 2D solar rotation profile.png|thumb|The internal rotation profile of the Sun inferred using data from the [[Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager]] aboard the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]]. The inner radius has been truncated where the measurements are less certain than 1%, which happens around 3/4 of the way to the core. The dashed line indicates the base of the solar convection zone, which happens to coincide with the boundary at which the rotation profile changes, known as the tachocline.]]

If the Sun were perfectly spherical, the modes with different azimuthal orders ''m'' would have the same frequencies.  Rotation, however, breaks this degeneracy, and the modes frequencies differ by ''rotational splittings'' that are weighted-averages of the rotation rate throughout the Sun.  
Different modes are sensitive to different parts of the Sun and, given enough data, these differences can be used to infer the rotation rate throughout the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M.

In reality, different layers of the Sun rotate at different speeds, as can be seen at the surface, where the equator rotates faster than the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Beck | first1 = J.

The Sun rotates slowly enough that a spherical, non-rotating model serves as close enough to reality to derive the rotational kernels.

Helioseismology has shown that the Sun has a rotation profile with several features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Howe | first1 = R. | title = Solar Interior Rotation and its Variation | year = 2009 | journal = Living Reviews in Solar Physics | volume = 6 | pages = 1| arxiv = 0902.2406 | bibcode = 2009LRSP....6....1H| doi = 10.12942/lrsp-2009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a rigidly-rotating radiative (i.e. non-convective) zone, though the rotation rate of the inner core is not well known;
* a thin shear layer, known as the ''tachocline'', which separates the rigidly-rotating interior and the differentially-rotating convective envelope;
* a convective envelope in which the rotation rate varies both with depth and latitude; and
* a final shear layer just beneath the surface, in which the rotation rate slows down towards the surface.

== Relationship to other fields ==

=== Geoseismology ===

{{Main|Seismology}}

Helioseismology was born from analogy with [[seismology|geoseismology]] but several important differences remain.  First, the Sun lacks a solid surface and therefore cannot support [[shear wave]]s.  From the data analysis perspective, global helioseismology differs from geoseismology by studying only normal modes.  Local helioseismology is thus somewhat closer in spirit to geoseismology in the sense that it studies the complete wavefield.

=== Asteroseismology ===

{{Main|Asteroseismology}}

Because the Sun is a star, helioseismology is closely related to the study of oscillations in other stars, known as [[asteroseismology]]. Helioseismology is most closely related to the study of stars whose oscillations are also driven and damped by their outer convection zones, known as [[solar-like oscillations|solar-like oscillators]], but the underlying theory is broadly the same for other classes of variable star.

The principal difference is that oscillations in distant stars cannot be resolved.  Because the brighter and darker sectors of the spherical harmonic cancel out, this restricts asteroseismology almost entirely to the study of low degree modes (angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell\leq3&lt;/math&gt;).  This makes inversion much more difficult but upper limits can still be achieved by making more restrictive assumptions.

At a similar time,  [[Jørgen Christensen-Dalsgaard]] and [[Douglas Gough]] suggested the potential of using individual mode frequencies to infer the interior structure of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Gough | first2 = D.

Helioseismology developed rapidly in the 1980s. A major breakthrough was made when observations from [[Antarctica]] linked the frequencies for modes of low and intermediate angular degree, from which the radial orders of the modes could be identified.&lt;ref name="duvall_southpole1983" /&gt;  In addition, new methods of inversion developed, allowing researchers to infer the sound speed profile of the Sun.  Towards the end of the decade, observations also began to show that the oscillation mode frequencies vary with the [[solar cycle|Sun's magnetic activity cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Libbrecht | first1 = K.

To overcome the problem of not being able to observe the Sun at night, several groups had begun to assemble networks of telescopes (e.g. the [[Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network]], or BiSON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Aindow | first1 = A. | last2 = Elsworth | first2 = Y.

Long, uninterrupted observations brought the field to maturity, and the state of the field was summarized in a 1996 special issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Science | title = Special Issue: GONG Helioseismology | volume = 272 | issue = 5266 | year = 1996 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/272/5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This coincided with the start of normal operations of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SoHO), which began producing high-quality data for helioseismology.

The subsequent years saw the resolution of the solar neutrino problem and the long observations began to allow analysis of multiple solar activity cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = W.

Space-based observations by SoHO have continued and SoHO was joined in 2010 by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), which has also been monitoring the Sun continuously since its operations began.  In addition, ground-based networks (notably BiSON and GONG) continue to operate, providing nearly continuous data from the ground too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15735">The '''history of [[evolutionary psychology]]''' began with [[Charles Darwin]], who said that humans have social instincts that evolved by natural selection. Darwin's work inspired later psychologists such as [[William James]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] but for most of the 20th century psychologists focused more on behaviorism and proximate explanations for human behavior. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s landmark 1975 book, ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis|Sociobiology]]'', synthesized recent theoretical advances in evolutionary theory to explain social behavior in animals, including humans. [[Jerome H. Barkow|Jerome Barkow]], [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] popularized the term "evolutionary psychology" in their 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind|The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture]]''.&lt;ref name="Tooby, John; Barkow, Jerome H.; Cosmides, Leda 1995"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tooby, John |author2=Barkow, Jerome H. |author3=Cosmides, Leda |title=The Adapted mind: evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-510107-3 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like sociobiology before it, evolutionary psychology has been embroiled in controversy, but evolutionary psychologists see their field as gaining increased acceptance overall.

==19th century==
After his seminal work in developing theories of natural selection, Charles Darwin devoted much of his final years to the study of animal emotions and psychology. He wrote two books;''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' in 1871 and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' in 1872 that dealt with topics related to evolutionary psychology. He introduced the concepts of [[sexual selection]] to explain the presence of animal structures that seemed unrelated to survival, such as the peacock's tail. He also introduced theories concerning [[group selection]] and [[kin selection]] to explain [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="moralanimal"&gt;Wright, Robert. The Moral Animal: Why We Are, the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology. Vintage. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin pondered why humans and animals were often generous to their group members. Darwin felt that acts of generosity decreased the fitness of generous individuals. This fact contradicted natural selection which favored the fittest individual. Darwin concluded that while generosity decreased the fitness of individuals, generosity would increase the fitness of a group. In this case, altruism arose due to competition between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Good and Evil|last=Shermer|
authorlink=Michael Shermer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igN6Q9weoYQC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22from+competition+between+groups%22 |isbn=978-0-8050-7769-8 |year=2004 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following quote, from Darwin's ''Origin of Species'', is often interpreted by evolutionary psychologists as indication of his foreshadowing the emergence of the field:
{{quote|In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.|{{cite wikisource |first=Charles |last=Darwin |title=The Origin of Species |year=1859 |page=488 |wslink=Page%3AOrigin_of_Species_1859_facsimile.djvu/500}}}}

==20th century==
Darwin's theory inspired [[William James]]'s [[Functional psychology|functionalist]] approach to psychology.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. Psychology. Worth Publishers. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of his theory was a system of "instincts."&lt;ref name="Buss 1"/&gt; James wrote that humans had many instincts, even more than other animals.&lt;ref name="Buss 1"/&gt; These instincts, he said, could be overridden by experience and by each other, as many of the instincts were actually in conflict with each other.&lt;ref name="Buss 1"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary psychology: the new science of the mind. Pearson. 2008. Chapter 1, p. 2-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/EP-primer.html Evolutionary Psychology Primer] Tooby and Cosmides make note of James' perspective, and also quote him:

:"We do not realize that 'normal' behavior needs to be explained at all. This "instinct blindness" makes the study of psychology difficult. To get past this problem, James suggested that we try to make the "natural seem strange":

::''It takes...a mind debauched by learning to carry the process of making the natural seem strange, so far as to ask for the why of any instinctive human act. To the metaphysician alone can such questions occur as: Why do we smile, when pleased, and not scowl? Why are we unable to talk to a crowd as we talk to a single friend? Why does a particular maiden turn our wits so upside-down? The common man can only say, Of course we smile, of course our heart palpitates at the sight of the crowd, of course we love the maiden, that beautiful soul clad in that perfect form, so palpably and flagrantly made for all eternity to be loved!''

::''And so, probably, does each animal feel about the particular things it tends to do in the presence of particular objects. ... To the lion it is the lioness which is made to be loved; to the bear, the she-bear. To the broody hen the notion would probably seem monstrous that there should be a creature in the world to whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and precious and never-to-be-too-much-sat-upon object which it is to her.''

::''Thus we may be sure that, however mysterious some animals' instincts may appear to us, our instincts will appear no less mysterious to them.'' (William James, 1890)

:In our view, William James was right about evolutionary psychology. Making the natural seem strange is unnatural -- it requires the twisted outlook seen, for example, in Gary Larson cartoons. Yet it is a pivotal part of the enterprise. Many psychologists avoid the study of natural competences, thinking that there is nothing there to be explained."

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], perhaps Anarchist thinker [[Peter Kropotkin]] could be credited as having founded evolutionary psychology, when in his 1902 book [[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]] he argued that the human instinct for cooperation and mutual aid could be seen as stemming from evolutionary adaption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/200401--.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] made a reference to "evolutionary psychology" in his 1919 book ''An Introduction to Social Psychology'': "It is only a comparative and evolutionary psychology that can provide the needed basis (for psychology); and this could not be created before the work of Darwin had convinced men of the continuity of human with animal evolution as regards all bodily characters, and had prepared the way for the quickly following recognition of the similar continuity of man’s mental evolution with that of the animal world." (p.&amp;nbsp;16)

==Post world war II==
While Darwin's theories on natural selection gained acceptance in the early part of the 20th century, his theories on evolutionary psychology were largely ignored. Only after the second world war, in the 1950s, did interest increase in the systematic study of animal behavior. It was during this period that the modern field of [[ethology]] emerged. [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] were pioneers in developing the theoretical framework for ethology for which they would receive a Nobel prize in 1973.

[[Desmond Morris]]'s book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' attempted to frame human behavior in the context of evolution, but his explanations failed to convince academics because they were based on a teleological (goal-oriented) understanding of evolution. For example, he said that the pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other males.&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

==Sociobiology==
In 1975, [[E. O. Wilson]] built upon the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen by combining studies of animal behavior, social behavior and evolutionary theory in his book ''[[Sociobiology:The New Synthesis]].'' Wilson included a chapter on human behavior. Wilson's application of evolutionary analysis to human behavior caused bitter debate.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thirdchimpanzee"&gt;Diamond, Jared. The Third Chimpanzee.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of ''Sociobiology'', evolutionary thinking for the first time had an identifiable presence in the field of psychology.&lt;ref name="Psychology"/&gt; E. O. Wilson argues that the field of evolutionary psychology is essentially the same as "human [[sociobiology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociobiology |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |last=Wilson |first=E. O. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7lV9tz8fXAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=Human+sociobiology+...now+called+evolutionary+psychology+...+emerged+as+its+own+field+of+study+...+from+biology+and+social+science |quote=Human sociobiology, now often called evolutionary psychology, has in the last quarter of a century emerged as its own field of study, drawing on theory and data from both biology and the social sciences. |isbn=978-0-674-00235-7 |year=2000 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and appears continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly used as substitute for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use of the term "evolutionary psychology"==
The term ''evolutionary psychology'' was used by American biologist [[Michael Ghiselin]] in a 1973 article published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ghiselin MT |title=Darwin and Evolutionary Psychology: Darwin initiated a radically new way of studying behavior |journal=Science |volume=179 |issue=4077 |pages=964–968 |year=1973 |pmid=17842154 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4077.964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Barkow, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby popularized the term "evolutionary psychology" in their 1992 book ''The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tooby, John; Barkow, Jerome H.; Cosmides, Leda 1995"/&gt;

In contrast to sociobiology and behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology emphasizes that organisms are "adaptation executors" rather than "fitness maximizers."&lt;ref name="Buss, D. M. 1995"&gt;Buss, D. M. (1995). Evolutionary psychology: A new paradigm for psychological science. Psychological Inquiry, 6, 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, organisms have emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations that generally increased inclusive fitness in the past but may not do so in the present. This distinction may explain some maladaptive behaviors that are the result of "fitness lags" between ancestral and modern environments.&lt;ref name="Buss, D. M. 1995"/&gt; For example, our ancestrally developed desires for fat, sugar and salt often lead to health problems in modern environment where these are readily available in large quantities.

Also, in contrast to sociobiology and behavioral ecology (which mostly study non-human animal behavior), rather than focus primarily on overt behavior, EP attempts to identify underlying psychological adaptations (including emotional, motivational and cognitive mechanisms), and how these mechanisms interact with the developmental and current environmental influences to produce behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ni9ggiew1UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=sociobiology+evolutionary+psychology+controversy Evolutionary Psychology By Lance Workman, Will Reader]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1990, introductory psychology textbooks scarcely mentioned Darwin.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 1-24"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 1, p 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, evolutionary psychology was treated as a fringe theory,&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"&gt;[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Group/BussLAB/pdffiles/evolutionary_psychology_AP_2010.pdf Confer, et al., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary psychologists depicted themselves as an embattled minority.&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt; Coverage in psychology textbooks was largely hostile.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt; According to evolutionary psychologists, current coverage in psychology textbooks is usually neutral or balanced.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt;

The presence that evolutionary theory holds in psychology has been steadily increasing.&lt;ref name="Psychology"/&gt; According to its proponents, evolutionary psychology now occupies a central place in psychological science.&lt;ref name="Confer 2010"/&gt;

The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

The '''Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities''' ('''IATH''')  is a research unit of the [[University of Virginia]], USA. Its goal is to explore and develop [[information technology]] as a tool for scholarly [[humanities]] research. To that end, IATH provide Fellows with consulting, technical support, applications development, and networked publishing facilities. It cultivates partnerships and participate in humanities computing initiatives with libraries, publishers, information technology companies, scholarly organizations, and other groups residing at the intersection of computers and cultural heritage.

The research projects, essays, and documentation are the products of a collaboration between humanities and computer science research faculty, computer professionals, student assistants and project managers, and library faculty and staff. In many cases, this work is supported by private or federal funding agencies. In all cases, it is supported by the Fellows’ home departments; the College or School to which those departments belong; the University of Virginia Library; the Vice President for Research and Public Service; the Vice President and Chief Information Officer; the Provost; and the President of the University of Virginia.

==History==
The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities was established at the University of Virginia in 1992, with a major grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University.

IATH’s founders are in humanities computing, digital scholarship, and academic administration. Beginning in 1992 a steering committee of scholars, including [[Edward Ayers]], [[Alan Batson]], [[Jerome McGann]], [[Kendon Stubbs]] and [[William Wulf]] managed IATH. A search committee commissioned by the steering committee carried out the search for a director of the institute. [[John Unsworth]] was selected, and his term began September 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/new-leader-ever-expanding-university-library-looks-future |title=With New Leader, Ever-Expanding University Library Looks to the Future |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |first=Katie |last=McNally |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATH has generated over $10.7 million in grant funding and gifts in kind since it began operations.  Much of this funding has come from Federal agencies and private foundations, and has gone to support faculty research and teaching across the University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Lavizan-Shian''' was an alleged undeclared nuclear site north-eastern [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. The site was under investigation by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] as a potential undeclared nuclear site. According to Reuters, claims by the US that topsoil has been removed and the site had been sanitized could not be verified by IAEA investigators who visited Lavizan. In Paragraph 39 of the IAEA's November 2005 report on Iran, the IAEA stated "The information provided by Iran appeared to be coherent and consistent with its explanation of the razing of the Lavisan-Shian area."

'''Leiden Observatory''' ('''Sterrewacht Leiden''' in Dutch) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] in the city of [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]]. It was established by [[Leiden University]] in 1633, to house the quadrant of [[Rudolph Snellius]], making it the oldest operating university observatory in the world, with the only older still existing observatory being the [[Vatican Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deborah Todd, Joseph A. Angelo|title=A to Z of Scientists in Space and Astronomy|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=1438109237|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3l4Rngj4B0C&amp;pg=PA262 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

The observatory was initially located on the university building in the centre of Leiden before a new observatory building and dome were constructed in the university's botanical garden in 1860. It remained there until 1974 when the department moved to the science campus north-west of the city.

Some notable astronomers have worked or directed the observatory including [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]], and [[Jan Oort]].

==History==

===1633–1860===
[[File:Leiden Observatory in 1670.png|thumb|left|Drawing of Leiden Observatory in 1670, seen on top of the university building.]]

[[Leiden University]] established the observatory in 1633; astronomy had been on the curriculum for a long time, and due to possession of a large [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] built by [[Rudolph Snellius]], [[Jacobus Golius]] requested an observatory in which to use it. The observatory was one of the first purpose-built observatories in [[Europe]]. Though Golius used the observatory regularly, no publications came from its use by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prögler|first1=Daniela|title=English Students at Leiden University, 1575-1650|date=2014|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=1409484041|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPmAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT168 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Golius had any instrumentation other than Snellius' quadrant at the observatory.&lt;ref name=deSitter&gt;{{cite book |title= Short History of the Observatory of the University at Leiden 1633-1933 |author= W. de Sitter |date= 1933 |publisher= Joh. Enschede en Zonen, Haarlem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682 [[Burchardus de Volder]] became professor of mathematics at the university and thus took over responsibility for the observatory. During his tenure, the observatory was enlarged, including a second turret to house a brass [[sextant]] which he purchased, and the rebuilding of the old turret. Both turrets had rotating roofs. Upon retiring in 1705, de Volder handed over a catalogue of instruments which showed that the observatory owned two other quadrants, a 12-inch telescope, two [[Objective (optics)|objectives]], and several smaller telescopes. For the next two years, Lotharius Zumbach de Coesfeld ran the observatory until his appointment as professor of mathematics in [[Kassel]] in 1708. Between then and 1717 the observatory went without a director until [[Willem 's Gravesande]] was appointed director. During his time at the observatory, 's Gravesande purchase a number of new instruments including new telescopes and tools, before his death in 1742.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

's Gravesande's successor was Johan Lulofs who used the observatory to observe [[Halley's comet]] in 1759 and [[solar transit]]s of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1743 and 1753 and [[Venus]] in 1761. In November 1768 when Lulofs died, Dionysius van de Wijnpersse took over responsibility for the observatory until [[Pieter Nieuwland]] became its director in 1793 for a year until he died in 1794. For a number of years the curators attempted to find a suitable astronomer to look after the observatory, eventually employing [[Jan Frederik van Beeck Calkoen]] in 1799, who left in 1805.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

In 1817 the observatory towers were pulled down and rebuilt. [[Frederik Kaiser]] was appointed lecturer of astronomy and director of the observatory in 1837, and again renovated the observatory, providing the towers with rotatable roofs with full shutters, and reinforcing the north-western tower. Kaiser also acquired a number of new instruments and telescopes with which he made observations including that of comets, planets, and [[binary star]]s.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

As a result of the increased interest in astronomy brought about due to Kaiser's popular writings and teachings, a commission was founded in 1853 to fund a new observatory.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt; From 1859 to 1909 the [[Netherlands]] [[civil time]] was set according to the local civil time at the observatory; communicated using the [[telegraphic]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.rug.nl/~vdkruit/JCKapteyn/HHKbiog.pdf |title= J.C.

===1860–present===
[[Image:Leiden old observatory2.jpg|thumb|left|The second building to house the Leiden Observatory (built in 1860). This building now houses part of the law faculty. Two of the optical [[telescope]] domes can be seen on the roof.]]

By 1860 the new observatory building was completed. The new building was constructed in a quiet side of the city inside the university’s botanical gardens. It consisted of a number of offices, living quarters for astronomers, and a number of observing domes containing telescopes. In 1873 two new rooms were added to the building in order to house the tools required to verify nautical instruments; tools used to test compasses, sextants and other instruments. Two of the domes were rebuilt, one in 1875 and the other in 1889.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

More new buildings were constructed before the end of the 19th century including the Western tower in 1878, one to the East in 1898, and another small building to house a gas engine in the same year (used for electricity until the observatory was connected to the city grid). In 1896 the observatory purchased their first photographic telescope, with a dome being built to house it between then and 1898.&lt;ref name=deSitter/&gt;

In 1923 the observatory formed a research agreement with [[Union Observatory]] to allow researchers use of both facilities. The first visitor from Leiden was [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]]. In 1954 the telescopes were moved to [[Hartbeespoort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assa.saao.ac.za/sections/history/observatories/leiden_obs/|title=Leiden Observatory|website=www.assa.saao.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration lasted until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Piet C. van der Kruit, [[Klaas van Berkel]] |title=The Legacy of J.C.

The astronomy department moved to the science campus north-west of the city centre in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Gent|first1=Robert|title=Historical Telescopes in the Netherlands|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/telescope/telescopenl.htm#Leiden|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although professional astronomical observations are no longer carried out from Leiden itself, the department still calls itself Leiden Observatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="836">A '''light non-aqueous phase liquid''' (LNAPL) is a [[groundwater]] contaminant that is not soluble in water and has lower [[density]] than [[water]], in contrast to a [[DNAPL]] which has higher density than water. Once a LNAPL infiltrates the ground, it will stop at the height of the [[water table]] because the LNAPL is less dense than water. Efforts to locate and remove LNAPLs is relatively less expensive and easier than for DNAPLs because LNAPLs float on top of the water in the underground water table.

Examples of LNAPLs are [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylene]], and other [[hydrocarbons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">'''Ludwig Ferdinand Schiedermair''' (7 December 1876, [[Regensburg]] – 30 April 1957, [[Bensberg]]) was a German minister and [[musicologist]]. He concerned himself with opera history, [[Mozart]], and [[Beethoven]]. In 1914 he edited the first complete critical edition of the letters of Mozart and his family.

==Life==
After studying musicology in Munich and [[habilitation]] as a docent in [[Marburg]] he became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] from 1920 to 1945. As department head for music history he founded the Beethoven Archive at the [[Beethoven House]], [[Bonn]], on 26 March 1927 (the 100th anniversary of Beethoven's death) and served as its first director until 1945. He also founded the Institute for Musicology at the University of Bonn – the first such institute at a German school for higher education. He also served on the committee to found the [[Max-Reger-Institute]] which he led until 1953.

After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], he published his work ''The complete world view ideas in the Volk's music of Beethoven'' in 1934. From 1937 to 1939 he served as president of the German Society for Musicology, and in this position gave the musicological address of the ''Reichsmusiktage'' on 27 May 1938, a work of propaganda famous for its exhibition of "[[Degenerate music]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Klee| first=Ernst| title=Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich.

In the Second World War, he worked for the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]].

He retired in 1945 and in 1952 became an honored member of the Academy for Music Research.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology''' is a [[Germany|German]] institute for [[evolutionary biology]]. It is located in [[Plön]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by German zoologist [[Otto Zacharias]] as ''Hydrobiologische Station zu Plön''. Working in Italy in the 1880s, Zacharias was inspired by the highly recognised [[Stazione Zoologica]] in [[Naples]], founded in 1870 by [[Anton Dohrn]], to set up the first "Biological Station" for freshwater research in Germany. He secured financial support from the [[Prussia]]n government and several private individuals to establish it on [[Großer Plöner See]] in 1891, as a private research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, N. / Nöthlich, R.: Vom „Homo literatus“ zum „Self made man“ – Der Werdegang des Emil Otto Zacharias. In: Mauritiana, 19 (2006), No. 3, p. 463-477. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the director, Zacharias published research reports from 1893 on the Station's activities, which were recorded from 1905 in the Archives of Hydrobiology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Vol 20, Leipzig, 1909, p. 831. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so-called "summer schools" Zacharias trained teachers and laity interested in working with the [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias, O.: Ferienkurse in Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde an der Biologischen Station zu Plön, in: Archiv für Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde 4 (1909), p. 267-272. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became part of the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948, and was renamed in 1966 as the '''Max Planck Institute of Limnology'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511173229/http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html |date=2011-05-11 }} on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed again as Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in 2007, marking a change of the research focus towards [[evolutionary biology]].

[[File:Mycena leaiana var. australis.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mushrooms]] are considered a kind of fungal reproductive organism.]]

'''Mycology''' is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of [[fungus|fungi]], including their [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] properties, their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[ethnomycology|their use to humans]]  as a source for [[tinder]], [[medicine]], [[Edible mushroom|food]], and [[entheogens]], as well as their dangers, such as [[poison|toxicity]] or [[fungal infection|infection]]. 

A biologist specializing in mycology is called a '''mycologist'''.
 
Mycology branches into the field of [[phytopathology]], the study of plant diseases, and the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi.

== Overview ==
Historically, mycology was a branch of [[botany]] because, although fungi are [[evolution]]arily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not recognized until a few decades ago. Pioneer ''mycologists'' included [[Elias Magnus Fries]], [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], [[Anton de Bary]], and [[Lewis David von Schweinitz]].

Many fungi produce [[toxin]]s, [[antibiotics]], and other [[secondary metabolism|secondary metabolites]]. For example, the [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (worldwide) genus ''[[Fusarium]]'' and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by [[Abraham Joffe]].

Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as [[symbiosis|symbionts]], e.g. in the form of [[mycorrhiza]]e, [[insect]] symbionts, and [[lichen]]s.  Many fungi are able to break down complex [[organic compound|organic]] [[biomolecules]] such as [[lignin]], the more durable component of [[wood]], and pollutants such as [[xenobiotic]]s, [[petroleum]], and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.  By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the global [[carbon cycle]].

Fungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as [[oomycetes]] and myxomycetes ([[slime molds]]), often are economically and socially important, as some cause diseases of animals (such as [[histoplasmosis]]) as well as plants (such as [[Dutch elm disease]] and [[Magnaporthe grisea|Rice blast]]).

Apart from pathogenic fungi, many fungal species are very important in controlling the plant diseases caused by different pathogens. For example, species of the filamentous fungal genus ''[[Trichoderma]]'' considered as one of the most important biological control agents as an alternative to chemical based products for effective crop diseases management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruano-Rosa|first=David|last2=Prieto|first2=Pilar|last3=Rincón|first3=Ana María|last4=Gómez-Rodríguez|first4=María Victoria|last5=Valderrama|first5=Raquel|last6=Barroso|first6=Juan Bautista|last7=Mercado-Blanco|first7=Jesús|date=2015-11-07|title=Fate of ''Trichoderma harzianum'' in the olive rhizosphere: time course of the root colonization process and interaction with the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae|journal=BioControl|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=269–282|doi=10.1007/s10526-015-9706-z|issn=1386-6141|hdl=10261/157852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as 'forays', after the first such meeting organized by the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]] in 1868 and entitled "A foray among the funguses"[''sic''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anon |title=A foray among the funguses |journal=Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club |volume=1868 |year=1868 |pages=184–192 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44662#page/254/mode/1up|publisher=Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fungi can cause disease in humans and other animals - The study of [[pathogenic fungi]] that infect animals is referred to as [[pathogenic fungi|medical mycology]].&lt;ref name= SanBlasCalderone&gt;{{cite book | author = San-Blas G; Calderone RA (editors). | title = Pathogenic Fungi | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pat2 | isbn= 978-1-904455-32-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is presumed that humans started [[Mushroom hunting|collecting mushrooms]] as food in [[prehistoric]] times. Mushrooms were first written about in the works of [[Euripides]] (480-406 B.C.). The Greek philosopher [[Theophrastos]] of [[Eresos]] (371-288 B.C.) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants; mushrooms were considered to be plants missing certain organs. It was later [[Pliny the Elder]] (23&amp;ndash;79 A.D.), who wrote about [[truffles]] in his encyclopedia ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historia]]''. The word ''mycology'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: μύκης (''mukēs''), meaning "fungus" and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} (''-logia''), meaning "study".

The [[Middle Ages]] saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi. Rather, the invention of the printing press allowed some authors to disseminate superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rquote|right|Fungi and truffles are neither herbs, nor roots, nor flowers, nor seeds, but merely the superfluous moisture or earth, of trees, or rotten wood, and of other rotting things. This is plain from the fact that all fungi and truffles, especially those that are used for eating, grow most commonly in thundery and wet weather.|Jerome Bock ([[Hieronymus Tragus]])|1552&lt;ref&gt;''De stirpium maxime earum quae in Germania nostra nascuntur, usitatis nomenclaturis''. Strasbourg. In Ainsworth, p. 13, quoting Buller, AHR. (1915). Micheli and the discovery of reproduction in fungi. ''Transactions of the royal Society of Canada'', series 3 '''9''': 1&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The start of the modern age of mycology begins with [[Pier Antonio Micheli]]'s 1737 publication of ''Nova plantarum genera''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in [[Florence]], this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic [[classification (biology)|classification]] of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term ''mycology'' and the complementary ''mycologist'' were first used in 1836 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley|M.J. Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service''' ({{lang-fr|Service hydrographique et océanographique de la Marine}} or SHOM) is a French public establishment of an administrative nature ({{lang-fr|[[établissement public à caractère administratif]]}}) administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].  It is the successor to the Dépôt des cartes et plans de la Marine, founded in 1720 which became the Naval Hydrographic Service in 1886 and the Naval and Oceanographic Service in 1971. Its present form was set up by decree number 2007-800 on 11 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=DEFD0750453D Decree number 2007-800 of 11 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its board is presided over by the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]] ({{lang-fr|Chef d'État-Major de la Marine}}) and the body is directed by a director-general.

== Aims ==

This public body has several aims, including the provision of :
* a public service in [[hydrography]] and maritime [[cartography]], including the collection, elaboration, confirmation and spread of nautical information useful to civil or naval navigators and to all who sail for professional or pleasure, as well as those responsible for care of the coast
* to support the navy's hydrographers, [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s concerning specific information on maritime matters to ensure the optimal running of the navy's weapons systems (radar, sonar, infra-red sensors, carrier-borne aircraft etc.).

SHOM is made up of oceanographic and hydrographic groups, as well as a school, and employs 500 naval and civil personnel.  Its fleets consists of 5 boats: the [[French ship Beautemps-Beaupré (2002)|''Beautemps-Beaupré'']], the ''Borda'', the ''La Pérouse'', the ''Laplace'' and the ''[[Pourquoi-Pas ? (2005)|Pourquoi-Pas ?]]''.  SHOM works in cooperation with many other national organisations, including [[IFREMER]] (with whom it shares the ''Pourquoi-Pas ?''), [[Météo-France]], the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], the [[University of Western Brittany]] and the [[Institut géographique national (France)|IGN]].

The '''Paint Research Association''' is a research institute, formerly in south-west London, and now in [[Leicestershire]]. It is now known as the '''PRA'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tTs5-WSNM6AC&amp;pg=PA469 New Scientist November 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was established as the [[Research Association of British Paint, Colour and Varnish Manufacturers]] in 1926; in 1971 it changed its name to the Paint Research Association. Historically, the main paint manufacturer in the UK has been [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], under the trade name of ''[[Dulux]]''.

Its first main research institute building opened in 1936. In 2005 it moved to the Coatings Technology Centre. In 2015 it moved to Leicestershire.

==Function==
It carried out research for the government and for industry. It claims to be a '''world authority''' on [[paint]] and surface coatings.

A '''party motivator''' is a person paid to entertain attendants at a party. Typically, party motivators are attractive young men and women who dress fashionably and attempt to engage guests in socializing and dancing. Hiring party motivators is primarily a phenomenon within the [[United States|American]] upper middle and upper classes; they are especially common at [[bar mitzvah]]s.

{{Redirect|Patron||Patron (disambiguation)}}

'''Patronage''' is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another. In the history of art, '''arts patronage''' refers to the support that kings, popes, and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or [[Benefice|church benefices]], the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the [[patron saint|guardianship of saints]]. The word "patron" derives from the {{lang-la|patronus}} ("patron"), one who gives benefits to his clients (see [[Patronage in ancient Rome]]).

In some countries the term is used to describe '''political patronage''', which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint [[Senate of Canada|senators]] and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of [[Political corruption|corruption]] or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent study of political patronage in the People's Republic of China, see Hillman, Ben. [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=18534 ''Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-state Resilience in Rural China''] [[Stanford University Press]], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==

From the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] onward, patronage of the [[arts]] was important in [[art history]]. It is known in greatest detail in reference to [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe, though patronage can also be traced in [[History of Japan|feudal Japan]], the traditional [[Southeast Asia]]n kingdoms, and elsewhere—art patronage tended to arise wherever a [[royal family|royal]] or [[Empire|imperial]] system and an [[aristocracy]] dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources. [[Samuel Johnson]] defined a patron as "one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Rosenthal, ''Constable'', London: Thames and  Hudson, 1987, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulers, nobles and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions, social positions, and prestige. That is, patrons operated as [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s. Most languages other than English still use the term ''mecenate'', derived from the name of [[Gaius Maecenas]], generous friend and adviser to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Some patrons, such as the [[Medici]] of [[Florence]], used artistic patronage to "cleanse" wealth that was perceived as ill-gotten through [[usury]]. Art patronage was especially important in the creation of [[religious art]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] and later [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups sponsored art and [[architecture]], as seen in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[cathedral]]s, [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[handicraft]]s.

While sponsorship of artists and the [[commission (art)|commissioning]] of artwork is the best-known aspect of the patronage system, other disciplines also benefited from patronage, including those who studied [[natural philosophy]] ([[History of science|pre-modern]] [[science]]), [[music]]ians, [[literature|writers]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[alchemy|alchemists]], [[astrology|astrologers]], and other [[scholar]]s. Artists as diverse and important as [[Chrétien de Troyes]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Ben Jonson]] all sought and enjoyed the support of noble or ecclesiastical patrons.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Kent et al., eds.,''Patronage, Art, and Society in Renaissance Italy,'' Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cedric C. Brown, ''Patronage, Politics, and Literary traditions in England, 1558–1658,'' Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures as late as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] also participated in the system to some degree; it was only with the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the middle 19th century that European culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums, theaters, mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world.    
  
This kind of system continues across many fields of the [[arts]]. Though the nature of the sponsors has changed—from churches to charitable foundations, and from aristocrats to plutocrats—the term ''patronage'' has a more neutral [[connotation]] than in politics. It may simply refer to direct support (often financial) of an artist, for example by [[Grant (money)|grants]]. In the latter part of the 20th century, the academic sub-discipline of patronage studies began to evolve, in recognition of the important and often neglected role that the phenomenon of patronage had played in the cultural life of previous centuries.

==Charity==
Charitable and other non-profit making organisations often seek an influential figurehead to act as patron. The relationship often does not involve money. As well as conferring credibility, these people can use their contacts and charisma to assist the organisation to raise funds or to affect government policy.  The [[British Royal Family]] are especially prolific in this respect, devoting a large proportion of their time to a wide range of causes.&lt;ref name="Royal Patronage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/CharitiesandPatronages/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage.aspx|title=British Monarchy website, London.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Custom]] --&gt;
Sometimes consumers support smaller or local businesses or corporations out of loyalty even if less expensive options exist. Their regular custom is referred to as 'patronage'.  Patronage may entitle members of a [[cooperative]] to a share of the surplus or profit generated by the co-op, called a ''[[patronage refund]]''.  This refund is a form of [[dividend]].

==Ecclesiastical==
===Anglican===
:''See main article [[Parish#England|Parish]]''
In the [[Church of England]], ''patronage'' is the commonly used term for the right to present a candidate to a benefice.

===Catholic===
{{Main|ius patronatus|Cardinal nephew}}

====Patronage of Our Lady====
The [[liturgical feast]] of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by [[decree (canon law)|Decree]] of the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of [[Spain]], in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Pope [[Benedict XII]] ordered it to be kept in the [[Papal States]] on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of '''Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces'''. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the "Salve sancta parens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11560b.htm Mershman, Francis. "Feast of the Patronage of Our Lady." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterian===
The [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], (in force until 1874) resulted in multiple [[First Secession|secessions]] from the [[Church of Scotland]], including the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]], which led to the formation of the Associate Presbytery, the [[Second Secession|secession of 1761]], which led to the formation of the [[Relief Church]], and the [[Disruption of 1843]], which led to the formation of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

==Journalism==
While most news companies, particularly in North America are funded through [[advertising]] revenue,&lt;ref name="Silicon Valley Watcher"&gt;{{cite web| title =Pew: Impact Of Billionaire Funded Journalism Is Tiny| url =http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2014/03/pew_impact_of_billion.php|website=Silicon Valley Watcher|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; secondary funding sources include audience members and philanthropists who donate to for-profit and non-profit organizations.

==Politics==
[[Political leader]]s have at their disposal a great deal of patronage, in the sense that they make decisions on the appointment of [[official]]s inside and outside government (for example on [[quango]]s in the UK). Patronage is therefore a recognized  power of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]]. In most countries the executive has the right to make many appointments, some of which may be lucrative (see also [[sinecure]]s). In some [[Democracy|democracies]], high-level appointments are reviewed or approved by the [[legislature]] (as in the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]]); in other countries, such as those using the [[Westminster system]], this is not the case. Other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes, such as when political leaders engage in [[nepotism]] (hiring family members) and [[cronyism]] such as fraudulently awarding non-competitive government contracts to friends or relatives or pressuring the public service to hire an unqualified family member or friend.

===Philippines===

Political patronage, also known as "''[[Padrino System]]''" also a slang call as ''balimbing'' ([[carambola|starfruit]]), in the Philippines, has been the source of many controversies and corruption.  It has been an [[open secret]] that one cannot join the [[Politics of the Philippines|political arena of the Philippines]] without mastery of the Padrino System. From the lowest [[Barangay]] official, to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic]], it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one's career or gain influence, if not wealth.

===Russia===
After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s retirement from politics in March 1923 following a stroke, a power struggle began between [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Pravda]] editor [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Profintern]] leader [[Mikhail Tomsky]], [[Red Army]] founder [[Leon Trotsky]], former Premier [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Comintern]] leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]], and [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin used patronage to appoint many Stalinist delegates (such as [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze]], and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]) to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] [[Politburo of the CPSU|Politburo]] and [[Sovnarkom]] in order to sway the votes in his favour, making Stalin the effective leader of the country by 1929.

===South Africa===
During 2012, the African National Congress (ANC) mayor of Beaufort West in the Western Cape Province wrote a letter which openly and illegally solicited funds from the Construction Education and Training Authority for the ANC's 2016 election campaign. This episode, amongst many others including instances revolving around president Jacob Zuma, revealed how the African National Congress as ruling political party utilized patronage to reward supporters and strengthen the leading faction of the party's control over governmental institutions.&lt;ref name="dailymaveric"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-02-analysis-power-patronage-and-gatekeeper-politics-in-the-time-of-truman-prince/#.VrGtyctf0iQ |title=Power, patronage and gatekeeper politics in the time of Truman Prince|newspaper=Daily Maverick|location= Johannesburg|date= 3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Spoils system}}
In the [[United States]] during the [[Gilded Age]], patronage became a controversial issue. [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] boss [[William M. Tweed]] was an American politician who ran what is considered now to have been one of the most corrupt political machines in the country's history. Tweed and his cronies ruled for a brief time with absolute power over the city and state of New York. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in [[New York City]], a director of the [[Erie Railway]], the [[Tenth National Bank]], and the New-York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the [[Metropolitan Hotel (New York City)|Metropolitan Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Boss Tweed |last=Ackerman |first=Kenneth D. |year=2005 |publisher=Carrol &amp; Graf Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-1686-9 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nzMoAc-iew0C&amp;dq=boss+tweed&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times he was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], the New York City Board of Advisors, and the [[New York State Senate]]. In 1873, Tweed was convicted for diverting between $40 million and $200 million of public monies.&lt;ref name="gotham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20050704/202/1467 |title=Boss Tweed |newspaper=Gotham Gazette |location=New York |date=4 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090825/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20030602/4/408 |archivedate=2007-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after [[James Garfield]] became [[President of the United States|president]] in 1881,  [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disappointed office-seeker, assassinated him. To prevent further political violence and to assuage public outrage, Congress passed the [[Pendleton Act]] in 1883, which set up the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. Henceforth, applicants for most federal government jobs would have to pass an examination. Federal politicians' influence over bureaucratic appointments waned, and patronage declined as a national political issue.

Beginning in 1969, a Supreme Court case in Chicago, [[Michael L. Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County]], occurred involving political patronage and its constitutionality.  Shakman claimed that much of the patronage going on in Chicago politics was unlawful on the grounds of the first and fourteenth amendments.  Through a series of legal battle and negotiations, the two parties agreed upon [[Shakman Decrees|The Shakman Decrees]].  Under these decrees it was declared that the employment status of most public employees could not be affected positively or negatively based on political allegiance, with exceptions for politically inclined positions.  The case is still in negotiation today, as there are points yet to be decided.&lt;ref name=chic&gt;{{cite web| title =Shakman Decrees| website=Encyclopedia of Chicago| url =http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1138.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite web| title =The Shakman Decrees| website =Cook FP Shakman| url =http://www.cookfpshakman.com/background.html| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130826024721/http://cookfpshakman.com/background.html| archivedate =2013-08-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leagle&gt;{{cite web| title =SHAKMAN v. DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION OF COOK CTY| website=Leagle| url =http://www.leagle.com/decision/19791796481FSupp1315_11605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political patronage is not always considered corrupt. In the United States, the U.S. Constitution provides the president with the power to appoint individuals to government positions. He or she also may appoint personal advisers without congressional approval. Not surprisingly, these individuals tend to be supporters of the president. Similarly, at the state and local levels, governors and mayors retain appointments powers. Some scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes, such as the "recognition" of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high-profile positions. Bearfield has argued that patronage be used for four general purposes: create or strengthen a political organization; achieve democratic or egalitarian goals; bridge political divisions and create coalitions; and to alter the existing patronage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Science==
There are historical examples where the noble classes financed scientific pursuits.

Many [[Barmakids]] were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Indian science and scholarship from the neighbouring [[Academy of Gundishapur]] into the Arabic world. They patronized scholars such as [[Gebir]] and [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]]. They are also credited with the establishment of the first [[paper mill]] in Baghdad. The power of the Barmakids in those times is reflected in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''; the vizier Ja'far appears in several stories, as well as a tale that gave rise to the expression "Barmecide feast".

{{quote|We know of Yahya b Khalid al Barmaki (805) as a patron of physicians and, specifically, of the translation of Hindu medical works into both Arabic and Persian. In all likelihood however, his activity took place in the orbit of the caliphal court in Iraq, where at the behest of Harun al Rashid (786 -809), such books were translated into Arabic. Thus Khurasan and Transoxania were effectively bypassed in this transfer of learning from India to Islam, even though, undeniably the Barmakis cultural outlook owed something to their land of origin, northern Afghanistan, and Yahya al Barmaki's interest in medicine may have derived from no longer identifiable family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia|volume=4, Part 2 |authors=Bosworth, C. E. Bosworth&amp; Asimov, M.S.| page =300}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sports==
In the same manner as commercial patronage, those who attend a sporting event may be referred to as patrons, though the usage in much of the world is now considered archaic—with some notable exceptions.  Those who attend the [[Masters Tournament]], one of the four major championship of professional [[golf]], are still traditionally referred to as "patrons," largely at the insistence of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. This insistence is occasionally made fun of by [[sportswriter]]s and other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0,28136,1607332,00.html Davis, Seth: The difference between patrons and fans, Golf.com, April 6 2007.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015081922/http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0%2C28136%2C1607332%2C00.html |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[polo]], a "patron" is a person who puts together a team by hiring one or more professionals. The rest of the team may be amateurs, often including the patron himself (or, increasingly, herself).

Also, people who attend [[hurling]] or [[Gaelic football]] games organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] are referred to as patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">In [[thermal equilibrium]], each [[phase (matter)|phase]] (i.e. [[liquid]], [[solid]] etc.) of physical [[matter]] comes to an end at a transitional point, or spatial [[interface (matter)|interface]], called a '''phase boundary''', due to the [[immiscibility]] of the matter with the matter on the other side of the boundary.  This immiscibility is due to at least one difference between the two substances' corresponding physical properties. The behavior of phase boundaries has been a developing subject of interest and an active research field, called interface science, in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] for almost two centuries, due partly to phase boundaries naturally arising in many physical processes, such as the [[capillarity effect]], the growth of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]], the physics of [[binary alloy]]s, and the formation of [[snow flake]]s. 

One of the oldest problems in the area dates back to Lamé and Clapeyron&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Lamé|G. Lamé]], [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron|B. P. Clapeyron]], Memoire sur la solidification par refroiddissement d'un globe solide, Ann. Chem. Physics, 47, 250–256  (1831).&lt;/ref&gt; who studied the freezing of the ground. Their goal was to determine the thickness of solid crust generated by the cooling of a liquid at constant [[temperature]] filling the [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]. In 1889, Stefan, while working on the freezing of the ground developed these ideas further and formulated the two-phase model which came to be known as the [[Stefan problem | Stefan Problem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josef Stefan|J. Stefan]], Über einige Probleme der Theorie der Warmeleitung, S.-B Wien Akad. Mat. Natur, 98, 173–484, (1889).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof of existence and uniqueness of a solution to the [[Stefan problem]] was done in many stages. Proving the general existence and uniqueness of the solutions in the case of &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt; was solved by [[Shoshana Kamin]].

The term population ecology is often used interchangeably with [[population biology]] or [[population dynamics]]. 

The development of population ecology owes much to [[demography]] and [[actuary|actuarial]] [[life table]]s. Population ecology is important in [[conservation biology]], especially in the development of [[population viability analysis]] (PVA) which makes it possible to predict the long-term probability of a species persisting in a given habitat patch. Although population ecology is a subfield of [[biology]], it provides interesting problems for [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[statistics|statisticians]] who work in [[population dynamics]].

The most fundamental law of population ecology is [[Thomas Malthus]]' exponential law of population growth.&lt;ref name="Turchin01"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Turchin  | first = P.  | title = Does Population Ecology Have General Laws?  | journal = Oikos

''A population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant.''&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;{{rp|18}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus Wellcome L0069037 -crop.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Thomas Robert Malthus]]]]

This principle in population ecology provides the basis for formulating predictive theories and tests that follow:

Simplified population models usually start with four key variables (four '''demographic processes''') including death, birth, immigration, and emigration. Mathematical models used to calculate changes in population demographics and evolution hold the assumption (or [[null hypothesis]]) of no external influence. Models can be more mathematically complex where "...several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data."&lt;ref name="Johnson04"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Johnson  | first = J. B.  | last2 = Omland  | first2 = K. S.  | title = Model selection in ecology and evolution.  | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution  | volume = 19  | issue = 2  | pages = 101–108  | year = 2004  | url = http://www.usm.maine.edu/bio/courses/bio621/model_selection.pdf  | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2003.10.013  | pmid = 16701236  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a closed system where immigration and emigration does not take place, the rate of change in the number of individuals in a population can be described as:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = B - D = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''B'' is the '''raw''' number of births, ''D'' is the '''raw''' number of deaths, ''b'' and ''d'' are the '''per capita''' rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the '''per capita''' average number of surviving offspring each individual has. This formula can be read as the rate of change in the population (''dN/dT'') is equal to births minus deaths (B - D).&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Vandermeer  | first = J.

Using these techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a mathematical model known as the [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|logistic equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = aN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the biomass density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula can be read as follows: the rate of change in the population (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity ''(1-N/K)''. From these basic mathematical principles the discipline of population ecology expands into a field of investigation that queries the [[demographics]] of real populations and tests these results against the statistical models. The field of population ecology often uses data on life history and matrix algebra to develop projection matrices on fecundity and survivorship. This information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas &lt;ref name="Vandermeer03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berryman92"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Berryman  | first = A.

[[File:The general difference between populations that grow exponentially and geometrically.png|400px|thumb|'''The general difference between populations that grow exponentially and geometrically.'''
 Geometric populations grow in reproductive generations between intervals of [[abstinence]] from reproduction. Exponential populations grow without designated periods for reproduction. Reproduction is a [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] process and generations of reproduction overlap. This graph illustrates two hypothetical populations - one population growing periodically (and therefore geometrically) and the other population growing continuously (and therefore exponentially). The populations in the graph have a doubling time of 1 year. The populations in the graph are hypothetical. In reality, the doubling times differ between populations.]]

'''Assumption 02''': There is no migration to or from the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;)

&lt;big&gt;'''I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;  = E&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

The '''raw''' birth and death rates are related to the '''per capita''' birth and death rates:

&lt;big&gt;'''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; × N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''d&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Assumption 03''': '''b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''d&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' are constant (i.e. they don't change each generation).

If bacterial populations could grow indefinitely (which they do not) then the number of bacteria in each species would approach infinity ('''∞'''). However, the percentage of ''G. stearothermophilus'' bacteria out of all the bacteria would approach '''100%''' whilst the percentage of ''E. coli'' and ''N. meningitidis'' combined out of all the bacteria would approach '''0%'''. This graph is a [[simulation]] of this hypothetical scenario. In reality, bacterial populations do not grow indefinitely in size and the 3 species require different optimal conditions to bring their doubling times to minima.

]]

The [[doubling time]] of a population is the time required for the population to grow to twice its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Doubling Time and How is it Calculated?|first=Lauren|last=Boucher|date=24 March 2015|website=Population Education|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/what-doubling-time-and-how-it-calculated}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can calculate the [[doubling time]] of a geometric population using the equation: &lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;) is twice its size (&lt;big&gt;2N&lt;/big&gt;) after the doubling time.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;/big&gt;'''

The doubling time can be found by taking logarithms. For instance:

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) = 1'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = 1'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

Or:

&lt;big&gt;'''t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; × ln(λ) = ln(2)'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = ln(2) / ln(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.693... / ln(λ)&lt;/big&gt;'''

Therefore:

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = 0.693... / ln(λ) &lt;/big&gt;'''

=== Half-life of geometric populations ===

The [[half-life]] of a population is the time taken for the population to decline to half its size. We can calculate the half-life of a geometric population using the equation: &lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population (&lt;big&gt;N&lt;/big&gt;) is half its size (&lt;big&gt;0.5N&lt;/big&gt;) after a half-life.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''0.5N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; × N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / log&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = ln(0.5) / ln(λ) &lt;/big&gt;'''

===Mathematical relationship between geometric and exponential populations===

In geometric populations, &lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;λ&lt;/big&gt; represent growth constants (see [[Population ecology#Geometric populations|2]] and [[Population ecology#Geometric .28R.29 and finite .28.CE.BB.29 growth constants|2.3]]). In [[exponential growth|exponential]] populations however, the [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic growth rate]], also known as [[Population dynamics#Intrinsic rate of increase|intrinsic rate of increase]] (&lt;big&gt;r&lt;/big&gt;) is the relevant growth constant. Since generations of reproduction in a geometric population do not overlap (e.g. reproduce once a year) but do in an exponential population, geometric and exponential populations are usually considered to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Growth|website=[[University of Alberta]]|url=http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/courses.hp/bio208/Lecture_Notes_files/Biol208_Lecture19_PopulationGrowth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geometric constants and exponential constants share the mathematical relationship below.&lt;ref name="afrc.uamont.edu"/&gt;

The growth equation for exponential populations is

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Therefore:

'''&lt;big&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;'''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; cancels on both sides.

'''&lt;big&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; / N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Take the [[natural logarithm]]s of the equation. Using natural logarithms instead of base 10 or base 2 logarithms simplifies the final equation as ln(e) = 1.

Migrants moving among the patches are structured into metapopulations either as sources or sinks. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of migrants to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants. In metapopulation terminology there are emigrants (individuals that leave a patch) and immigrants (individuals that move into a patch). Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer questions about spatial and demographic ecology. An important concept in metapopulation ecology is the rescue effect, where small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. Metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks, such as dry years, and become sources when conditions are more favorable. Ecologists utilize a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.&lt;ref name="Hanski04"&gt;{{Cite book  | editor-last = Hanski  | editor-first = I.  | editor2-last = Gaggiotti  | editor2-first = O.

==History==
The older term, autecology (from Greek: αὐτο, ''auto'', "self"; οίκος, oikos, "household"; and λόγος, logos, "knowledge"), refers to roughly the same field of study as population ecology. It derives from the division of ecology into autecology—the study of individual species in relation to the environment—and [[Community ecology|synecology]]—the study of groups of organisms in relation to the environment—or community ecology. Odum (1959, p.&amp;nbsp;8) considered that synecology should be divided into population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology, defining autecology as essentially "species ecology."&lt;ref name="Odum1959"/&gt; However, for some time biologists have recognized that the more significant level of organization of a species is a population, because at this level the species gene pool is most coherent. In fact, Odum regarded "autecology" as no longer a "present tendency" in ecology (i.e., an archaic term), although included "species ecology"—studies emphasizing [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and behavior as adaptations to the environment of individual organisms or species—as one of four subdivisions of ecology.

==Journals==
The first journal publication of the Society of Population Ecology, titled ''Population Ecology'' (originally called ''Researches on Population Ecology'') was released in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.springerlink.com/content/1438-3896?sortorder=asc&amp;p=93932389f9764a2aadcbe167b466fcef&amp;o=0|title= Population Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific articles on population ecology can also be found in the ''[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]'', ''[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]]'' and other journals.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''predicate''' is commonly understood to be a [[Boolean-valued function]] ''P'': ''X''→ {true, false}, called the predicate on ''X''. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], then a predicate is simply the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] (otherwise known as the [[indicator function]]) of a relation.  However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on [[set theory]], and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.

==Simplified overview==
Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Daniel W.|title=A Logical Introduction to Proof|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461436317|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIf3CkTPPjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haas|first=Guy M.|title=What If? (Predicates)|url=http://www.bfoit.org/itp/Predicates.html|work=Introduction to Computer Programming|publisher=Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in IT (BFOIT)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, predicates are sometimes used to indicate set membership: when talking about sets, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements. Thus, a predicate ''P(x)'' will be true or false, depending on whether ''x'' belongs to a set.

Predicates are also commonly used to talk about the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of objects, by defining the set of all objects that have some property in common. So, for example, when ''P'' is a predicate on ''X'', one might sometimes say ''P'' is a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of ''X''.  Similarly, the notation ''P''(''x'') is used to denote a sentence or statement ''P'' concerning the variable object x. The set defined by ''P''(''x'') is written as {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, and is the set of objects for which ''P'' is true.

For instance, {''x'' | ''x'' is a natural number less than 4} is the set {1,2,3}.

If ''t'' is an element of the set {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, then the statement ''P''(''t'') is ''true''.

Here, ''P''(''x'') is referred to as the ''predicate'', and ''x'' the ''placeholder'' of the ''[[proposition]]''. Sometimes, ''P''(''x'') is also called a ([[Template processor|template]] in the role of)  [[propositional function]], as each choice of the placeholder ''x'' produces a proposition.

A simple form of predicate is a [[Boolean expression]], in which case the inputs to the expression are themselves Boolean values, combined using Boolean operations. Similarly, a Boolean expression with inputs predicates is itself a more complex predicate.

== Formal definition==
The precise semantic interpretation of an [[atomic formula]] and an atomic sentence will vary from theory to theory.

* In [[propositional logic]], atomic formulas are called [[propositional variable]]s.&lt;ref name=lavrov&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrov|first=Igor Andreevich|first2=Larisa|last2=Maksimova|author2-link= Larisa Maksimova |title=Problems in Set Theory, Mathematical Logic, and the Theory of Algorithms|year=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0306477122|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPLjjjU1C9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-[[arity]]) predicates. 
* In [[first-order logic]], an atomic formula consists of a predicate symbol applied to an appropriate number of terms. 
* In [[set theory]], predicates are understood to be [[Indicator function|characteristic functions]] or set [[indicator function]]s, ''i.e.'' [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set element to a [[truth value]].  [[Set-builder notation]] makes use of predicates to define sets.
* In [[autoepistemic logic]], which rejects the [[law of excluded middle]], predicates may be true, false, or simply ''unknown''; ''i.e.'' a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.
* In [[fuzzy logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21819">'''The psychology of film''' is a sub-field of the [[psychology of art]] that studies the characteristics of [[film]] and its production in relation to [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[narrative]] understanding, and [[emotion]]. A growing number of psychological scientists and brain scientists have begun conducting empirical studies that describe the cognitive and biological underpinnings of motion pictures or what has been called "psychocinematics".&lt;ref name=Shimamura&gt;{{cite book|last=Shimamura|first=Arthur P. (Editor)|title=Psychocinematics: Exploring Cognition at the Movies|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early theoretical approaches included works by psychologists [[Hugo Münsterberg]]&lt;ref name="Münsterberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Münsterberg|first=Hugo|title=The Photoplay. A psychological study|year=1916|publisher= Appleton.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Arnheim]].&lt;ref name=Arnheim&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Film as Art: 50th Anniversary Printing|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive film theorists [[David Bordwell]] and [[Noël Carroll]] fostered its philosophical underpinnings.

==Sensory Features==
Film is rather unusual as it involves an integration of visual and auditory stimuli. In [[Fictional film|narrative films]], plots are guided by camera placement and movement, dialogue, sound effects, and editing. Some aspects of film are driven by bottom-up or sensory guided factors (such as light, motion or sound), whereas other aspects depend more on top-down or conceptually driven factors, like past experiences and internal motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Whan|author2=Daniel C. Smith |title=Product Level Choice: A Top-Down or Bottom-Up Process?|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1989|volume=16|issue=3|pages=289–299|doi=10.1086/209215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===

Cuts and flashbacks represent types of editing that alter the normal temporal sequencing of events, creating non-linear narrative structures. Editing creates the transition between events. Research focusing on recall ability for linear versus non-linear narratives suggests that temporal changes impact memory of events, but not comprehension.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Phillip J.|author2=Durkin, Kevin |title=The effect of flashback on children's understanding of television crime content|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=1 January 1999|volume=43|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1080/08838159909364476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film cuts are instantaneous, perceptual, and sometimes temporal discontinuities that do not exist in our own realities. However, despite this, viewers accept cuts as a natural storytelling technique in film. Even though we see reality in a continuous flow of linked images, in movies, cuts seem to work, regardless of how experienced a viewer is. [[Walter Murch]] suggests that this is because viewers are in fact used to cuts in their everyday lives through the act of [[blinking]]. When you turn to look at an object, for example, you normally blink, thus creating a visual break in continuity between what you ''were'' looking at and what you are now looking at. Another possibility that Murch explores to explain humans’ innate acceptance of film cuts is the way in which we [[dream]]. Our dreams tend to jump around from place to place and situation to situation without any real sense of continuity. Thus the [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] nature of [[film]]s is familiar to viewers and allows them to innately understand the [[editing]] despite discontinuities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33334569|title=In the blink of an eye : a perspective on film editing|last=1943-|first=Murch, Walter,|date=1995|publisher=Silman-James Press|isbn=9781879505230|edition= 1st |location=Los Angeles|oclc=33334569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwan &amp; Ildirar (2010), who focused solely on inexperienced viewers’ ability to comprehend film, found that the comprehensibility of films was determined by whether or not they followed a familiar line of action. Overall, our brains accept the perceptual discontinuities found in films, but it is ultimately easier for viewers, regardless of their experience, to understand cuts that follow a continuous and familiar line of action as opposed to ones that are more discontinuous. When a familiar line is not present, more experienced viewers are significantly better at comprehending a complex narrative by “filtering” out editing discontinuities.&lt;ref name="schwan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=S.|author2=Ildirar, S.|date=7 June 2010|title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=7|pages=970–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, however, [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] linearity that creates temporal continuity is more important than [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] for recall and understanding of a [[Narrative structure|narrative’s]] events.[[Psychology of film#cite note-cowen-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Sequence of events===

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] research demonstrates that some movies can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. Studying the neuroscience of film is based on the hypothesis that some films, or film segments, lead viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual, emotional and cognitive states. Using [[fMRI]] brain imaging, researchers asked participants to watch 30 minutes of [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] (1966) as they lay on their backs in the MRI scanner. Despite the seemingly uncontrolled task and complex nature of the stimulus, brain activity was similar across viewers’ brains, particularly in spatiotemporal areas. When compared to a random sequence of scenes, the specific order of events seemed to be strongly associated with this similarity in brain activity. It was also determined that the level of control a movie has on someone’s mental state is highly dependent upon the cinematic devices (pans, cuts and close-ups) it contains. Tightly edited films exert more control on brain activity and eye-movement than open-ended films. However, similar eye-movement and similarity in visual processing does not guarantee similar brain responses.&lt;ref name=hasson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasson|first=Uri|author2=Landesman, Ohad |author3=Knappmeyer, Barbara |author4=Vallines, Ignacio |author5=Rubin, Nava |author6= Heeger, David J. |title=Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film|journal=Projections|date=30 August 2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.3167/proj.2008.020102|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.2650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the average correlation in taste between individual viewers is rather low and not well predicted by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3167/proj.2017.110107|title = Strikingly Low Agreement in the Appraisal of Motion Pictures|journal = Projections|volume = 11|year = 2017|last1 = Wallisch|first1 = Pascal|last2 = Alden Whritner|first2 = Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spatial Information===

Viewing spaces on screen from a stable point of view is important for short-term spatial coding and long term spatial memory. Long-time viewers of the television show ''[[Friends]]'' were significantly better at accurately recalling spatial information about the show's set, because the camera never moves away from the "[[fourth wall]]". Equally experienced viewers of the show "[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]" were less likely to recall information about the set and be able to mentally orient themselves inside it, because the show is filmed from many different angles.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Daniel T.|author2=Wang, Caryn |title=Spatial Representation in Cognitive Science and Film|journal=Projections|date=1 June 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–52|doi=10.3167/proj.2009.030103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study,&lt;ref name=hirose&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Yoriko|title=Perception and memory across viewpoint changes in moving images|journal=Journal of Vision|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1167/10.4.2|pmid=20465322}}&lt;/ref&gt; observers were instructed to look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that did not appear to affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, observers were more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, they were more likely to describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of continuity errors in editing.&lt;ref name="hirose"/&gt;

===Cinematic techniques===

Cinematic techniques are often regarded as grammatical structures or components of the cinematic art as a language made up of images.&lt;ref name=Messaris94&gt;{{cite book|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=Visual "Literacy": Image, Mind, Reality|year=1994|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A period of visual adaptation is necessary before being able to understand images in movies or on [[television]].  Viewers need sufficient exposure to cinematic techniques and the meanings attributed to them to adequately interpret the images on the screen. At a very young age, we learn how to watch videos and understand different editing techniques. One study looked at adult participants who had very little exposure to film to see if they were able to understand simple editing techniques, such as [[point of view shot]]s, [[establishing shot]]s, [[Panning (camera)|pan shots]], [[Shot reverse shot|shot/reverse shot]], ellipsis of time, and [[cross-cutting]]. These viewers were able to understand some of the techniques, such as ellipses of time; however, more complex techniques, like shot/reverse shot were more difficult for them to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=Stephan|author2=Sermin Ildirar |title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Association for Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=7|pages=969–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[filmmaking]] techniques derive meaning through past experiences or [[Ideology|ideologies]] that influence the way viewers see certain images or sequence of images. An example of this would be how [[camera angle]]s can affect our perception of what is occurring on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baranowski|first=Andreas|last2=Hecht|first2=Heiko|date=2017-05-30|title=Effect of Camera Angle on Perception of Trust and Attractiveness|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317237444|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=36|pages=90–100|doi=10.1177/0276237417710762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low angle shots in which the camera is pointed up at a subject tend to make the subject appear more powerful or stronger. While high angle shots can make a subject appear weaker. These interpretations of [[camera angle]]s, however, ultimately derive from the notion that bigger is better. The lateral movement of a subject across the screen can also influence an audience's interpretation of the subject.  For example, characters that move from left-to-right are perceived more positively than characters who move right-to-left. This partiality toward rightward movement likely has its roots in the predominance of right-handedness in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L Egizii|first=Matthew|last2=Denny|first2=James|last3=Neuendorf|first3=Kimberly|last4=D Skalski|first4=Paul|last5=Campbell|first5=Rachel|date=2012-05-01|title=Which Way Did He Go? Directionality of Film Character and Camera Movement and Subsequent Spectator Interpretation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the practice of reading left-to-right in [[Western Romance languages|Western languages]].

====Changes in film techniques====

One study compiled data on the changing trends in techniques by examining 160 English-language films released from 1935-2010.&lt;ref name=cutting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutting|first=James E|author2=Brunick, Kaitlin L |author3=DeLong, Jordan E |author4=Iricinschi, Catalina |author5= Candan, Ayse |title=Quicker, faster, darker: Changes in Hollywood film over 75 years|journal=I-Perception|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=569–576|doi=10.1068/i0441aap|pmid=23145246|pmc=3485803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;  The findings demonstrate that over time shot lengths have become shorter, while the shorter the shot the more motion it is likely to contain. In addition, contemporary films have significantly more motion and movement than older ones. Motion is the optical change created by moving objects, people, and shadows; movement is that change created by camera motion or gradual lens change.
Presumably, the film industry has capitalized on the results of previous psychological research that shows motion and the onset of motion capture our attention.&lt;ref name=hillstrom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillstrom|first=Anne P.|author2=Yantis, Steven |title=Visual motion and attentional capture|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1 July 1994|volume=55|issue=4|pages=399–411|doi=10.3758/BF03205298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, films have become darker over time, as the overall brightness of the images on the movie screen has decreased.&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;

These changes in film-making choices increase attention manipulation and are thought to facilitate comprehension.

==Top-down factors==
Top-down factors refer to expectations and background knowledge that influence viewers' perception, understanding and appreciation of film. Expertise, attention and eye-movements are top-down factors that guide how viewers experience film.

===Expertise and awareness of audience manipulation===

Explicit awareness about the processes by which meaning is created by the visual media could be regarded as one measure of film expertise and sophistication. Increased awareness of the subtle techniques employed by filmmakers to “manipulate” audiences leads to increased admiration and aesthetic responses to film,&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=L.|title=Art as the communication of competence|journal=Social Science Information|date=1 December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=115–141|doi=10.1177/053901847301200604}}&lt;/ref&gt;   as in other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=D.W.|title=When the Movies Were Young|year=1975|publisher=Benjamin Blom|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Researchers have identified a strong relationship between prior film experience and conscious awareness of visual manipulations, especially for people with practical experience in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Sol|title=Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film Communication and Anthropology|year=1972|publisher=Indiana University Press.|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the participants’ ability to understand narrative in Hollywood versus experimental film, by measuring interpretational awareness. Subjects with significant, moderate and no formal background or experience in film viewed a film that contained both scenes with Hollywood-style and experimental-style editing. Regardless of expertise level, participants described the Hollywood-like scenes in “naturalistic terms,” as if their events had occurred in reality and tended not to make explicit references to stylistic techniques. This interpretational tendency reflects Hollywood’s “invisible style.” When describing the experimental scenes, inexperienced viewers struggled to construct a cohesive “naturalistic” narrative. More experienced viewers were more likely to make explicit reference to the “breaking of conventions” and the intentions behind them.&lt;ref name=messaris81&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=The Film Audience's Awareness of the Production Process|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|year=1981|volume=33|issue=4|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film editing seems to be a barrier of awareness for conventional Hollywood-type movies, as they create an illusion of “real life”.

===Segmentation===

Segmentation or event segmentation is a fundamental component of attention that facilitates understanding, object recognition and planning. Event segmentation constitutes breaking down dynamic scenes into spatial and temporal parts or units of events.

Event segmentation is viewed as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.”&lt;ref name=zacksj /&gt; 
It is considered to be an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived at the end of one event and the beginning of another.&lt;ref name=zacksj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=J|title=Human Brain Activity Time-locked to Perceptual Event Boundaries|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=4|pages=651–655|doi=10.1038/88486|pmid=11369948|year=2001|last2=Braver|first2=TS|last3=Sheridan|first3=MA|last4=Donaldson|first4=DI|last5=Snyder|first5=AZ|last6=Ollinger|first6=JM|last7=Buckner|first7=RL|last8=Raichle|first8=ME|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Event Segmentation Theory (EST),&lt;ref name=zacks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Swallow, Khena M. |author4=Braver, Todd S. |author5= Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Event perception: A mind-brain perspective|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=273–293|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.273|pmid=17338600|pmc=2852534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the perception of event boundaries is a side effect of prediction during ongoing perception. Prediction is an adaptive mechanism made up of cognitive event models that represent “what is going on now” to create expectations and attentive biases for ongoing processing. Prediction errors occur at situational changes and cause information processing segmentation.

Broader narrative comprehension theories have also been applied to the perception and memory of movies.&lt;ref name=zacks2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Segmentation in reading and film comprehension|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2009|volume=138|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1037/a0015305|pmid=19397386|citeseerx=10.1.1.496.1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects the hypothesis that the same mechanisms are used to understanding stories and real life. In one study, researchers illustrated the common episodic structure between text and film, by asking participants to match a constructed text story to the dialogueless movie [[The Red Balloon]]. This task required participants to locate episodes and their components within the cinematic story: exposition, complication and resolution.&lt;ref name=baggett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baggett|first=Patricia|title=Structurally equivalent stories in movie and text and the effect of the medium on recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=1 June 1979|volume=18|issue=3|pages=333–356|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(79)90191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-movement===

Using an [[Eye tracking|eyetracker]], researchers have discovered a strong center-of-screen bias with a distribution of gaze points approximately peaking at the screen center. However, eye gazes rarely focus on the same location. Visual dispersion across the screen increases over time and particularly, after repeated exposure to the same video stimulus. Because of this, there is greater gaze dispersion when viewers are watching advertisements compared to a television show.&lt;ref name=brasel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasel|first=S Adam|author2=Gips, James |title=Points of view: Where do we look when we watch TV?|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2008|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1890–1894|doi=10.1068/p6253|pmid=19227380|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230036|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driver|first=J.|title=Parietal neglect and visual awareness|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–22|year=1998|doi=10.1038/217|pmid=10195103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theologians]] however have questioned the utility of an approach to religion by way of a so-called instinct;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Berkhof, ''Systematic Theology'' (1996) p. 111-2&lt;/ref&gt;[[psychologists]] have disputed the existence of any such specific [[instinct]];&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Pratt, ''The Religious Consciousness'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  while others would point to the advance of [[secularization]] in the modern world as refuting the assumption of a specific religious instinct inevitably leading to the establishment of religion as a fundamental human institution.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
{{main|Paleolithic religion}}
There are no religious [[ritual]]s observed in animals, including our close relatives, chimpanzees and other apes, although chimps were observed to have sometimes collective excitements for no reason.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/Alcorta_Sosis,_Signals_and_rituals_of_humans_and_animals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologists have established the existence of [[Funeral|burial rituals]] among [[Neanderthal]]s some 50,000 years ago:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDHsE_Efy0EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=NEANderthal+religious+rituals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiAUESD11q&amp;sig=Wc-0NamAlVujLYC6fwaxW9ku6ZM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZFu4TMDmHMP38AaX8I3DDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Prayer: A History| authors=Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-618-77360-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their appearance has sometimes been taken as evidence of the human capacity to ''transform'' instinct, rather than to be driven by it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and Jung==
[[Sigmund Freud]] saw human weakness and helplessness as a fundamental force behind the establishment of religion&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; - a view which might seem to draw support from the [[World Values Survey|Inglehart-Welzel]] thesis that links the insecurities of traditional economies to a search for spiritual certainty, the affluence of modernisation to a declining stress on religion.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Foster, ''Luck of the Irish'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) theorized the existence of a [[collective unconscious]], as a residue of what has been learned in humankind's evolution and ancestral past, which contains the instinctual potential for [[creativity]] as well as the spiritual heritage of mankind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22596676/Jung-and-Religion-The-Opposing-Self| title=Jung and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which unconsciously dictates our behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=John |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780892540495 |title=Jung's Thoughts on God: The Religious Depths of Our Psyches (Jung on the Hudson Book Series) by Donald Dyer - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he recognized in man a genetic predisposition to order experience in mythological, religious or symbolic terms,&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Jung reserved judgement as to what bearing this had for the truth-value of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 75-82&lt;/ref&gt; 

He never ceased however to stress the important challenge all such factors presented to any shallowly rationalistic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p.90-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Durkheim]] saw the social, not the instinctual side of mankind as the key to their religious experience.&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex for Fish''' sometimes referred to as "Fish for Sex" is a phenomenon in which female traders engage in sexual relationships with fishermen to secure their supply of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.05.010 |title=Women and Fish-for-Sex: Transactional Sex, HIV/AIDS and Gender in African Fisheries |year=2008 |last1=Béné |first1=Christophe |last2=Merten |first2=Sonja |journal=World Development |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=875–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women fish traders are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply them with daily fresh fish. Along the beaches where the sex for fish practices have been observed, the fishermen do maintain several transactional sexual relationships with women at different beaches where they land with their fish.
 
Sex for Fish as a phenomenon is common in many low and middle income developing countries; however, the bulk cases have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa’s inland fisheries. The most vulnerable victims are economically disadvantaged women, e.g. single or divorced women as well as widows residing in along the shores of inland fisheries centers.

Several social-economic factors including poverty, cultural practices, and competition among women who are involved in fish trade are often listed as variables fueling the sex for fish practice. There is no conclusive research that shows what promotes sex for fish practice, however, fishermen seem to be taking advantage of stiff competition between the women who trade in fish to demand sexual favors in exchange for the fish. The men or the trader who receives sexual favors would grant preferential sale and sale at reduced prices to these women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cg7UT6fBpk |title=Sex for Fish - Kenya |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Kenya]], women have been observed giving out empty polythene bags to the fishermen before they go out fishing at night or early morning, and when the fishermen return, some of the best catch would be set aside for them, stashed in these bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/aeap.2013.25.3.216 |title=Jaboyavs.Jakambi: Status, Negotiation, and HIV Risks Among Female Migrants in the "Sex for Fish" Economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya |year=2013 |last1=Camlin |first1=Carol S. |last2=Kwena |first2=Zachary A. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Shari L. |journal=AIDS Education and Prevention |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=216–31 |pmid=23631716 |pmc=3717412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishermen take advantage of these economically and social disadvantaged women by offering preferential treatment in fish business in exchange for sex.

==Poverty==
In Kenya where sex for fish has been well documented, poverty among the fishing communities has been constantly listed as factors contributing to the practice of sex for fish. Sex for fish practice in Kenya is popularly referred to as Jaboya system. Jaboya in Luo tribe dialect means customer, however, due to the transactional involvement of fishermen with women fish traders, the locals coined the term Jaboya system to refer to sex for fish phenomenon. Fishmongers in lake side city of [[Kisumu]], have sex with fishermen to get stock to sell in order to make a living. They have alluded to having children to feed and having to pay rent and school fees as drivers for exchange of sex for fish. In Kenya’s third largest city of Kisumu, Dunga Beach along the shores of Lake Victoria young girls have become the new attraction for fishermen who use their fish catch as a bait to lure these vulnerable group into sex for fish practice fees.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/country/ke/kenya |title=IRIN &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; East Africa &amp;#124; Kenya |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of poverty and vulnerable ensures that older women introduces their younger daughters or orphaned girls to sex for fish trade. In return the young girl sleeps with the fisherman that offers the best deal. In many cases the young girls do have sex with multiple partners and are exposed to STD’s and potentially HIV infections.&lt;ref name="irinnews1" /&gt;

==Exploitation of gay men==
In September 2012, a Kenyan TV station reported incidents where gay men exchange sex for fish. This occurs due to poor catch or for money. The economically weak gay men have been become the latest group to be involved in sex for fish within the fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |title=Anal Sex For Fish In Kisumu: The Invisible Bridge Final Part |publisher=Identitykenya.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217090019/http://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS prevalence==
Some of the earliest recorded cases of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa were in fishing communities around Lake Victoria in 1982. Several studies have shown a link between sex for fish phenomenon and higher HIV prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qui1whVeqX4 |title=Sex for fish: How fishing is fueling the spread of HIV/Aids in Homabay |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-12-26 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kenya]], it is assumed that ‘Sex for Fish’ contributes to the high HIV/AIDS prevalence along the lake region, where it is double the national average.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtzpsda.co.ke/download.php?filename=psda_downloads/_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf&amp;name=_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf |title=Omena fishery and 'Sex for Fish' at Lake Victoria |publisher=Gtzpsda.co.ke |accessdate=2013-11-23 |author=Dr. Iris Menn and Elizabeth Anyango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya Modes of Transmission Study 2008 had put prevalence in the fishing communities at between 25 percent and 30 percent in Nyanza province in Kenya.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt; This prevalence level was double Nyanza province in general infection rate of 15.3 percent, which was nearly the national average. The effect of HIV transmission is made worse by the fact that these women have no control over the use of condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of the HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

In [[Uganda]], studies conducted around [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Edward]] by the [[Uganda Fisheries and Fish Conservation Association]] (UFFCA), found that the HIV/AIDS prevalence average rate was at 22.4 percent against the national prevalence of 7.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancap.org/en/news-global/1723-uganda-sex-for-fish-common-as-hiv-reaches-22-percent.html |title=Uganda: 'Sex for Fish' Common As HIV Reaches 22 Percent |publisher=Pancap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex for fish is considered by many leaders and researchers as one of the reasons that have led to higher than average HIV/AIDS prevalence amongst these fisher communities.

In [[Mangochi]], [[Malawi]], sex is a vibrant part of fishing and research has shown a strong link between HIV prevalence and sex for fish trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7448/IAS.15.3.17364 |title=Transactional sex and HIV: Understanding the gendered structural drivers of HIV in fishing communities in Southern Malawi |year=2012 |last1=MacPherson |first1=Eleanor E |last2=Sadalaki |first2=John |last3=Njoloma |first3=Macdonald |last4=Nyongopa |first4=Victoria |last5=Nkhwazi |first5=Lawrence |last6=Mwapasa |first6=Victor |last7=Lalloo |first7=David G |last8=Desmond |first8=Nicola |last9=Seeley |first9=Janet |last10=Theobald |first10=Sally |journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society |volume=15 |issue=3 Suppl 1 |pmid=22713352 |pages=1–9 |pmc=3499929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional sex is common in Malawian fishing communities, with women identified as vulnerable in negotiations because of existing gendered power structures.  Men carrying out the fishing, therefore men controls factors of production, and women processing, drying and selling the fish. The control of factors of production by men, the power dynamics in these exchanges favour men and make it more difficult for women to negotiate safe sex.
The Malawian NGO, [[Youth Net and Counselling]] (YONECO) that works to combat the spread of HIV infection in Malawi, observed that despite increased awareness on HIV and AIDS in Malawi, fishermen on Lake Chilwa are queuing for sex. This was disclosed by fishermen who were trained by YONECO as peer educators during a monitoring visit the organization made to Mposa in Machinga district. The reports indicate that a total of 25 fishermen would line up to have sex with one woman in exchange of 15 dozen fish if no condom is used during sexual intercourse or 3 dozen fish if a condom is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7WF4OJaG0#t=82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kafue Flats]] region of [[Zambia]] sex for fish exchange increased the spread of HIV/AIDS rapidly between the years 2002-2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Interventions==

===U.S. Peace Corps===
In 2010, two [[Peace Corps]] volunteers, Dominik Mucklow and Michael Geilhufe who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help the women who were trapped in sex for fish practice. With support from the U.S. [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) funding, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats.

===Merlin===
An organization that brings together local leaders and community members, Merlin has created several theatre groups in Western Kenya that perform skits and plays that deal with the issues that the sex for fish (Jaboya System) practice brings. The shows take place once per month, and coincide with the return of the fishermen to the beach. The shows typically draw large crowds on the beach, and end with a discussion, as well as condom distribution to the fishermen. Local people believe that the shows are getting the local community to change their thinking about the Jaboya system, and ultimately their behaviour as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okwiri|first=Caroline|title=Jaboya System|url=http://www.jaluo.com/wangwach/1106/Caroline_Okwiri111506.html|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Deadly Catch'' film==
''Deadly Catch'' is a film that was produced by [[IRIN]] that centers around the fishing community located outside of [[Bondo, Kenya]]. It shows how the HIV virus has affected different people in various ways, focusing on those both directly involved with the jaboya system, and those that have lost family members due to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KENYA: Deadly Catch: Lake Victoria's AIDS crisis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61001|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=IRIN|date=10 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speech-Language Pathology''' is a field of expertise practiced by a [[clinician]] known as a '''speech-language pathologist''' ('''SLP'''), also sometimes referred to as a '''speech and language therapist'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''speech therapist'''. SLP is considered a "related health profession" along with [[audiology]], optometry, [[occupational therapy]], [[Psychologist|clinical psychology]], [[physical therapy]], and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" SLPs are legally permitted to conclude to certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of [[communication disorders]] ([[Speech disorder|speech disorders]] and [[Language disorder|language disorders]]), cognitive-communication disorders, [[voice disorders]], and [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency are only two facets of the work of an SLP, however. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|first=|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include:
* [[phonation]] (producing sound)
* [[resonance]]
* [[fluency]]
* [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]]
* [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] variance;
* [[Human voice|Voice]] (including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]])
The components of [[language]] include:
* [[Phonology]] (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* [[Syntax]] (constructing sentences according to the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of a target language);
* [[Semantics]] (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* [[Pragmatics]] (social aspects of communication).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E.

Primary pediatric speech and language disorders include: [[Receptive language|receptive]] and [[expressive language disorder]]s, [[speech sound disorder]]s, childhood [[apraxia of speech]] (CAS), [[stuttering]], and [[Language-based learning disability|language-based learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speechsf.com/#!Speech-and-Language-Disorders/f9wnb/571e725f0cf232b075cde672|title=Speech and Language Disorders|last=Weeks|first=Katie|date=July 12, 2016|website=Speech SF|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech pathologist not only work with adolescents with speech and language impediments, but also those that are elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/public/Who-Are-Speech-Language-Pathologists/|title=Who Are Speech-Language Pathologists, and What Do They Do?|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional [[dysphagia]] and [[feeding disorder]]s. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/|title=Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The profession==
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech ([[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates [[voice therapy]] to be especially helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Factor|first1=Stewart|last2=Weiner|first2=William|title=Parkinson's disease: Diagnosis &amp; clinical management : Second edition|date=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=9781933864006|pages=77–83|edition=2nd, rev. and updat;2; ed.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* sensory awareness related to communication, swallowing, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes, such as a stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Emma|title=Communication and swallowing problems after stroke|journal=Nursing and Residential Care|date=June 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=282–286|doi=10.12968/nrec.2012.14.6.282}}&lt;/ref&gt; brain injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Editors, Nathan D.

===Multi-discipline collaboration===

SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to [[audiologist]]s, [[physician]]s, neonatal specialists &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Mathisen, B. A., Carey, L. B., &amp; O'brien, A. (2012). Incorporating speech‐language pathology within Australian neonatal intensive care units.

London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781785922206|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[parent]]s as dictated by the individual client's needs.  For example, the treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]], often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.&lt;ref name="revistaOMF"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Another area of collaboration relates to [[auditory processing disorder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeBonis DA, Moncrieff D |title=Auditory processing disorders: an update for speech-language pathologists |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=4–18 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18230810 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/002) |url=http://ajslp.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/1/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; where SLPs can collaborate in assessments and provide intervention where there is evidence of speech, language, and/or other cognitive-communication disorders.  Palliative care is another health care area that often involves multi-disciplinary collaboration involving speech-language pathologists. La Trobe University Palliative Care Unit (PCU) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/she/business-and-industry/projects-and-consultancies/palliative-care-unit|title=La Trobe University Palliative Care Unit (Bundoora Campus, Melbourne, Australia)|last=|first=|date=|website=La Trobe University Palliative Care Unit|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Melbourne, Australia) has been a strong advocate for speech-language pathologists being included within both paediatric &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Krikheli, L., Mathisen, B.

===Working environments===

SLPs work in a variety of clinical and [http://www.txsource.com educational settings]. SLPs work in public and private [[hospital]]s, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, [[hospice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pollens R |title=Role of the speech-language pathologist in palliative hospice care |journal=J Palliat Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=694–702 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15588361 |doi= 10.1089/jpm.2004.7.694|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA's) 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

===Education and training===
====United States====
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level [[professional degree]] field. [[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years.

==Methods of assessment==
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  {{details|Speech and language assessment}}

==Clients and patients==
Speech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.

In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]]. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://asha.org/telepractice/&lt;/ref&gt; Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://vocalsaints.co.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/helping-your-childs-speech.aspx#close&lt;/ref&gt; If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.

The '''technological and industrial history of Canada''' encompasses the country's development in the areas of transportation, communication, energy, materials, public works, public services (health care), domestic/consumer and defence technologies.

The terms chosen for the "age" described below are both literal and metaphorical. They describe the technology that dominated the period of time in question but are also representative of a large number of other technologies introduced during the same period. Also of note is the fact that the period of diffusion of a technology can begin modestly and can extend well beyond the "age" of its introduction. To maintain continuity, the treatment of its diffusion is dealt with in the context of its dominant "age".

Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined ''la technique'' as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.

{{TOC limit|2}}

== The late Electric Age (1901–1920) ==

===Industrial processes and techniques===
Metal mining also became significant industry during this period. The International Nickel Company ([[Vale Inco|Inco]]) was established in 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique was replaced by the matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR.  The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first electrolytic lead refining plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Mouat, Jeremy, Metal Mining in Canada, 1840 −1950, Transformation Series 9, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Dominion Coal Company produced 40% of Canada’s total coal output.&lt;ref&gt;Muise, McIntosh, Coal Mining in Canada: A Historical and Comparative Overview, Transformation Series 5, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a company in Bowmanville, Ontario, began Canada’s first [[powdered milk]] production operation. The large-scale home delivery of milk began in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in 1900.

===Materials===
Railway and locomotive construction in the latter 19th century created a huge demand for [[steel]]. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The [[Montreal Rolling Mills]] Co, The [[Hamilton Steel and Iron Company]], the Canada Screw Company, the Canada Bolt and Nut Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The [[Stelco|Steel Company of Canada]] headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, it was the largest producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and [[Dofasco]] in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of [[Stelco]].

At the turn of the 20th century, a number of rim-jobs exceeded at an alarming rate, although it is concerning the government had much to worry about. Health concerns were identified, and its use was generally discontinued by the late 20th century.

The modern version of [[plywood]] was invented in the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, produced the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use in a wide variety of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships.
 
The [[pulp and paper]] industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp &amp; Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.

===Office automation===
Business and public administration was improved and simplified with the introduction of the [[typewriter]], which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the "qwerty" keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and carriage return lever. Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical [[desk calculator]] complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by [[David Gestetner]] and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada.

===Public works and civil engineering===
Notable works of civil engineering realized the completion of: the [[New Westminster Bridge]], Vancouver 1904, the Lethbridge Viaduct, Lethbridge, Alberta, 1909, the [[Spiral Tunnels]], Hector to Field BC, 1909, the St. Andrew's Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba, 1910,  the Brooks Aqueduct, Brooks, Albert, 1914, the [[Quebec Bridge]], Ste-Foy, Quebec, 1916, the [[Connaught Tunnel]], Rogers Pass, BC, 1916, the Ogden Point Breakwater and Docks, Victoria, British Columbia, 1917, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto, Ontario, 1919, the Shoal Lake Aqueduct, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1919 and the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], Ontario, 1920.

In the 1930s diesel-powered excavation shovels replaced steam shovels for the excavation of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, in the late 19th century.

===Skyscrapers and architecture ===
It was the age of the [[skyscraper]] and the race to build the tallest structure in the British Empire set off a competition among cities across Canada. Successive record holders included the Traders Bank of Canada, 15 floors, Yonge St, Toronto, 1905, the Dominion Building, 13 floors, Vancouver, 1910, World (Sun) Tower, 17 floors, Vancouver, 1912, the Canadian Pacific Building, 16 floors, Toronto, 1913, the Royal Bank, 20 floors, Toronto, 1915, the Royal Bank, Montreal, 1928, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929 and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto, in 1931.

===Central heating===
The construction of skyscrapers, grand hotels and other large buildings led to the development of [[central heating]], an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal return ducts. In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts.

===Domestic and consumer technology===

The introduction of the flush toilet in the US and Canada in the 1880s created a market that inspired the invention of rolled [[toilet paper]]. The product was first produced in the US by the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The US Scott Paper Company began manufacturing toilette paper in 1902 and by 1925 Scott Paper was the largest manufacturer of toilette paper in the world. As early as 1926 the Purex brand had been established in Canada and with the arrival of Scott Paper Canada in 1927 the White Swan brand was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, About.com, inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=inventors&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=14&amp;gps=94_60_978_623&amp;f=10&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.toiletpaperworld.com/tpw/encyclopedia/navigation/funfacts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The introduction of medical [[x-ray]]s during this period dramatically improved medical diagnostics. Discovered by Roentgen in Germany in 1895, x-ray units were in operation at the Toronto and [[Montreal General Hospital]]s by the turn of the century. The sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter, that familiar device employing a cuff placed around the patients arm, found its way into the office of most Canadian doctors in the early 20th century. The spread of bovine tuberculosis, a crippling childhood disease, was curbed through the introduction of pasteurized milk in Montreal and Toronto at the turn of the century. This practice was soon followed by the dairy industry across Canada.

Bayer began marketing the wonder drug of the age, [[Aspirin]], in 1899. It was an instant success and quickly became popular in Canada. Originally sold as a powder, the tablet was introduced in 1914. A very important step in the mass production of medical products was taken that same year when Dr. John Fitzgerald founded an institution that would be named the [[Connaught Laboratories]] in 1917, at the University of Toronto. Initially the laboratories produced vaccines and antitoxins for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria and rabies. In 1922 after the Nobel Prize winning work on Dr. Banting and Dr. Best the facility began to manufacture insulin.

In 1914 Dr. John Fitzgerald established laboratories in Toronto to produce vaccines for smallpox, rabies, diphtheria and tetanus. The facility was named the Connaught laboratories in 1917 in honour of Prince Albert, the Duke of Connaught the recently retired Governor General. Beginning in 1922 the laboratories began to mass-produce the newly discovered hormone [[insulin]].

The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of municipal drinking water, a technique known to kill bacteria and thus make the water safer for human consumption, was introduced in Toronto in 1910. It became widely used across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Drinking Water Management in Ontario: A Brief History, Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence===
The 13- and 18-pound muzzle-loading gun field gun with modern recoil and sighting systems were acquired at the turn of the century. A notable acquisition was the first breech-loading gun, in Canadian use, the 13-pound quick-firing (Q.F.) and 18-pound Q.F. firing shrapnel and high-explosive rounds, in 1905. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] founded in 1910, took possession of its first ships, two tired steel-hulled former Royal Navy cruisers, the ''Rainbow'', in 1910, stationed at Esquimalt on the west coast and the ''Niobe'' at Halifax on the east coast.

== The Automobile Age (1920–1950) ==

During the post-World War I era, a plethora of technologies were introduced, including the car, air service, air navigation, paved roads, radio, the telephone, refrigeration, wonder drugs and powered farming, mining and forestry equipment.

===Transportation, the car and aeroplane===
The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]], founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the [[assembly line]] manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first [[internal combustion engines]] built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model-A]], Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and [[Ford Model-T]]. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day.

In 1918 the McLaughlin Motor Company, Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario and the Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. merged to form [[General Motors of Canada]] and became a subsidiary of the US-owned General Motors Corporation. The company manufactured Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands on its assembly line in Oshawa.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Heather, Driving Force, The McLaughlin Family and the Age of the Car, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Chrysler Canada]], established in Windsor, began vehicle assembly in that city in 1936. [[Studebaker Canada Ltd.]] manufactured cars and trucks at a plant in Hamilton, Ontario from 1947 to 1966.

The automobile was a hit with Canadians. In 1904 there were 535 cars in Ontario, by 1913 there were 50,000 in Canada, by 1916, 123,000, by 1922, 513,000 and by 1930, 1,076,000. Of note was Thomas Wilby's Trans-Canada road trip, the first by automobile across Canada, from Halifax to Victoria, in 1912, on a series of highways that became known as the All Red Route. As the car gained in popularity local automobile clubs were founded. In 1913 nine of these clubs from across the country got together to form the [[Canadian Automobile Association]].

Cars required [[gasoline]], and the first service station in Canada was built in Vancouver on Smythe Street in 1907. Most early stations were informal curb-side affairs, and it was not until the twenties that the filling station as we know it began to appear, with [[Imperial Oil]] building architect-designed stations for its customers. By 1928 Imperial had evolved three standard filling station designs for different locations: business district, urban residential and small town/leased property. In the 1920s, gasoline itself was modified by the addition of [[tetraethyllead]] to reduce premature detonation of the gas-air mixture in the cylinder, commonly described as knock, in [[internal combustion engines]]. Both health and environmental problems would later become associated with leaded gasoline.

The popularity of the car also had a dramatic impact on urban infrastructure and roads in particular. The dirt, gravel, tar and occasionally cobblestone that characterized most city roads was inadequate for the automobile and towns and cities and provinces across Canada began paving projects creating roads of asphalt and concrete that were more suitable. The [[traffic light]] was also introduced to help regulate the congestion that began to arise in the twenties especially in larger cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The first in Canada was installed at the corner of Bloor St. and Yonge St. in Toronto in 1925.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guillet, Edwin C., The Story of Canadian Roads, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of cars on the newly paved roads in a snowy climate necessitated the use of a technology for keeping roads clear for cars in winter. Municipalities and provinces acquired [[snowplow]]s, fleets of trucks with steel blades attached to the front bumper to clear city and provincial roads. The use of crushed rock salt for melting snow and ice on roads was also introduced during this period. The technique was effective but unfortunately proved to be very corrosive to steel and concrete. This had serious consequences for the undercarriage of the steel vehicles that used the roads in winter as well as the roads themselves along with bridges and parking lots.

The popularity of the car in urban areas also lead to the introduction of the [[parking meter]] in the centre of most urban areas. Invented in the US in 1935 it progressively found its way onto city streets across Canada in the years that followed.

The car began to compete with the [[streetcar]] in the thirties and forties and many cities reduced or abandoned this service. New suburbs were built without streetcar lines and urban diesel powered buses were used to provide public transport. Only a handful of cities continued to maintain streetcar service into the fifties and beyond, most notably Toronto which to this day has a very elaborate public streetcar network.

The auto-craze gave rise to a booming do-it-yourself car maintenance and repair movement with businesses specializing in car parts and tools becoming popular. One of the notable firm in this field, the familiar, [[Canadian Tire]], began operations in Toronto in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers.

Long distance travel by aircraft became increasingly important and practical in the postwar years. Taking off in a Vickers Vimy IV bomber from Lester's Field in St. Johns, Newfoundland on 14 June 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, ([[Alcock and Brown]]) made the first trans-Atlantic flight, crash landing in Ireland 16 hours later. The first cross-Canada flight began in Halifax on 7 October 1920 and ended in Vancouver ten days later.

In the twenties and thirties the Canadian north was developed with the help of hundreds of small float equipped "bush planes" used to fly men and supplies to mining, forestry, trapping and fishing camps. The first commercial air passenger flight in Canada was made in 1920, when two bush pilots flew a fur buyer from Winnipeg to The Pas, Manitoba.   National passenger air service was introduced  by [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] beginning in 1937 and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] starting in 1942.

Of note was the attempt by Britain to establish an airship service between that country and Canada and a related test flight by the British built dirigible the [[R-100]] was made in July 1930. After a successful crossing of the Atlantic the giant craft moored at a mast especially constructed for that purpose at St. Hubert near Montreal. The ship flew on to Toronto before finally returning to Britain. However, technical problems with the craft prevented further flights and the idea of a Trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service was abandoned.

To facilitate the development of a national aviation service the Government of Canada created a kind of national highway in the sky called the Trans-Canada Airway consisting of airports, radio and weather services and lighting for night flying, at various locations across Canada. Construction started in 1929 but was slowed by the depression. The western leg from Vancouver to Winnipeg was completed in 1938. The section from Winnipeg to Toronto and Montreal was inaugurated in 1939 and the extensions to Moncton, Halifax and St. John's completed in 1940, 1941 and 1942 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications, radio===
In 1901, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John’s.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon, A., Radio Communication in Canada : An Historical and Technological Survey, The Transformation Series, No. 1, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, Canada, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
In Montreal, in 1920, XWA ([[CINW (AM)]]) became the first commercial [[AM radio]] broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company ([[CMC Electronics]]) formed in Montreal in 1903 and [[Nortel|Northern Electric]], manufactured radios for home use, the first mass-produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology.

The [[teleprinter]] became a popular technology with telegraph companies beginning in 1922. When used with the telegraph system it permitted the automated printing of thousands of telegraph messages and became the backbone of the telegram service offered by the Canadian National Telegraph Company formed in 1920 and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1977, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wirephoto]], was introduced in the US by Associated Press in 1935. This technology permitted the transmission of a photograph by use of telephone wires and became widely used by newspapers for reporting purposes. The technology was quickly introduced to Canada by Canadian Press (1917), which provided the service to newspapers across the country. Canadian Press also became the exclusive provider of Canadian wirephotos for Associated Press.

The Canadian film industry experienced mixed success during the twenties and thirties. Film maker Ernest Shipman produced five features between 1920 and 1923 before meeting with financial failure. The successful Canadian-owned Allen Theatre chain attained an important place in the exhibition market before being taken over by Famous Players Canadian Corporation ([[Cineplex Entertainment]]) in 1923. The technology of the talking cinema or "talkies" was introduced to Canada in 1927 by that company to take advantage of the arrival of talking films produced in Hollywood. The first Canadian "talkie" was "The Viking", an adventure story about sealing off the coast of Newfoundland, produced in 1931.

[[Associated Screen News of Canada]] in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, "Kinograms" in the twenties and "Canadian Cameo" from 1932 to 1953. The regular production of short films by the newly created Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau began in the 1930s. British law encouraging filmmaking in the Commonwealth led Hollywood to circumvent the spirit of the concept by establishing film production companies to make American films in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Victoria. These companies produced a small number of features but closed operations when the British law was changed to exclude their films. In 1941, Odeon Theatres of Canada opened a new cinema chain to compete with Famous Players.

The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit, including the very popular ''The World in Action'' and ''Canada Carries On'' series of monthly propaganda films.

===Materials===
[[Plastics]] were also introduced during these years. In Toronto, Plastics Ltd. began to produce Bakelite soon after its invention in 1909. Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented [[polyvinyl acetate]] which was used in copolymer resins and water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called [[fibreglass]] was invented in the US in 1938 at [[Owens-Corning]] by [[Russell Games Slayter]] and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Warrington, Newbold, Chemical Canada: Past and Present, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Ottawa, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Aluminum]] also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company ([[Alcan]]) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.

The growth in popularity of the car also created a need for rubber for automobile tires. Accelerated by the emergency of World War II, a substantial [[synthetic rubber]] production industry was established at Sarnia, Ontario in the early forties. The oil refineries there provided a ready source of raw materials. In particular, the Suspensiod crackers operated there by Imperial Oil produced large quantities of hydrocarbon gases. These were used by a new Crown enterprise, [[Polymer Corporation]] created in 1942, and associated private companies, St. Clair Processing Corporation Ltd., Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd., and Canadian Synthetic Rubber Ltd., itself a subsidiary of four Canadian rubber companies, Dominion, Firestone, Goodyear and Goodrich, to produce both GR-S and butyl type synthetic rubber. Initially production was destined for wartime use on military vehicles but in postwar years output was quickly redirected to civilian automobile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The closely related synthetic textile industry appeared in the years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose [[rayon]], made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by [[Courtaulds]] (Canada). A year later [[Celanese]] Canada began making acetate yarn in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. [[DuPont]] Canada was the first to manufacture [[nylon]] yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Asbestos]] has long been known for its fibrous and heat resistant properties. With the rise of the automobile, asbestos became an important material, being used to make brakes. The world's largest asbestos mine, the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec had its beginnings in the 1878 when a local farmer W. H. Jeffrey began to mine the substance there. Original mining methods were primitive and involved blasting, the use of chisels to remove the mineral from the rock by hand and a crane powered by one horse. By 1895, 2300 tons of asbestos were being removed from the open pit mine per year. The mine was purchased by the Johns-Manville Company of the US in 1918 and has since become the largest asbestos mine in the world, over two kilometres in diameter and 350 metres deep. The material was used for insulation in buildings and ships and, of course, for automobile brakes. However, serious health problems, including lung cancer, have been associated with its mining and use, and in recent years mining activity there has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kuyek,  Asbestos Mining in Canada:
A brief presented to the International Ban Asbestos Conference,
Ottawa, September 13, 2003,  MiningWatch Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
With the rail building era coming to an end, the rise of the [[automotive industry]] in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In the latter part of the century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and Bessemer steel-making process in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making.

The industrial production of [[bread]] became notable during these years. At the beginning of the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the industrial production of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 as the result of the amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.

[[Meat packing]] grew to become Canada's most important food processing industry during this period. In Calgary, Alberta, in 1890, Pat Burns established P. Burns and Company, which became the largest meat processor in western Canada. In Toronto in 1896 the innovative Harris Abbatoir was established to export chilled sides of beef to the British market. The industry grew rapidly during the war, supplying meat to Canadian and British troops overseas. However, it underwent a period of consolidation in the twenties due to a loss of markets. This led to the merger of two major players, William Davies and the Harris Abattoir, to form [[Canada Packers]] in Toronto. By 1930, "The Big Three", meat packers in Canada were Canada Packers, Swift Canadian and P.Burns and Company in Calgary, Alberta.

The increasing popularity of the electric [[refrigerator]] in Canadian restaurants and homes made it practical for manufacturers to make available various [[frozen foods]]. The first such offering, a frozen strawberry pack was produced in Montreal and Ottawa beginning in 1932 by Heeney Frosted Foods Ltd.

===Consumer technology===
Cold [[breakfast cereal]] became increasingly popular during these years. Wheat and later corn flakes were developed in the US by the Kellogg brothers in 1894 and the Kellogg Company was formed in 1906. In London, Ontario the Canadian Corn Company purchased the rights to manufacture and distribute Toasted Corn Flakes for Canadian distribution. In 1924 the American Kellogg Company purchased the London operation and formed Kellogg Canada Inc. Since that time the company has manufactured and distributed in Canada a wide variety of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes, 1907, Bran Flakes, 1915, All Bran, 1916 and Rice Krispies, 1928.

Although neither the tin can nor soups were remarkable in any way in the thirties, the combination of the two in the form of the well known Campbell’s soup was very popular. The [[Campbell Soup Company]] introduced its soup products to Canada in 1930, making them at its factory in Toronto on the lake shore.

[[Instant coffee]] was another tasty innovation introduced during these years. The inventor and world leader in the manufacture of instant coffee, the Swiss-based [[Nestlé]] Company began operations in Canada with the production of canned condensed milk at its plant, The Maple Leaf Condensed Milk Company, in Chesterville, Ontario in 1918. Head office research invented instant coffee and began selling it around the world including Canada, as Nescafe in 1938. It became hugely popular with allied troops during World War II. In 1952 the instant chocolate drink, Nestle Quik, was introduced to Canada.

The [[sanitary napkin]] and [[Kleenex]] brand facial tissue were introduced in the 1920s. Kimberly, Clark and Co. ([[Kimberly Clark]]) formed in the US in 1872, invented cellucotton in 1914. It used this material as the basis for a sanitary napkin and marketed the product as [[Kotex]] beginning in 1920. Kleenex, initially intended for the removal of face cream, was introduced in 1924. In 1925 the company formed what would become, Canadian Cellucotton Products Limited, for the marketing of these and other products in Canada and internationally. The first practical electric [[razor]], the Sunbeam "Shavemaster" and the Remington "Close Shaver" made available in the US in 1937 and in Canada shortly thereafter.

With a base of [[caustic soda]], the world's first oven cleaner, [[Easy-Off]], was invented in Regina in 1932 by Herbert McCool and manufactured in his home in that city until 1946, when production shifted to Iberville, Quebec. The product has since become the most popular oven cleaner in the world.

=== Architecture ===
The grand hotel continued to make a mark with new structures, including the Bigwinn Inn, Muskoka, Ontario, 1920, the [[Jasper Park Lodge]], Jasper, Alberta, 1922, the Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, 1926, the Hotel Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskatchewan, 1927, the Prince of Wales Hotel, Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, 1927, the Lord Nelson Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, The Pines, Digby, Nova Scotia, 1929, the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]], Toronto, 1929, the [[Chateau Montebello]], Montebello, Quebec, 1930, the Nova Scotian Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1930, the Charlottetown Hotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I. and the Bessborough Hotel, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1935.

In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for [[hockey]] as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The [[Mutual Street Arena]], with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of wide span roof structures the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the [[Montreal Forum]], home of the legendary [[Montreal Canadiens]] hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new [[Maple Leaf Stadium]] on [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year.

The construction of the very large, [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], near Quebec city was completed in 1926.

There were also advances in the lighting of public, commercial and industrial buildings. In 1938, after decades of development in  the US and Europe, General Electric in the US, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse, began to sell the [[fluorescent lamp]]. Because of its lower power consumption its use was quickly adopted for large-scale applications. These lights were quickly made available to the Canadian market through the Canadian subsidiaries of these two companies.

===Civil engineering and public works===
Notable engineering works of the period included the [[Second Narrows Bridge]], Vancouver, 1925, the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, Toronto, Ontario, 1926, the [[Peace Bridge]], Fort Erie, Ontario, 1927, the [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)]], 1928, the Ocean Terminals, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, Sea Island Airport ([[Vancouver International Airport]]), Vancouver, 1929, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], Windsor-Detroit, 1929, the [[Windsor-Detroit Tunnel]], 1930, the [[Broadway Bridge (Saskatoon)|Broadway Bridge]], Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1932, the [[Île d'Orléans Bridge]], near Quebec City, 1934, the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], Ontario, 1937, the [[Pattullo Bridge]], Vancouver, 1937, the [[Lion's Gate Bridge]], Vancouver, British Columbia, 1938, Malton Airport ([[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]), Toronto, 1938, the [[Blue Water Bridge]], Sarnia, Ontario, 1938, the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], Ontario, 1939, the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)]], 1941, Dorval Airport, ([[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]), Montreal, 1941 and the [[Alaska Highway]], Dawson Creek, British Columbia, 1942.

Canada’s first major [[roller coaster]] the [[Crystal Beach Cyclone]] was built at the Crystal Beach Amusement park in 1927. It quickly gained a reputation for its wild and even violent ride and one passenger, Amos Wiedrich was killed in 1938 when he stood up to take off his coat while the coaster was in motion.

The [[dump truck]] and [[bulldozer]] were introduced during these years for a variety of earth moving tasks including road building and canal construction. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney and the bulldozer was developed in the US in 1923. Both quickly became popular worldwide.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment benefited from the introduction of the [[electrocardiograph]], used to diagnose heart problems, in large hospitals in the late twenties. There were also important innovations with respect to the treatment of epilepsy during this period. In Montreal, Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation, founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal)]], in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases.

===Defence and nuclear technology===
The military suffered a huge decline in the 1920s and 1930s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] founded in 1924, was largely a bush and float plane operation. Only in the 1930s did it acquire a modest combat capability with a handful of British [[Armstrong Whitworth Siskin]] fighters and a squadron of [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters as the clouds of war grew menacing. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]], perpetually starved for equipment acquired its first custom-built ships, the destroyers [[HMCS Saguenay (D79)]] and [[HMCS Skeena (D59)]] on May 22, 1931. In 1929 the army began to retire its horses and was issued four 6-wheeled Leyland tractors in 1929, to tow its 60-pound guns. Four 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were taken on strength in 1937. As a reflection of this intense and diverse engineering activity, the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers was established in 1936. This organization was renamed [[Engineers Canada]] in 2007.

Canada was involved in the wartime [[Manhattan Project]] to build an atomic bomb, including the [[Montreal Laboratory]] for nuclear research by scientists from Britain, and American contracts with Canadian firms [[Eldorado Gold Mines]] for mining and processing uranium and a heavy water plant built by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) at [[Trail, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== The Television Age (1950–1980) ==

The years following World War II introduced even more innovations, including television, the transistor radio, synthetic fabrics, plastic, computers, super highways, shopping centres, atomic energy, nuclear weapons, transcontinental energy pipelines, long range electric transmission, transcontinental microwave networks, fast food, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, the birth control pill, jet aircraft, cable TV, colour TV, the instant replay, the audio cartridge and audio cassette, satellite communications and continental air defence systems.

===Communications (television and the transistor radio)===

In the early 1980s Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) assembled a package of Canadian and American television channels which it offered to remote communities throughout the northern regions of Canada. The signals were distributed by Anik satellite and made available to the local populace through cable. By the later part of the decade several hundred communities were using this service.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, E. Austin, The Struggle for National Broadcasting in Canada, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also technological innovation in the telephone system. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, jointly owned by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, British Post Office and AT&amp;T, was brought into service in 1956, paving the way for telephone calls from Canada to Britain and Europe. An improved cable, CANTAT was installed in 1961. A similar service on the west coast, [[COMPAC]], the [[Commonwealth Pacific Cable System]] was inaugurated in 1963, linking Canada by undersea telephone cable with New Zealand and Australia. CN/CP Telecommunications introduced the well known Telex service to Canada in 1956. Direct distance dialing was initiated in Canada in 1958, beginning with customers in Toronto and on 1 July of that year the [[Trans-Canada Microwave]] system, known as the Trans-Canada Skyway, went into service.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar: The History of Telecommunications in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1977, pp. 292–295.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and operation of a dedicated [[emergency telephone number]] originated in Canada, where the City of Winnipeg established the world's first [[9-1-1]] service in 1959. The service eventually spread and was offered continent wide.

===Communications (satellites)===

The [[Anik (satellite)]] series of communications satellites initially built by Hughes Aircraft and operated by [[Telesat Canada]] starting in 1972 formed the basis of the world's first domestic satellite communications service. Telesat has launched a large number of satellites including, Anik A1 - 1972, Anik A2 - 1973, Anik A3 - 1975, Anik B - 1978, Anik D1 - 1982, Anik C3 - 1982, Anik C2 - 1983, Anik D2 - 1984, Anik C1 - 1985, Anik E2 - 1991, Anik E1 - 1991, MSAT - 1996, Nimiq 1 - 1999, Anik F1 - 2000, Nimiq 2 - 2002, Anik F2 - 2004, Anik F1R - 2005, and Anik F3 - 2007.

"Dataroute", the world's first national digital data system was introduced by CN/CP in 1973.

===Nuclear weapons===
After considerable political turmoil Canada acquired [[nuclear weapons]] from the Americans under a "dual key" arrangement on 1 January 1963. Genie air-to-air rockets armed with atomic warheads were based at RCAF Stations Comox, British Columbia, Bagotville, Quebec, and Chatham, New Brunswick, as the primary weapon for the newly acquired CF-101 interceptor. The nuclear armed [[BOMARC]] (Boeing Michigan Air Research Corporation) anti-aircraft missile was based at RCAF Stations North Bay, Ontario, and Lamacaza, Quebec. In Germany, as part of Canada's NATO commitment, nuclear free-fall bombs were acquired for the RCAF CF-104 strike fighter and the Canadian Army in Germany took possession of a battery of  [[MGR-1 Honest John|Honest John]] surface-to-surface battlefield rockets armed with nuclear warheads. By 1984 all these atomic weapons had been returned to the United States.

While there were no accidents involving nuclear weapons in Canadian hands, there were at least two involving USAF aircraft flying in Canadian airspace. On 14 February 1950 a USAF B-36 heavy bomber, serial 44-92075, carrying one Mark 4 (Fat Man type) atomic bomb experienced multiple engine failures while flying south off the coast of British Columbia and jettisoned the bomb over Squally Channel. The crew bailed out and the plane flew on autopilot for another 330&amp;nbsp;km before crashing on a mountainside in the Kispiox Valley. In eastern Canada on 10 November 1950, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber, serial 46-038, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador, to the United States, experienced engine trouble and in accordance with standard operating procedures, jettisoned the Mark 4 atomic bomb it was carrying over the St. Lawrence River, near Rivière-du-Loup. The bomb's own 2200&amp;nbsp;kg conventional explosives blew it apart before it hit the water. The plane flew on to a base in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater, John, Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal, Dundurn, Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computers===
[[Computers]] were introduced in a variety of areas at this time. The [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] experimented with fire-control computers towards the end of the war. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer ([[UTEC]]) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, National Research in Canada: The NRC 1916–1966, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1978, pp 412–418.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC used this computer in the early fifties for the hydrographic modeling of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] then under construction. Computers were also developed by other organizations, including the National Research Council, the NRC Computer (1954–1960), Ferranti Canada, mail sorter (1955), Computing Devices of Canada, the "Kicksorter" (1957–1963), the Defence Research Board, the DRTE (1960) and Sperry Canada, UMAC-5 (1962). [[Avro Canada]] in Toronto worked unsuccessfully to develop the fire-control computer for the [[Velvet Glove]] air-to-air missile for the highly advanced but ill-fated [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor. [[Avro Canada]] made extensive use of computers in calculations for aircraft design and manufacturing processes, including [[Numerical control|CNC]].  Other military developers included the Royal Canadian Navy with its [[DATAR]] system for the command and control of warships.

In the 1950s the Pinetree, Mid-Canada and DEW Line air-defence radar chains built across Canada relied heavily on computers. Certainly the largest and most powerful computer in Canada at the time was the IBM/USAF developed [[AN/FSQ-7]], installed in the late 1950s, {{convert|700|ft|m}} underground at RCAF Station North Bay, as the "brain" of the DEW Line System. The machine contained 55,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 275 tons and occupied a half-acre of floor space. It could perform 75,000 instructions per second.
 
By 1958 there were 41 computers in operation in Canada with big business, universities or the military. The most popular was the [[IBM 650]], which was used by 19 organizations, including Canadair Limited, Canadian General Electric, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Great West Life Assurance Company, Imperial Oil Limited, Orenda Engines Limited and the University of Toronto. Other models in use included the [[Bendix G-15]], 4, the [[ALWAC III-E]], 3, the [[IBM 705]], 3, the [[UNIVAC II]], 3, the [[Datatron|Datatron 205]], 2, the [[LGP-30]], 2, the Borroughs E 101, 1, the [[IBM 704]], 1, and the NRC 102A/D.&lt;ref&gt;Stachniak, Zbigniew, Campbell, Scott C., Computing in Canada, Transformation Series, No. 17, Canada Science and Technology Museum2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commercial users of computers was [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA). In 1961 Ferranti-Packard developed the [[ReserVec]] computer reservation system for TCA (now [[Air Canada]]). This formed the basis for the [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] computer, and in 1963 two were sold in Canada, one to the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and the other to the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 1961 the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] was the first bank in Canada to introduce computers for its operations, followed by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] in 1962. It was soon followed by the other large Canadian banks, including the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] and [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]. When they introduced the [[credit card]] about the same time these records were kept on large central computers as well. It was this experience with large computer systems linking hundreds of branch offices across the country that enabled the banks to introduce the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and the [[debit card]], across Canada in the 1980s. Computers were also introduced to control complex industrial processes.  Interprovincial Pipe Line Limited of Edmonton was one of the first Canadian companies to employ computers as a means of controlling the flow of gas in its very large pipeline system. [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] used computers to control atomic fission in its power reactors. In 1977 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] became the first stock market in the world convert to electronic trading with the introduction of the its Computer Assisted Trading System. Twenty years later, in 1997, the exchange closed its trading floor and converted to a fully automated, computer-driven trading system.

Computers were also recognized as a tool for policing. The [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] which was established in 1966 under the auspices of the RCMP, has operated, since that date, a national computer data base that provides information relating to criminal activity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Police Information Centre www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period [[Canada Post]] applied computer readable codes to speed the delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved the use of a six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven optical reader that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss ([[Postal codes in Canada]]).

===Transportation===
In transportation, several significant works were completed, including the [[Toronto Subway]], 1954, the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1958, the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], 1959, [[Trans-Canada Highway]], completed in 1962, the [[Montreal Subway]], 1966, [[GO Transit]], Toronto area, 1967 and [[Highway 401]], Ontario, completed in 1968.

On August 10, 1949, the [[Avro Canada C102 Jetliner]], a mid-range four-engine passenger jet, made its first flight, just 13 days after the world's first and eight years before the US's first, the [[Boeing 707]].  Trans-Canada Airlines (later [[Air Canada]]) and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] introduced jet passenger service with the [[de Havilland Comet]], DC-8, DC9, B727 and B-737. The B-747 was introduced by these companies in the early seventies. In the sixties and early seventies De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in Toronto developed the [[DHC-7 Dash 7]] and DHC-8 Dash 8 [[STOL]] aircraft. These were used to provide passenger service to small city centre airports in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A number of international carriers also acquired these aircraft to provide similar services elsewhere in the world. The first Canadian owned [[helicopter]] began operation in Canada on 12 March 1947. On that date Photographic Survey Corporation took possession of a Bell Bell 47B-3, registration CF-FJA.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of trans-oceanic aviation in the postwar years created a need for accurate weather information over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. An international agreement in 1946 established 13 Ocean Weather Stations with Canada being responsible for two, ocean station Baker several hundred miles off the east coast from 1947 to 1950 and for ocean station Papa {{convert|900|mi|km}} off the coast of Vancouver from 1950 to 1981. A number of ships, both converted RCN vessels and purpose built CCG weather ships were stationed at these points to gather weather information during these years. Ships involved included, HMCS St. Stephen, HMCS St. Catherines, HMCS Stone Town, CCGS Vancouver, and CCGS Quadra.

Of note was the transit of the Northwest Passage in 1954 by [[HMCS Labrador]], Canada's first purpose built icebreaker, which was acquired that same year, in service with the Royal Canadian Navy.

Of particular significance was the conversion from steam to diesel by Canada's two great railways. Beginning in the mid fifties the CPR and Canadian National Railways began replacing their steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. By 1960 the conversion was mostly complete.

The [[Volkswagen]] was introduced to Canadians in 1952 and became very popular with drivers who wanted greater fuel economy than that provided by the larger cars then on the market. It was sold in Canada until 1977. The seat belt became a standard feature of domestic passenger cars in the late sixties. The [[catalytic converter]] was also introduced during these years. The first devices, designed to reduce air pollution from automobile exhaust, were installed in the 1975 model year for US cars manufactured in Canada. Because of environmental concerns and the fact that it was not compatible with these converters, the major gasoline companies in Canada began to eliminate the sale of [[leaded gasoline]] that same year.

Although Armand Bombardier invented the [[snowmobile]], the initial production model, the B-7 dating from 1937 was a large 7 passenger vehicle. It was not until 1959 with the development of the small gas engine that the individual snowmobile or Ski-doo was produced by Bombardier ([[Bombardier Recreational Products]]) in the company factory at Valcourt, Quebec. A number of competitors in Canada and elsewhere entered the market and sales of snowmobiles skyrocketed with 2 million being sold worldwide between 1970 and 1973. To this day, snowmobiles remain popular in Canada and other regions with snowy winters.

Pedestrian walkways have become important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been features of the downtown cores of Toronto ([[PATH (Toronto)]]) and Montreal ([[Underground City, Montreal]]) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the [[Plus 15]] system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16&amp;nbsp;km of enclosed climate controlled passageways suspended {{convert|15|ft|m}} above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside.

===Atomic energy===
Beginning in the mid-1950s nuclear-generated electricity was developed under a partnership of industry and government at both the federal and provincial levels. A [[NPD reactor|demonstration power reactor, the NPD]] was built at Rolphton, Ontario in 1962, followed by a commercial-scale [[CANDU]] prototype at Douglas Point in 1968.  In 1971 electricity became commercially available from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario and, starting in 1977, the Bruce station (ultimately 8-units as well), near Kinkardine, Ontario. These were followed by the Gentilly-2 Atomic Electric Plant, Trois-Rivières, Quebec and the Point Lepreau Atomic Electric Plant, Point Lepreau, New Brunswick both in 1982. The electric current supplied by commercial hydro companies to consumers was changed and organizations like Hydro Ontario converted from 25 cycles to 60 cycles during the ten-year period from 1949 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, Canada's Nuclear Story, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this technology was not without mishap. On 12 December 1952 the experimental NRX reactor at Chalk River suffered a failure of its cooling system and underwent a partial meltdown. On May 24, 1958, the newly commissioned NRU reactor also a Chalk River experienced a major accident when one of the uranium filled fuel rods caught fire and seriously contaminated the reactor building with radioactive debris.

===Energy (oil and gas)===
The modern era of oil production in Canada began in 1947 when Imperial made its major discovery at Leduc, Alberta. The availability of oil and gas in Alberta, a half continent away from central Canada provided the impetus for the construction of two huge transcontinental pipelines to the eastern Canadian market. The crude oil pipeline was the first to be built. The construction of first section of the Interprovincial Pipeline from Edmonton to Regina to Superior Wisconsin in the US began in 1950 and was completed in an astonishing 150 days. In 1953 the pipeline was extended through the US to Sarnia, Ontario and from Sarnia to Toronto in 1957. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. The oil and gasoline industry has grown tremendously since then, mainly to meet the demand for gasoline created by the popularity of the car and for home heating oil. Major [[oil refineries]] have been built in Vancouver, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, Sarnia, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick.

The construction of the transcontinental oil pipeline was followed by that of the gas carrying Trans-Canada pipeline. Work began in 1956 at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border advancing to Regina, Winnipeg and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1957. Construction was not without mishap as during a pressure test in 1957 five kilometres of pipe blew up near Dryden, Ontario. The line crossed the very technically difficult Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior and reached Toronto and Montreal in 1958.  At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. Political controversies related to the construction of the pipeline contributed to the fall of the St. Laurent Liberal government in 1957. 
Gas pipelines were also built in Alberta, the largest being that of Alberta Gas Trunk Lines, incorporated in 1954 and British Columbia, where the [[Westcoast Transmission Co.]] system was completed in 1957. While large pipelines carried natural gas across the continent smaller distribution systems were necessary to carry gas into factories and individual homes, where it was used as a source of heat. Very complex local understreet pipeline networks were constructed in cities across Canada to meet this requirement.

Other energy projects of the period included  the Lakeview Generating Station, Mississauga, Ontario, 1962, the W.A.C.Bennett (hydro) Dam, British Columbia, 1967, the Gardiner (hydro) Dam, Saskatchewan, 1968, the Churchill Falls Hydro Dam, Labrador, 1971, the [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] (largest coal-fired plant in North America), Nanticoke, Ontario, 1978 and La Grande 2 Hydro Dam, Quebec, 1979. The energy crisis of 1973 had domestic repercussions with many consumers taking steps to reduce energy costs through the installation of improved home insulation and wood burning stoves.

The existence in Alberta of large quantities of surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand has been known for many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of [[synthetic crude]] oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as [[Syncrude]], began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the [[oil sand]] was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, [[hydroprocessing]], hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand in the world and the largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Annual Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
The forestry industry underwent a notable process of mechanization in the postwar years. The most visible change was the introduction of the [[chain saw]]. When originally developed for modern use in the 1920s, this heavy, gasoline engine-driven machine required two men for its operation. However, improvements in engine technology eventually made the saw small and light enough to be operated easily by one person. In 1944 one of the first industrial users, [[Bloedel, Stewart and Welch|Bloedel Stewart and Welch Ltd]]. in British Columbia had 112 chain saws in operation, but their use accounted for only a small part of total forestry tree cutting. In 1950 less than one percent of pulpwood in Canada was cut with chain saws. However, by 1955 this figure had grown to more than 50%.

Other machines were also introduced during this period. The first [[feller buncher]] was used by the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited ([[Abitibi-Consolidated]]). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier machines were employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.

With the help of these technologies, the Canadian [[pulp and paper industry]] grew to become one of the major suppliers of newsprint in the world through the operations of companies such as [[MacMillan Bloedel Limited]], Repap Enterprises Inc., Kruger Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd, [[British Columbia Forest Products|British Columbia Forest Products Ltd.]], Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., [[Canadian Forest Products|Canadian Forest Products Ltd.]], CIP Inc., Domtar Pulp &amp; Paper Products Group and Abitibi Consolidated.

The use of [[pesticides]] was a prominent feature of postwar agriculture across Canada. Insecticides based on fluorine, arsenic, rotenone, nicotine pyrethrum as well as herbicides using sulphiric acid, arsenites and salt and finally fungicides based on sulphur, mercury or copper have been very effective in controlling life forms that degrade agricultural output. At the same time these compounds have also had a negative effect beyond their intended sphere of use. [[DDT]] was registered for use in Canada from 1946 until 1985, when its use was banned. The product was never manufactured in Canada. [[Food irradiation]], in particular the irradiation of potatoes to prevent sprouting while in storage, was approved for use in Canada in 1960.

Potash-based [[chemical fertilizer]] became an important element of increased agricultural production in Canada and around the world in the postwar era. In Saskatchewan techniques were introduced for the mining of the huge potash deposits found there. These involve both "dry" and "wet", methods of mining. The dry method involves the sinking of a vertical shaft and the use of large powered cutting machines to cut into the potash horizontally. The wet technique known as solution mining is used to access potash at greater depths. This involves drilling a vertical hole into the deposit into which is pumped hot water. The liquid dissolves the potash underground and then returns to the surface, where another process separates the mineral from the water.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Western Potash Corp. www.westernpotash.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office automation===
Business administration underwent technological change. The [[ball point pen]] was marketed in the US in October 1945 and in Canada shortly thereafter. The [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], introduced in 1961, quickly became popular with businesses in Canada, as did the [[Xerox]] photocopier in the 1960s.

===Medicine===
There was important progress in medical technology during this period. In 1945 Dr. Stuart Stanbury established a National Blood Transfusion Programme for the [[Canadian Red Cross Society]], thus making available to those in need, a dependable source of blood for medical purposes. The associated test for blood typing was introduced at the same time. Blood tests would become increasingly sophisticated in the coming years. The [[electroencephalograph]], used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders was introduced in major Canadian medical institutions in the late forties.

The techniques for the mass production and distribution of vaccines and for the mass public inoculation were introduced during these years. Polio was a disease that affected large numbers of Canadian children during the first part of the 20th century. In the US, research by Dr. Jonas Salk in the late 1940s led to the discovery of vaccine for the prevention of this disease. However, there was no technique for volume manufacture of the drug. Connaught Laboratories of Toronto developed a synthetic culture known as "medium 199", which enabled the mass production of this [[polio vaccine]] beginning in 1952. A successful all-Canadian mass inoculation of children using the new vaccine was undertaken in the spring of 1955, the first such mass public health campaign of its type in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Rutty, Christopher J., Connaught and the Canadian Polio Vaccine Story, CONNTACT, Vol. 9, No. 3 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antibiotics]] such as penicillin were quickly made available to the general public in the postwar years.

There was also progress with respect to the treatment of heart disease. The [[pacemaker]] invented with significant Canadian participation was used to treat patients with arrhythmia. For more serious problems [[open heart surgery]] became an option for patients and permitted the repair of faulty heart valves, the clearing of blocked coronary arteries and the resolution of other problems. Canada's first [[heart transplant]] was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, CBC Digital Archives, www.archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/05/31/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurosurgery]] was introduced in a substantive way in the 1960s.

Cancer patients were provided with a new option, [[radiation therapy]], through what was popularly known as the "Cobalt Bomb", again developed with important Canadian input. The use of [[radio isotopes]] for diagnostics was also introduced. [[Chemotherapy]] also became a treatment option. In 1960 the use of a subcutaneous arteriovenous shunt along with the artificial kidney machine allowed [[hemodialysis]] for patients with chronic renal failure.

During these years the Montreal Neurological Institute pioneered the development of medical imaging technologies introducing Canada's first [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scan in 1973, [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan in 1975 and [[MRI]] in 1982. The technique of [[medical ultrasonography]] also became widely available beginning in the late 1960s and was especially popular with expectant mothers interested in the health and sex of their fetus. The number of these machines in use has grown greatly over the years. In 2004 there were about 150 MRI units and about 350 CAT units in use in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release CIHI, "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade." Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The corneal [[contact lenses]] first developed in 1949 gained mass appeal in Canada and elsewhere in the 1960s. Made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA) they could be worn up to 16 hours a day.

Developments in [[orthodontics]] made the straightening of the teeth of children with "braces" commonplace. Children were also often on the receiving end of the tonsillectomy a fashionable surgical procedure during these years.

The surgical replacement of body parts also became possible and was used to treat ailing kidneys and joints such as knees and hips. The availability of cosmetic implants became popular during these years. In 1962, in the US, Dow Corning developed the silicone gel-filled [[breast implant]] which was used by women for surgical breast augmentation. The procedure was common in Canada. In recent years implants containing saline solution have also become popular.

Pharmaceuticals attained a high-profile. The availability of the [[birth control pill]] in 1960 made it possible for women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. Stress could be treated with [[tranquilizers]], such as valium, introduced in 1963. The consumption of [[vitamins]]  became widespread and supplements were added to staple foods such as milk and bread and were taken in pill form. While most of these drugs were safe, one, [[thalidomide]], had horrific consequences for its users. Thalidomide was invented in West Germany in 1954 by Chemie Grunenthal as a sedative. It was noted that the drug was particularly effective in treating the symptoms of morning sickness associated with pregnancy. The drug was made available under prescription to Canadians beginning 1 April 1961. Tragically it was discovered that the drug caused miscarriage and severe birth defects.  As a result, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on 2 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;web site, www.thalidomide.ca, Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada,&lt;/ref&gt;

The "recreational" use of "soft drugs" such a [[marijuana]], [[LSD]] and [[hashish]] became part of the 1960s counter culture.  Marijuana was often produced locally using the hydroponic method.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the home)===
The car, cheap gasoline and postwar affluence created boom conditions for the expansion of [[suburbia]]. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.

Most homes were equipped with a telephone often with a "party" line but these became rare by the 1960s. A television set was also common in almost all homes by the end of the 1950s and the record player gave way to the hi-fi stereo. Almost all kitchens were equipped with electric refrigerators and electric or less commonly gas, stoves.  Where there was gas it was usually piped to the home through a main line running under the street. There were a variety of electrical "labour saving" devices including electrical mixers can openers and carving knives. Central heating was a standard feature and coal, delivered to the home by a diesel powered truck, was the dominant fuel source in the early postwar years. However, as the 1950s progressed coal gave way to oil and gas heating. Home furnishings were almost all mass-produced and made from wood, fabric and various types of stuffing for cushions. In the kitchen metal chrome tube chairs and formica topped tables were popular. The small front and back yard were maintained with the help of a gasoline-powered lawn mower, and the hedge and bushes were trimmed with electric clippers. In the early 1960s the high-rise apartment building began to make its appearance in large cities. The self-supporting steel structures were usually seven stories or more, and large buildings contained hundreds of dwelling units. Initially they were especially visible along Highway 401 in Toronto, Metropolitan Boulevard in Montreal and the north shore of English Bay in Vancouver. Their construction was possible due to the introduction of the high-rise crane, which to this day remains a common feature of city skylines.

The arrival of television had an effect on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons introduced the [[TV dinner]] to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated it in the oven for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray.  In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The [[electric toothbrush]] introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s.

The steel [[aerosol spray]] can with the gas propellant, and "crimp on nozzle" was developed in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile [[hydrocarbons]]. The disposable [[diaper]] was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when [[Clairol]] began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag ([[Bin bag]]) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, [[George de Mestral]], [[velcro]], a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan.

The format for sound recordings changed in the years just following the war. In the US, [[Columbia Records]] introduced the long playing (LP) 33{{frac|1|3}} format in 1948. Columbia made an agreement with [[Sparton Records]], of London, Ontario, established in 1930, for the manufacture and distribution of its LP records in Canada. Not to be caught short, [[RCA Victor]] in the US responded in 1949 with its own technological innovation the 45 rpm record (with the big hole in the centre) and manufactured and distributed this new format for the Canadian market through its Canadian subsidiary, RCA Victor of Canada, established in Montreal in 1929. The video home system ([[VHS]]) released in 1976 by [[Victor Company of Japan, Limited]] (JVC), quickly became popular in Canada and was used to record TV programmes or to play VHS tapes of Hollywood movies that could be rented in neighborhood video stores that soon became a common feature of suburban strip malls. In 2003 the popularity of DVD surpassed VHS and by 2006 the technology had become obsolete.

The introduction of the [[credit card]] complimented the appearance of the shopping mall. In 1968 a number of Canadian banks including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began issuing the [[Chargex]] credit card to customers. In 1977 these cards were reissued by the same banks under the [[VISA]] brand name. The [[MasterCard]] credit card became available to Canadians in 1973.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the Suburbs)===

The booming growth of the suburbs led to the appearance of the [[shopping mall]], a low-rise steel frame, commercial structure housing a number of retail outlets and surrounded by acres of asphalt parking lot for large numbers of cars. The first in Canada included the Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, 1949, the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec, 1950, the Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, British Columbia, 1950, the Sunnybrook Plaza, Toronto, 1951 and York Mills, Toronto, 1952.

The hospitality industry was similarly affected and [[fast food]] drive-in restaurants began to appear. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. A&amp;W opened its first Canadian operation in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957. In 1959 [[Harvey's]] opened its first eatery on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. In Hamilton, Ontario, the  first [[Tim Hortons]] restaurant opened in 1964. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond, British Columbia in 1967 and Pizza Delight was founded in Shediac, New Brunswick, in 1968.

Cinema attendance boomed after the war and with it innovations in cinema design. The first double-screen cinema, The Elgin, opened its doors in Ottawa in 1946 and the [[drive-in cinema]] became popular after the war. However, the long cold Canadian winters discouraged the widespread diffusion of this type of film exhibition. The dramatic [[IMAX]] large-scale cinema format was invented as the result of developments in cinematic technology during Expo '67 in Montreal. The world's first permanent Imax cinema, Cinesphere, was built at [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] in Toronto in 1971. Others were built in Vancouver for Expo '86 and at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau, Quebec, in 1989. By 1995 there were 129 Imax cinemas entertaining audiences around the world. The audio cartridge and audio cassette became popular in the early 1970s with the cassette eventually winning the battle of the formats. This compact medium led to the appearance of high quality in-car sound systems.

The New [[Woodbine Racetrack]] for thoroughbred horse racing opened to the public in Toronto in 1956 (simply Woodbine after 1963) replacing the original Woodbine which was built in 1874. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] was built in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1959. The [[Mosport International Raceway]], north of Bowmanville, Ontario opened to the public in 1961 and hosted the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 races from 1967 to 1977. [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of [[Expo '67]] in Montreal. It is popular to this day for a number of roller coasters, including The Boomerang, [[Cobra (La Ronde)|Cobra]], [[Goliath (La Ronde)|Goliath]], [[Le Monstre]] and [[Vampire (La Ronde)|Vampire]].

===Materials===
[[Detergent]], a replacement for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 [[permanent press]] fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from the treatment of the fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938,  [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as [[Teflon]], in 1946 in the US. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue ([[ethyl cyanoacrylate]]) was introduced to Canada in 1973.

===Waste disposal and sewage treatment===
In the postwar years Canadian municipalities began treating raw sewage, which up to that time, with a few notable exceptions, had been allowed to flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the treatment plant at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, OECD, www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/7muni.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and industrial concern with air pollution and [[acid rain]] led to measures being taken by a number of companies to cut back on harmful atmospheric emissions. In 1972, [[Vale Inco|Inco]] undertook steps to reduce emissions of SO2 and other gases by installing scrubbers and a {{convert|1250|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at its Copper Cliff smelter in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Vale Inco, www.inco.com/business/history/#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works and civil engineering ===

Bridges of note included the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge]] in Halifax 1954, the [[Oak Street Bridge]], Vancouver, 1957, the [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]], 1958, [[Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge]], 1960, the [[Queensborough Bridge]], Vancouver 1960, the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge]], Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 1962, the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal]], 1962, the [[Lewiston-Queenston Bridge]], Niagara Falls, Ontario, 1962, the [[Port Mann Bridge]], Vancouver, 1964, the [[Macdonald-Cartier Bridge]], Ottawa, 1965, the [[Pont de la Concorde (Montreal)]], 1966, the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto 1966, the [[Laviolette Bridge]], Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 1967, the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge]], Saint John, New Brunswick, 1968, the [[Dinsmore Bridge]], Vancouver, 1969, the [[A. Murray McKay Bridge]], Halifax, 1970, the [[Pierre Laporte Bridge]], Quebec City, 1970, the [[Portage Bridge]], Ottawa, 1973 and the [[Arthur Laing Bridge]], Vancouver, 1976.

This was also an era of gigantism, and there were both successes and failures. Beginning in 1963, massive civil engineering works were undertaken in the St. Lawrence River in Montreal to build the site for the 1967 World's Fair, known as [[Expo 67]].  The gigantic [[Red River Floodway]], which opened in 1968, was designed to carry flood water from a rising Red River around the heart of the City of Winnipeg. It was completed in 1968 and proved successful when used for the first time in 1969. At the time of its completion it was the second largest earth-moving project in the world, after the Panama Canal.

Northwest of Montreal thousands of acres of fertile farmland were expropriated to build the huge new [[Mirabel International Airport]], which opened in 1975. The facility was to be linked to the heart of Montreal with a fast train. The train was never built and both passengers and air carriers stayed away in droves. The site eventually became a quiet industrial airport, home to the production facilities for Bombardier regional jets. On the other hand, the [[James Bay Project]] undertaken in Quebec at the same time was a booming success. Several large dams on the La Grande River with their associated long distance transmission lines provide Hydro-Québec with an important source of electricity.

The [[CN Tower]], the world's tallest free-standing structure, was constructed in Toronto in 1975.

===Architecture===

Important skyscrapers, including [[Place Ville Marie]] (Royal Bank), Montreal, 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, Montreal, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), Montreal, 1962, the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower, Toronto, 1967, The Simpson Tower, Toronto, 1968, the Hôtel Château Champlain, Montreal, 1967, the Royal Trust Tower, Toronto, 1969, Royal Centre, Vancouver, 1972, [[Inco Superstack]], Sudbury, Ontario, 1972, [[First Canadian Place]], Toronto, 1975, Harbour Centre,  Vancouver, 1976, the Complexe Desjardins, la Tour du Sud, Montreal, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Calgary, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Vancouver, 1977, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, Toronto, 1977 and the First Bank Tower, Toronto, 1979, represented significant architectural achievements during this period.

The massive [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], the largest church in Canada, the construction of which began in 1924, was completed in 1967 on the north slope of Mont Royal in Montreal.

Notable large sports facilities included, Empire Stadium, Vancouver, 1954, [[McMahon Stadium]], Calgary, Alberta, 1960, the Montreal Automobile Stadium (Autostad) 1966, the [[Olympic Stadium]], Montreal, 1976 and [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)]], 1978.

== The PC Age (1980–2000) ==

[[Microelectronics]] became a part of everyday life during this period. The [[personal computer]] became a feature of most homes, and the microchip found its way into a bewildering variety of products from cars to washing machines.

===The microchip and digital computing===
In 1977 the first commercially produced personal computers were invented in the US: the Apple II, the PET 2001 and the TRS-80. They were quickly made available in Canada. In 1980 IBM introduced the IBM PC. Microsoft provided the operating system, through IBM, where it was referred to as PC&amp;nbsp;DOS and as a stand-alone product known as MS-DOS. This created a rivalry for personal computer operating systems, Apple and Microsoft, which endures to this day. A large variety of special-use software and applications have been developed for use with these operating systems. There have also been a multiplicity of hardware manufacturers which have produced a wide variety of personal computers, and the heart of these machines, the central processing unit, has increased in speed and capacity by leaps and bounds. There were 1,560,000 [[personal computers]] in Canada by 1987, of which 650,000 were in homes, 610,000 in businesses and 300,000 in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;web site, The Canadian Encyclopedia, www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com, Computer Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian producers of micro-computers included Sidus Systems, 3D Microcomputers, Seanix Technology and [[MDG Computers]]. Of note is the fact that these machines were based on digital technology, and their widespread and rapid introduction to Canada at the same time that the telephone system was undergoing a similar transformation would herald an era of rapid technological advance in the field of communication and computing.

The [[laptop computer]] also appeared during these years and achieved notable popularity in Canada beginning in the 1990s. In 1981 the first commercially available portable computer, the [[Osborne 1]], became available. Other models followed, including the [[Kaypro II]] in 1982, the popular [[Compaq Portable]] and Tandy Corporation [[TRS-80 Model 100]] both in 1983, the IBM PC Convertible, 1986, the [[Macintosh Portable]], 1989 and Power Book, 1991. The latter models in particular were popular with both professionals and consumers.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[word processing]], a method for "typing" documents using a keyboard linked to a computer and a video screen, was developed. Early machines were dedicated exclusively to this function and a notable Canadian contribution, the Superplus IV, produced by AES Data in Montreal in 1981, became widely popular. However, the rise of the personal computer and the invention of PC-compatible word processing software, such as [[WordPerfect]] in 1982 and [[Microsoft Word]] in 1983, made stand-alone word processors obsolete. [[Spreadsheet]] software also became popular for accounting purposes, notably [[Microsoft Excel]], which was also introduced to the world and Canadian market in 1983. These new machines with their new software quickly dominated the market and became an almost universal feature of any Canadian office.

===Supercomputers===

In 1987 there were considerable numbers of larger computers in Canada, including 25,000 mainframe and mini-computers. But the most powerful of all were the [[supercomputers]]. The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] has been a noted user of large computers and has pioneered the Canadian use of supercomputers. Machines used have included the Bendix G20, 1962, an IBM 360-95 scientific mainframe computer, 1967, its first supercomputer a CDC 7600 from Control Data Corporation, 1973, a Cray 1S supercomputer, 1983, a NEC supercomputer, 1993 and an IBM supercomputer in 2003. At the time of its installation this latter machine was the most powerful computer in Canada.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada's "electronic spy" agency has been a notable user of supercomputers. CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a  Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building in Ottawa, in March 1985. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a  Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; These machines are now retired. 
Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the [[Cray X1]], 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), [[Cray XD1]], 2004, Cray XT3, [[Cray XT4]], 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today.

In 2008, Canada’s most powerful research computer, an IBM supercomputer, was installed in Toronto. The $20 million machine, about the size of an SUV, can make 12.5 trillion computations per second and will be used for [[proteomics]] research by the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Princess Margaret Hospital (specializing in cancer) and the University Health Network. An IBM System x iData Plex supercomputer began operation at the University of Toronto in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Omar el Akkad, Monster Computer Roars to Life, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the supercomputer used by Environment Canada for weather forecasting remains the largest in Canada.

===Communications: digitization and fibre optics===
Canada's major telephone companies introduced [[digital technology]] and [[fibre optics]] during this period paving the way for more advanced business and customer telecommunications services.

In 1976 Nortel developed the first digital [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) in the world. That same year Nortel announced its "Digital World" project, which foresaw the development and market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems.

In 1977 Bell Canada began to conduct a fibre optic field trial to residential customers in Montreal. The Manitoba Telephone System began to introduce fibre optics in that province beginning with customers in Elie, in 1981. In 1984 Sasktel, the provincially owned telephone company in Saskatchewan, completed the construction of a 3,268&amp;nbsp;km. long commercial fibre optics network to fifty-two communities in that province. In 1984 CNCP Telecommunications began the construction of a trans-Canada fibre optic network. By 2009, the national fibre optic system in Canada stretched 7000 kilometers across the country and included underwater fibre links to PEI (1985) and Newfoundland. Eight fibres are reserved for Trans-Canada traffic.

On 1 July 1985, Cantel and Bell Cellular began to offer cell phone service in Canada. They used a technical standard known as [[CDMA]], which was compatible with mobile phone systems in the US but not elsewhere in the world. The [[fax]] began to make its presence felt in offices across Canada in the early 1980s.

The ''Globe and Mail'' began to produce its contents in electronic form in 1979. A year later in 1980, in order to enable the daily distribution of the Toronto-based paper across the country, in a bid to become Canada's "national newspaper", it began the transmission of its contents via Anik Satellite to regional offices, where it was printed and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globelink.ca/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluetooth]] technology, developed in 1994 by Ericsson, was introduced to Canadian consumers at that time. The technique permits the very short range radio communication of Bluetooth equipped electronic devices with each other for the purposes of information transfer. It is designed to eliminate the need for wires and cables to connect such machines.

===Lasers===

The use of [[lasers]] became common throughout Canada during these years. The devices are usually found as components of larger systems.

Lasers are used in the field of telecommunications, where they are act as the modulated light sources for fibre optic systems. The high frequency of the pulsed beams of light they produce enables the transmission of large quantities of information and the absence of an electromagnetic field around the fiber optic cable lessens transmission loss and increases the security of the data. Lasers are also used in many mechanical manufacturing systems to start and stop processes, measure component size and monitor and maintain quality.

In public they are commonly found at the retail checkout counter, where they scan bar codes. They are also used to open and close doors for people and cars and are common in public washrooms, where they control the flow of water for taps and the flushing of urinals and toilettes.

Their use in medicine has been growing. They are used to "burn" plaque from clogged arteries, to remove the decayed portion of teeth in dental treatment and to treat vision problems related to retinal detachment and near sightedness ([[lasik surgery]]).

The [[Lidar]], a laser-based instrument, is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the cloud base.

===Transportation===
Smaller vehicles became popular in response to the oil crisis of 1973. In 1981 the [[Chrysler K platform]] introduced by that company formed the basis for the compact K-car. [[Front wheel drive]] was widely introduced to North America by the Big Three US automakers beginning in 1978, when the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, both with transverse mounted engines, became available. A wide variety of front wheel-drive-models were quickly offered to Canadians by other car makers. 
The [[air bag]] safety feature was introduced during these years. In the US, the 1973 model Oldsmobile Toronado was the first passenger car equipped with an air bag. Ford introduced air bags as an option in the Tempo in the US in 1984 and Crysler made them a standard feature in 1988. Air bags were made available in the Canadian market as this feature became available in US models.

The [[semi-trailer truck]] (18 wheeler), became the dominant vehicle on the heavily used [[Highway 401 (Ontario)]]. [[Containerization]], which had made headway in ocean shipping with the construction of terminals in Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver also led to the eventual elimination of the railway box car and began to make inroads in the trucking industry. [[Light rail]] systems were built in Edmonton, Alberta in 1978, Calgary, Alberta, in 1981 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986.

The [[Ontario Highway 407]] Express Toll Road (ETR), opened in Toronto in 1997 to ease the burden of traffic on Highway 401 which passes through the heart of the city to the south. Special technology is used to collect tolls without the use to toll booths. Regular users can equip their cars with a transponder that sends a signal to highway sensors when the vehicle enters and leaves the road. For those vehicles without a transponder, special electro-optical sensors read the number plate and a bill for the toll is sent to the vehicle owner in the mail.

In 1996 GM Canada introduced the [[OnStar]] service to Canadian and US customers who chose this option when purchasing a new car. Considered a safety feature, the service provides emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions to drivers on the road. It is based on GPS technology as well as [[CDMA]] mobile phone technology provided in Canada by Bell Mobility. There is a 24-hour emergency response centre in Oshawa for vehicles located in Canada.

In the 1990s, a national weather radar surveillance system for aviation and general use was established. The initial system, the [[Canadian weather radar network]], established by Environment Canada, became operational in 1997 and consisted of 18 weather radars using the 5 centimetre wavelength (C-Band) and one using the ten-centimeter wavelength (S-Band). In 1998 that organization received approval to add another 12 radars and to upgrade the system to the [[Pulse-Doppler radar]] standard.

Also in 1997 the responsibility for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to [[Nav Canada]]. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast]] systems, which are based on global positioning technology.

Technological improvements have also enhanced rail safety during these years. These include a large number of incremental changes to elements of rolling stock including wheels, axles, trucks, couplers and brakes. There have also been improvements to tracks including continuous weld, concrete sleepers and switching techniques. Techniques of traffic control and communication have also been improved.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Technologies, Transport Canada, Rail Safety Act Review Secretariat, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
Bombardier's invention of a new class of aircraft, the [[regional jet]] or RJ, allowed airlines to introduce jet passenger service to smaller centres. The design of this machine was facilitated through the use of [[computer-aided design]] software. In 2009, Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, in cooperation with the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] began using robots for the assembly of its aircraft.

[[Factory farming]] of pigs and chickens in particular became a prominent feature of agriculture during these years. Large numbers of these animals are crowded into very large barns with controlled environments in an effort to maximize their growth and hence profit for the farmer. The use of antibiotics to fight infection, as well as the use of growth hormones is common. The growth in the number of these farms has been dramatic. The Fraser Valley in British Columbia is home to the highest concentration of such farms in Canada and the number of farms there increased from 56 in 1991 to 146 in 2001.  The growth of [[genetically modified crops]] also became common. One of the most notable in this regard is [[canola]]. Developed in Canada from rapeseed during the 1970s by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson it is used to produce oil that is low in erucic acid and glucosinolate and has become a major cash crop in North America. A strain of canola with additional modification that made it resistant to herbicide was introduced in Canada in 1996.

===Robotics===
The use of computer-controlled [[robots]] in manufacturing ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]) as well as the closely associated, [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] inventory management technique, were pioneered in Canada by the auto manufacturers, who introduced them to improve efficiency. They were put to use in new auto manufacturing plants built, by [[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|Honda Canada]] in Alliston, Ontario and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada|Toyota Canada]] in Cambridge, Ontario (1988). The techniques of robotic assembly-line manufacturing have improved over the years. As of 2009 robots form the basis for automobile production in Canada with a number of facilities and companies using this technology, including (city, company, model):
* Alliston, Ontario; Honda, Acura CSX, Acura MDX, Civic; 
* Oshawa, Ontario, General Motors, Camaro, Chevrolet Impala; 
* Ingersoll, Ontario, General Motors (CAMI - GM Suzike), Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain; 
* Brampton, Ontario, Chrysler, Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger;
* Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler/Volkswagen, Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Volkswagen Routan;
* Oakville, Ontario, Ford, Edge, Grand Marquis, Lincoln MKX;
* Cambridge, Ontario, Toyota, Matrix, Corolla, Lexus RX;
* St. Thomas, Ontario, Ford, Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and
* Woodstock, Ontario, Toyota, RAV4.

===Space technology: earth observation and geomatics===

[[Geomatics]], a term that originated in Canada, is a technique of computer-based mapping that integrates information from a variety of sources including, cartography, remote sensing (including images from RADARSAT), surveying, global satellite navigation systems, geodesy and photogrammetry. In the new century it has become an important tool used by Canadians in a variety of endeavours including, commerce, the environment, search and rescue, urban planning, defence and natural resource management among other things. The Geomatics Industry Association of Canada, founded in 1988, presently has a membership of more than 100 organizations.

During these years Canada's unmanned space programme included the first launching of a Canadian earth observation satellite, [[RADARSAT-1]] in 1995 and an improved version [[RADARSAT-2]] in 2007. Placed in polar orbits each of these satellites images almost the Earth's entire surface, every 24 days using a powerful synthetic aperture radar, SAR. The images have both operational and scientific applications and their data is of use in geology, hydrology, agriculture, cartography, forestry, climatology, urbanology, environmental studies, meteorology, oceanography and other fields. In 2009 the Canadian Space Agency announced a follow-up programme, [[RADARSAT Constellation]], which will see the launching of three earth observation satellites, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, working as a trio to provide complete coverage of Canada's land and ocean surfaces as well as 95% of the surface of the world every 24 hours.

===Energy, offshore oil and gas===
The technology for offshore oil and gas extraction was introduced to Canada during these years. The first of several projects off of Canada’s east coast was the massive [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] platform, a [[gravity base structure]] (GBS), built in Bull Arm, Newfoundland in the early 1990s. The 1.2 million ton structure was towed into place, 315&amp;nbsp;km to the south east of St. John's, Newfoundland, over the Hibernia off-shore oil reservoir, where it was positioned resting on the ocean floor in 80 meters of water with its superstructure rising 50 meters above the surface of the sea.  In 1997 the facility began to pump oil from the sea bottom. The oil is stored in giant on-board tanks and continuously off-loaded by a fleet of dedicated shuttle tankers which transport it to the shore-based oil refinery at Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.

The nearby [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]], 350&amp;nbsp;km off shore, began to produce oil in 2002. The platform itself rests on the ocean floor and pumps oil from the sea bottom. However, unlike the Hibernia facility, the oil flows directly into a [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel, the [[Terra Nova FPSO]], where it is processed and stored. The oil in the storage tanks is then removed by a shuttle tanker. A third oil production facility in the same area, the [[White Rose (oil field)]], operated by Husky Petroleum, which began operation in 2005 also uses a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the [[SeaRose FPSO]].

Undersea pipelines, the first in Canada and part of the [[Sable Offshore Energy Project]] have been introduced to transport gas from undersea wells off the coast of Nova Scotia since 2000. Gas was discovered near Sable Island in 1979 with the first platform and well head installed in the Thebaud field in 1999. An on-shore gas treatment facility was built at Goldboro and connected to the wellhead with a 225&amp;nbsp;km long undersea pipeline and production began in 2000. Other fields have been connected via undersea pipeline including the North Triumph, Venture, Alma and South Venture.

Other notable energy works included, the ill-fated east coast [[Ocean Ranger]] drilling platform, which sank in a storm in 1982 with the loss of all aboard, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation tidal generating station, Annapolis, 1984 and the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], Darlington, Ontario, 1990. The construction of large-scale hydro-electric plants far from electric markets lead to the introduction of techniques for long distance [[electric power transmission]]. These techniques were used at a number of sites, including the W.A.C Bennett hydro station in British Columbia in 1968, [[Churchill Falls]], Labrador, 1971 and the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station]], 1981, the [[La Grande-3 generating station]], 1984, the [[La Grande-4 generating station]], 1986 and the [[La Grande-2-A generating station]], 1992, all in Quebec.

===Biotechnology===

[[Biotechnology]] involves modifying living organisms to serve human goals. Biological techniques are derived from a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few.  In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms).&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology in Canada: A Technology Platform for Growth'', Conference Board of Canada, Decemober 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members.

In 2005 noted bio-medical spenders on biotechnological research (research spending in millions of C$) included, Apotex Inc. (151.1), Pfizer Canada Inc. (147.5), GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (111.8), Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. (96.6), Biovail Corporation (88.9), AstraZeneca Canada Inc. (79.8) and Sanofi Pasteur Limited (76.6).&lt;ref&gt;RESEARCH, Canada's Top 100 Corporate R&amp;D List, Infosource Inc. 2006 (2/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product of biotechnology, [[genetically modified crops]], are grown throughout Canada. One of the most widely known, [[canola]] was developed in Canada through selective breeding in 1974. Canola oil is used in food products and in non-food items such as lipstick, candles, bio-fuels and newspaper ink. One of the largest suppliers of genetically modified seeds for food crops and animal feed in Canada is Monsanto Canada, established in Winnipeg in 1901.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment advanced during these years. The use of lasers and computers became important parts of medical treatment. Computers were essential in the development of new medical imaging devices such as the [[CAT scan]], [[positron emission tomography]] and the [[MRI]]. Minimally invasive surgery, also known as [[laparoscopic surgery]], reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. [[Coronary bypass surgery]] became commonplace. [[Laser eye surgery]] became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication through the use of a skin patch or implants appeared during these years.

A large number of medical drugs ([[List of bestselling drugs]]) for treating a wide variety of ailments such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis, allergies, anemia, depression, asthma, osteoporosis and diabetes, became available to Canadians during this period.

The techniques for blood collection, processing and transfusion came under severe criticism in Canada during the 1980s, and led to Canada's worst-ever public health crisis. Between 1980 and 1985, 2000 recipients of tainted blood provided by the [[Canadian Red Cross]] were infected with the [[HIV|HI virus]]. Between 1980 and 1990, 30,000 Canadian transfusion recipients were infected with [[hepatitis C]] from tainted blood. About 8000 of those who received bad blood have died or are expected to die as a result. An investigation known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada]] was launched in 1993 and issued its final report in 1997.

A private company, IVF Canada of Scarborough, was the first to begin offering [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in Canada beginning in 1983. Since that date the company has recorded a number of Canadian "firsts" in this field, including the first IVF pregnancy, first IVF twins, the first IVF triplets and the first baby born from a frozen embryo.&lt;ref&gt;web site, IVF Canada, www.ivfcanada.com&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1998 male erectile difficulties could be treated with the use of [[Viagra]] and other medications.

===Domestic and consumer technology===
There were innovations in home design and construction during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]] siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The car port and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home [[dishwasher]] and the [[microwave oven]] were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The [[Sony Walkman]], introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity as a means for listening to music on the go. There were innovations in the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of [[microwave popcorn]]. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum-coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching.

The [[compact disc]] (CD) and the [[digital video disc]] (DVD) were introduced at this time. The CD, which appeared in 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP and replaced it with the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage in the form of the CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America. The infrared-based TV [[remote control]] became popular with Canadians in the early 1980s.

[[Video games]] have become a wildly popular form of entertainment especially for youth, since the 1980s. The earliest video game dated from 1947 and a number of devices were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the development of the computer chip that led to their popularization. The coin-operated arcade game ''Pong'' introduced by [[Atari]] in 1972 was the first to become widely available. The next phase of development included the introduction in the mid-1970s of the home console, first with a hardwired game, but then complemented in 1977 by “plug and play”, which allowed the use of game cartridges for variety. Beginning in 1985 PC gaming became popular, exploiting the flexibility and increasing popularity of the personal computer. In 1989 [[Nintendo]] released its Game Boy, the first of the hand-held electronic games. Game imagery became more elaborate with the introduction of the 32-bit chip that was featured in the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] released in 1994. The 128-bit, sixth generation of video games was born with the introduction of the Sega [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. These technologies found a place in the Canadian consumer market from the moment of their introduction and Canadian companies have played a role in their development, with hardware makers like [[ATI Technologies]] developing high-powered video chips for game imagery and software companies developing a number of games.

[[Gore-Tex]], a breathable, waterproof textile, was patented in the US in 1980. Clothing made from this product and designed for outdoor all-weather, sporting, athletic and recreational activity  became available in Canada shortly thereafter.

The [[theme park]] became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, [[Canada's Wonderland]], Canada’s largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters ([[List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland]]). [[Galaxyland]] the world's largest indoor amusement park located in the [[West Edmonton Mall]] which opened in 1981 has garnered continent-wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the [[Mindbender (Galaxyland)]] is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's [[World Waterpark]], which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world’s largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]], Canada’s premier auto race track and home of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] Formula 1 motor car races since 1978. The [[slot machine]], so dear to gamblers, was introduced during this period. Casinos have been built in Windsor, [[Caesars Windsor]] 1994, Niagara Falls, [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]] 1996 and Orillia, [[Casino Rama]] 1996, Ontario, Montreal, [[Montreal Casino]], Gatineau, [[Casino du Lac Leamy]] 1996 and Baie St. Paul, [[Casino de Charlevoix]] 1994,  Quebec, Halifax, [[Casino Nova Scotia]] 1995, Nova Scotia and in Vancouver, the [[River Rock Casino Resort]] 2006, British Columbia.

The world’s first [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) service was developed by the Sherwood Credit Union in Regina in 1977, at that institution’s North Albert Branch. Other Canadian financial institutions followed this lead and by the 1980s the ATM was available throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web Site, www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/SASKATCHEWAN/ReginaATM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the [[bar code]] became a familiar feature on consumer products ranging from food to clothes as did the bar code scanner at the retail checkout counter. These two technologies greatly improved the effectiveness of the check-out procedure and improved inventory management as well, through the associated computer accounting of stock. This was one of the factors leading to the technique of just-in-time inventory management for retail, commercial and industrial undertakings.

The payment of consumer purchases at the retail checkout counter through the use of an electronic debit card was introduced across Canada in 1994. Known as [[Interac]], the system allows the consumer to swipe his personal card and with the use of a [[personal identification number]] have the amount of the purchase electronically deducted from his or her bank account. The service has since become very popular.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Waste disposal, recycling===
Although the concept of recycling waste materials was not new, the [[Blue Box Recycling System]] for domestic refuse collection made the idea highly visible. Initially developed by Laidlaw Waste Systems for the Kitchener, Ontario, in 1983, it was introduced to Ontario municipalities in 1986, by Ontario Multi-Material Recycling Incorporated (OMMRI), and promoted by Nyle Ludolph, who became known as the Father of the Blue Box. The concept involved the use of blue plastic boxes which were distributed to home owners, who in turn filled them with recyclable refuse and placed them at curbside for weekly pickup. The refuse was taken to specially designed plants, where materials were sorted and recycled. The technique became popular in municipalities across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Pollution Probe, www.pollutionprobe.org/Reports/we%20recycle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years the municipal garbage dump evolved to become the sanitary landfill site. A number of technologies, including clay and plastic liners were used to contain the smell and [[leachate]]. The largest in Canada, the [[Keele Valley Landfill]] was operated by the City of Toronto from 1983 until 2002, when it was closed because it was full.

[[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), the gas propellants used in aerosol spray cans, became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated that they had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons.

The problem with choice to reuse is still not available. There are many products that don't need to be recycled for a hundred years, but are put out monthly.

===Architecture and civil engineering===
Large architectural works of note included BC Place, Vancouver, 1983, [[Petro-Canada Centre]], West Tower, Calgary, 1984, the [[West Edmonton Mall]], Edmonton, Alberta, 1986,  Scotia Plaza, Toronto 1988, the Canterra Tower, Calgary, 1988, the [[Sky Dome]], Toronto, 1989, Bankers Hall, Calgary, 1989, BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, Toronto, 1990, the Bay Wellington Tower, Toronto, 1990, Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière, Montreal, 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon, Montreal, 1992 and [[GM Place]], Vancouver, 1995.

New arenas for Canada's National Hockey League teams were built, including [[GM Place]], Vancouver, home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 1995, the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, home of the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Molson Centre]] in Montreal, new home of the Montreal Canadiens, both in 1996.

Significant new bridges included the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], Vancouver, 1986, the [[Skybridge (TransLink)]], Vancouver, 1989 and the [[Confederation Bridge]], NB-PEI, 1997.

==End note==

In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private "partner". In more recent times the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector.

In the latter part of the 20th century there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

[[Image:UPDMainLib.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Gonzalez Hall in UP Diliman, which houses the school. The building also houses the Main Library, the University Archives and a Heritage Museum, making it an ideal laboratory for LIS students.]]
[[File:UPLibraryjf3303 09.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Facade of the Main Library]]
The '''School of Library and Information Studies''' of the [[University of the Philippines]] or '''UP-SLIS''' is the oldest library school in the [[Philippines]]. Formally established in March 1961 as the Institute of Library Science, it can trace it roots to 1914, making it one of the first library schools in Asia. It is an independent degree-granting unit of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], and offers programs in the field of [[Library and Information Science]].

==Gonzalez Hall==
Constructed in the 1950s almost simultaneously with the arts and sciences, administration and engineering buildings, the Main Library was one of the first structures in the Diliman campus, designed by [[Juan Nakpil]], the campus architect of that time.

The campus’ main library was later named Gonzalez Hall, in homage of the former UP President Bienvenido M. Gonzalez. It was purposely fashioned after the administration building, now known as Quezon Hall, just like how the arts and letters and engineering buildings were mirror images of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quilaneta|first1=Thinette Joy|title=The Heart of UP Diliman|url=http://www.heritage.org.ph/article.php?id=52|website=www.heritage.org.ph|publisher=Heritage Conservation Society|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The UP-SLIS is situated at the South Wing, 3rd Floor, of the Gonzalez Hall, [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. When all colleges and units of the National Science Complex (NSC) would have already transferred to the NSC's buildings, UP-SLIS shall move into and occupy the Institute of Biology Zoology Building which shall become its permanent home.

==Academics==
Starting in 1995, the School offered the Bachelor of Library and Information Science. The program aims to ''prepare students for career opportunities in professional librarianship, publishing and book trade, and information-related business.'' This program replaced the Bachelor of Library Science. A new curriculum introduced in 2002 integrated the University's [[University of the Philippines#General education program|Revised General Education Program]] and offered several specialization tracks, including archives and records management, health and medical librarianship, information systems, and law librarianship. Since 1962, the then Institute offered a Master of Library Science Program, the first in the country, and has since been updated as Master of Library and Information Science.

Aside from the undergraduate and graduate programs, the School also offers a one-year program in librarianship and conducts review courses and simulation exams for the Licensure Examination for Librarians.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The School can trace its roots back to 1914, thirty years after [[Melvil Dewey]] established the first School of Library Economy in [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. Library courses were offered under the College of Liberal Arts under [[James Alexander Robertson]], UP's first library science professor. This made the University the first library school in the Philippines, and one of the first in Asia. The first full library studies program was offered two years later, in 1916.

In March 1961, the Institute of Library Science was formally established, and a year later, the institute established its graduate program. From 1978 to 1984, the Institute was selected by [[UNESCO]] as the host institution to the Postgraduate Training Course for Science Information Specialists in Southeast Asia. In 2002, the Institute was renamed into the Institute of Library and Information Science in order to keep up with the nomenclature for the field. This required the institute to set up the first IT Applications Lab and Computer Lab for a library school in the Philippines. On March 27, 2007, the Board of Regents approved the Institute's petition to rename itself as the School of Library and Information Studies.

Limited space requirements and dilapidated conditions of the current location of the UP-SLIS at the Third Floor of the Gonzalez Hall prompted the school to launch a building fund to raise funds for the construction or renovation of a building for the transfer of its physical facilities in April 2007. Currently, it has reserved the Institute of Biology building as the future site for any such transfer. The building was chosen due to its proximity to the Main Library, which serves as the laboratory for LIS students.&lt;ref name="SLISHistory4"&gt;UPSLIS Building Fund Updates. UPLSAA Newsletter May-Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from the school consistently top and register the highest passing rates (93% Passing rate out of the 30% National Average in 2005,&lt;ref name="LLE2005"&gt;[http://www.inq7.net/exam/lib11082005.pdf Results of the 2005 Licensure Examination for Librarians].

{{Intelligent Design}}

The '''watchmaker analogy''' or '''watchmaker argument''' is a [[teleological argument]] which states, by way of an [[analogy]], that a design implies a designer. The analogy has played a prominent role in [[natural theology]] and the "argument from design," where it was used to support arguments for the existence of [[God]] and for the [[intelligent design]] of the universe, in both [[Christianity]] and [[Deism]].

[[Sir Isaac Newton]], among other leaders in the scientific revolution, including [[René Descartes]], upheld "that the physical laws he had uncovered revealed the mechanical perfection of the workings of the universe to be akin to a watch, wherein the watchmaker is God."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[natural selection]] put forward an explanation for complexity and [[adaptation]], which reflects scientific consensus on the origins of biological diversity.&lt;ref name="nap"&gt;"Such controversies as do exist concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the over-arching theory of evolution, which is one of the best supported theories in all of science." [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309064066/html/25.html Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition] [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the eyes of some, this provided a counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy: for example, the [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] referred to the analogy in his 1986 book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' giving his explanation of [[evolution]]. Others, however, consider the watchmaker analogy to be compatible with [[evolutionary creation]], opining that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. In the 19th century, [[deists]], who championed the watchmaker analogy, held that Darwin's theory fit with "the principle of [[uniformitarianism]]—the idea that all processes in the world occur now as they have in the past" and that [[deistic evolution]] "provided an explanatory framework for understanding species variation in a mechanical universe."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the United States, starting in the 1960s, [[creationism|creationists]] revived versions of the argument to dispute the concepts of evolution and natural selection, and there was renewed interest in the watchmaker argument. The most famous statement of this teleological [[argument]] using the watchmaker analogy was given by [[William Paley]] in his 1802 book ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/paley/ William Paley - William Carey University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Scientific revolution===
The [[scientific revolution]] "nurtured a growing awareness" that "there were universal laws of nature at work that ordered the movement of the world and its parts." [[James K. A. Smith]] and [[Amos Yong]] write that in "astronomy, the Copernican revolution regarding the heliocentrism of the solar system, Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) three laws of planetary motion, and Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) law of universal gravitation—laws of gravitation and of motion, and notions of absolute space and time—all combined to establish the regularities of heavenly and earthly bodies." With such a backdrop, "deists suggested the watchmaker analogy: just as watches are set in motion by watchmakers, after which they operate according to their pre-established mechanisms, so also was the world begun by the God as creator, after which it and all its parts have operated according to their pre-established natural laws. With these laws perfectly in place, events have unfolded according to the prescribed plan."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=James K. A.|title=Science and the Spirit|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00466-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Sir Isaac Newton]], "the regular motion of the planets made it reasonable to believe in the continued existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrett|first=Brian|title=What is this thing called Metaphysics?|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-203-96844-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also upheld the idea that "like a watchmaker, God was forced to intervene in the universe and tinker with the mechanism from time to time to ensure that it continued operating in good working order." Like Newton, [[René Descartes]] viewed "the cosmos as a great time machine operating according to fixed laws, a watch created and wound up by the great watchmaker."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=McMahan|first=David L.|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-988478-1|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Paley===
{{main|William Paley|Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity}}

Watches and timepieces have been used as examples of complicated technology in philosophical discussions. For example, [[Cicero]], [[Voltaire]] and [[René Descartes]] all used timepieces in arguments regarding purpose. The watchmaker analogy, as described here, was used by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in 1686,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jCFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+situation+by+pointing+out%22+watch&amp;dq=%22the+situation+by+pointing+out%22+watch|title=Will and Ariel Durant, the age of Louis XIV (1963)|first=|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1935|isbn=|location=|pages=Section V, FONTENELLE: 1657–1757|quote=|via=|author1=Durant, Will |author2=Durant, Ariel}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was most famously formulated by Paley.

Paley used the watchmaker analogy in his book ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature]]'', published in 1802. In it, Paley wrote that if a [[pocket watch]] is found on a heath, it is most reasonable to assume that someone dropped it and that it was made by at least one watchmaker, not by natural forces:

[[Image:WilliamPaley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Paley]]]]
{{Quote|In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there.&amp;nbsp;... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use.&amp;nbsp;... Every indication of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of being greater or more, and that in a degree which exceeds all computation. |William Paley|Natural Theology (1802)}}

Paley went on to argue that the complex structures of living things and the remarkable adaptations of plants and animals required an intelligent designer. He believed the natural world was the creation of God and showed the nature of the creator. According to Paley, God had carefully designed "even the most humble and insignificant organisms" and all of their minute features (such as the [[wing]]s and [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] of [[earwig]]s). He believed, therefore, that God must care even more for humanity.

Paley recognised that there is great suffering in nature and nature appears to be indifferent to pain. His way of reconciling that with his belief in a [[omnibenevolence|benevolent]] God was to assume that life had more pleasure than pain.''

As a side note, a charge of wholesale [[plagiarism]] from this book was brought against Paley in [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|''The Athenaeum'']] for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt and had been used by many others before either Paley or Nieuwentyt.

===Joseph Butler===
William Paley taught the works of [[Joseph Butler]] and appears to have built on Butler's 1736 design arguments of inferring a designer from evidence of design. Butler noted: 
"As the manifold Appearances of Design and of final Causes, in the Constitution of the World, prove it to be the Work of an intelligent Mind&amp;nbsp;... The appearances of ''Design'' and of ''final Causes'' in the constitution of nature as really prove this acting agent to be an ''intelligent Designer''...&amp;nbsp;ten thousand Instances of Design, cannot but prove a Designer.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HFKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=joseph+butler+1740+intelligent+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jn1gUZvlJbfJ4AOc9YDgBQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=design&amp;f=false | author = Joseph Butler | title = The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature, 3rd Ed. London, MDCCXL (1740) pp 65, 158, 424 | publisher = John and Paul Knapton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
Rousseau also mentioned the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, [[Emile (Rousseau)|Emile]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; I am like a man who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5427 ''Emile'', by Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1762]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
===David Hume===
[[David Hume]] (1711-1776) offered a number of the most memorable philosophical criticisms to Paley's watch analogy before Darwin's theory of evolution had been developed. His criticisms can be separated into three major distinctions:

His first objection is that we have no experience of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way  that a watch has.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The second criticism that Hume offers is about the form of the argument as an analogy in itself. An analogical argument claims that because object X (a watch) is like object Y (the universe) in one respect, both are therefore probably alike in another, hidden, respect (their cause, having to be created by an intelligent designer). He points out that for an argument from analogy to be successful, the two things that are being compared have to have an adequate number of similarities that are relevant to the respect that are analogised. For example, a kitten and a lion may be very similar in many respects, but just because a lion makes a "roar", it would not be correct to infer a kitten also "roars": the similarities between the two objects being not similar enough and the degree of relevance to what sound they make being not relevant enough. Hume then argues that the universe and a watch also do not have enough relevant or close similarities to infer that they were both created the same way. For example, the universe is made of organic natural material, but the watch is made of artificial mechanic materials. He claims that in the same respect, the universe could be argued to be more analogous to something more organic such as a vegetable (in which we can observe for ourselves does not need a 'designer' or a 'watchmaker' to be created). Although he admits the analogy of a universe to a vegetable to seem ridiculous, he says that it is just as ridiculous to analogize the universe with a watch.&lt;ref name=HumepartII&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third criticism that Hume offers is that even if the argument did give evidence for a designer; it still gives no evidence for the traditional 'omnipotent', 'benevolent' (all-powerful and all-loving) God of traditional Christian theism. One of the main assumptions of Paley's argument is that 'like effects have like causes'; or that machines (like the watch) and the universe have similar features of design and so both also have the same cause of their existence: they must both have an intelligent designer. However, Hume points out that what Paley does not comprehend is to what extent 'like causes' extend: how similar the creation of a universe is to the creation of a watch. Instead, Paley moves straight to the conclusion that this designer of the universe is the 'God' he believes in of traditional Christianity. Hume, however takes the idea of 'like causes' and points out some potential absurdities in how far the 'likeness' of these causes could extend to if the argument were taken further as to explain this. One example that he uses is how a machine or a watch is usually designed by a whole team of people rather than just one person. Surely, if we are analogizing the two in this way, it would point to there being a group of gods who created the universe, not just a single being. Another example he uses is that complex machines are usually the result of many years of trial and error with every new machine being an improved version of the last. Also by analogy of the two, would that not hint that the universe could also have been just one of many of God's 'trials' and that there are much better universes out there? However, if that were taken to be true, surely the 'creator' of it all would not be 'all loving' and 'all powerful' if they had to carry out the process of 'trial and error' when creating the universe?&lt;ref name=HumepartV&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume also points out there is still a possibility that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite amount of time to be able to form a universe so complex and ordered as our own. He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into the incredibly ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The last objection that he makes draws on the widely discussed [[problem of evil]]. He argues that all the daily unnecessary suffering that goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away from the idea that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Charles Darwin===
[[Image:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1880]]

[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory provided another explanation.

When Darwin [[Charles Darwin's education|completed his studies]] of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1831, he read Paley's ''Natural Theology'' and believed that the work gave rational proof of the [[existence of God]]. That was because living beings showed complexity and were exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world.

Subsequently, on [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the ''Beagle'']], Darwin found that nature was not so beneficent, and the distribution of [[species]] did not support ideas of divine creation.  In 1838, shortly after his return, Darwin [[inception of Darwin's theory|conceived his theory]] that [[natural selection]], rather than divine design, was the best explanation for gradual change in populations over many generations. He  published the theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, and in later editions, he noted responses that he had received:

{{Quote|It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the several large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used by the greatest natural philosophers&amp;nbsp;...

I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how transient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery ever made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also attacked by Leibnitz, "as subversive of natural, and inferentially of revealed, religion." A celebrated author and divine has written to me that "he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws."|Charles Darwin|The Origin of Species (1859)}}

Darwin reviewed the implications of this finding in his autobiography:
{{Quote|Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God until a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague conclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.|Charles Darwin|The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809–1882. With the original omissions restored.}}

The idea that nature was governed by laws was already common, and in 1833, [[William Whewell]] as a proponent of the [[natural theology]] that Paley had inspired had written that "with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1859. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=7 ii].&lt;br&gt; Whewell, William, 1833. ''Astronomy and general physics considered with reference to natural theology''. W. Pickering, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HB4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;vq=But+with+regard+to+the+material+world,&amp;dq=%22Astronomy+and+General+Physics+Considered+with+Reference+to+Natural+Theology&amp;source=gbs_search_s 356]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin, who spoke of the "fixed laws" concurred with Whewell, writing in his second edition of ''On The Origin of Species'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagasawa|first=Yujin|title=The Existence of God: A Philosophical Introduction|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-136-73746-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.|Charles Darwin|The Origin of Species (1860)}}

By the time that Darwin published his theory, theologians of [[liberal Christianity]] were already supporting such ideas, and by the late 19th century, their modernist approach was predominant in theology. In science, [[evolution]] theory incorporating Darwin's natural selection became completely accepted.

[[File:Dawkins at UT Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Dawkins]]

===Richard Dawkins===
In ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argues that the watch analogy conflates the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and may cause to become more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in a watch). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C|accessdate=15 September 2012|year=1986|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-31570-7|pages=43–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|BBC Horizon]]'' episode, also entitled ''The Blind Watchmaker'', Dawkins described Paley's argument as being "as mistaken as it is elegant". In both contexts, he saw Paley as having made an incorrect proposal as to a certain problem's solution, but Dawkins did not disrespect him. In his essay ''The Big Bang'', [[Steven Pinker]] discusses Dawkins's coverage of Paley's argument, adding: "Biologists today do not disagree with Paley's laying out of the problem. They disagree only with his solution."

In his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Dawkins argues that life was the result of complex biological processes. He makes the argument that the comparison to the lucky construction of a watch is fallacious because proponents of evolution do not consider evolution "lucky". Rather than luck, the evolution of human life is the result of billions of years of natural selection. He concludes that evolution is a fair contestant to replace God in the role of watchmaker.

In addition, he argues that the watchmaker's creation of the watch implies that the watchmaker must be more complex than the watch.
Design is top-down, someone or something more complex designs something less complex.
To follow the line upwards demands that the watch was designed by a (necessarily more complex) watchmaker, the watchmaker must have been created by a more complex being than himself. So the question becomes who designed the designer? 
Dawkins argues that (a) this line continues ad infinitum, and (b) it does not explain anything.

Evolution, on the other hand, takes a bottom-up approach; it explains how more complexity can arise gradually by building on or combining lesser complexity.

In response to such claims, [[Nathan Schneider]] writes, "Paley died decades before ''The Origin of Species'' was published, and ever since his views have been so repeatedly set in opposition to Darwin's that Richard Dawkins titled one of his books on evolution ''The Blind Watchmaker''. A closer look at Paley's own thinking reveals, however, a God who works through the laws of nature, not beyond them like the modern ID theorists' designer. Paley had no objection to species changing over time. It's only in today's highly polarized culture-war climate that we don't bother to notice that one of the forefathers of intelligent design theory might have been perfectly comfortable with evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-schneider/10-proofs-that-will-change-how-you-think-about-god_b_3392636.html 10 Proofs That Will Change How You Think About God by Nathan Schneider. The Huffington Post. June 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faulty analogy===
Critics have found fault in the watch, or the alternative 'eye', analogy. Biologist [[Peter Richerson]] and anthropologist [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] argue that a human could not make a watch alone and so a watch does not have a designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richerson &amp; Boyd|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
In the early 20th century, the modernist theology of [[higher criticism]] was contested in the United States by [[biblical literalism|Biblical literalists]], who campaigned successfully against the teaching of evolution and began calling themselves [[creationism|creationists]] in the 1920s. When teaching of evolution was reintroduced into [[public school (government funded)|public schools]] in the 1960s, they adopted what they called ''[[creation science]]'' that had a central concept of design in similar terms to Paley's argument. That idea was then relabeled ''[[intelligent design]]'', which presents the same analogy as an argument against evolution by natural selection without explicitly stating that the "intelligent designer" was God. The argument from the complexity of biological organisms was now presented as the ''[[irreducible complexity]]'' argument,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104  |issue= suppl. 1|pages=8669–76 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17494747 |pmc=1876445 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701505104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17494747 |ref=harv |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8669S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable proponent of which was [[Michael Behe]], and, leveraging off the verbiage of [[information theory]], the ''[[specified complexity]]'' argument, the most notable proponent of which was [[William Dembski]].

The watchmaker analogy was referenced in the 2005 [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial. Throughout the trial, Paley was mentioned several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1pm.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 1 PM session]&lt;/ref&gt; The defense's expert witness [[John Haught]] noted that both [[Intelligent Design]] and the watchmaker analogy are "reformulations" of the same theological argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day5pm.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 5 PM session]&lt;/ref&gt;
On day 21 of the trial, Mr. Harvey walked Dr. Minnich through a modernized version of Paley's argument, substituting a cell phone for the watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day21am2.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 21 AM session]&lt;/ref&gt;
In his ruling, the judge stated that the use of the argument from design by intelligent design proponents "is merely a restatement of the Reverend William Paley's argument applied at the cell level"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 79 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science, page 79]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and that the argument from design is [[Subjectivity|subjective]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e., if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a "purposeful arrangement of parts" is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system."  [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 81 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science, page 81]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''whimbling iron''' is a [[bell clapper]] made from [[ductile iron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ductile.org/didata/default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally bell clappers were standard cast [[grey iron]] with a razor-like crystalline structure that led to sudden catastrophic failure over time. The standard clapper is distinguished by the experienced ear as a whefting iron.  Whilst some believe that the advent of "health and safety" led to the search for an alternative, it is more likely that the ability to forge the bottom end ready for use practically died out early in [[World War II]].  Some attempts at composite clappers were made, but advances in casting technology, driven as much by the motor industry as by the war, resulted in the adoption of spheroidal graphite iron castings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=21]&lt;/ref&gt;
