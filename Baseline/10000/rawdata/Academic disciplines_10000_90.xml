      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">'''ATSTEP''' is a Gaussian puff model for diagnosis and prognosis of the atmospheric dispersion, deposition, gamma radiation and doses of released radioactivity in case of accidents in nuclear power plants or during transport, and from [[dirty bomb]]s.

It was developed by Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (now [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], KIT), one of the largest national research centers in [[Germany]], and is designed for running in the RODOS (Real-time On-line DecisiOn Support) system for nuclear emergency management. RODOS is operational at the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), and test operational in many other European countries. More information on RODOS is available on the RODOS website [https://resy5.iket.kit.edu/RODOS/ here] and on the ATSTEP model [https://resy5.iket.kit.edu/RODOS/Documents/Public/HandbookV6f/Volume3/ATSTEPfinal2.pdf here].

'''Ahl al-Hadith''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الحديث}}, "The people of [[hadith]]"; also ''Așḥāb al-ḥadīṯ''; {{lang|ar|أصحاب الحديث}}, "The adherents of [[hadith]]") first emerged in the 2nd/ 3rd Islamic centuries as a movement of [[hadith]] scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ahl al-Hadith|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-72|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents are also known as '''traditionalists''' and '''traditionists''' (from "tradition" as a translation of the word ''hadith'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hodgson|2009|page=1589 (Kindle location)}}; {{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] Ahl al-Hadith opposed contemporary jurists who based their legal reasoning on informed opinion (''ra'y'') or living local practice, referred to as [[Ahl ar-Ra'y]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against the [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent leader of the movement was [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; Subsequently, all Sunni [[Madhhab|legal schools]] gradually came to accept the reliance on the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement,&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; while [[al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) used rationalistic argumentation favored by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Khalid |last=Blankinship| authorlink = Khalid Yahya Blankinship | year=2008 | title=The early creed |editor=Tim Winter|volume=The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition)|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries the term ''ahl al-hadith'' came to refer to the scholars, mostly of the [[Hanbali|Hanbali madhhab]], who rejected rationalistic theology (''[[kalam]]'') and held on to the early Sunni creed.&lt;ref name=Brown168&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan A.C. |last=Brown| year=2009 | title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|publisher=Oneworld Publications (Kindle edition)|page=168| quote=In the wake of the tenth-century Ash'ari synthesis, some Muslim theologians still maintained the strict details of the early Sunni creed.

== Origins and general characteristics ==

The Ahl al-Hadith movement emerged toward the end of the eighth century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles, but by the early ninth century they coalesced into a separate movement under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In legal matters, these scholars criticized the use of personal opinion (''ra'y'') common among the [[Hanafi]] jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by [[Malikite]] jurists of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They also rejected the use of ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; Ahl al-Hadith were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They attempted to follow the injunction of "[[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|commanding good and forbidding evil]]" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt;

== Convergence of legal schools ==
{{further|Fiqh|Madhhab}}

The next two centuries witnessed a broad convergence of legal methodologies which gave rise to the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence (''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]''). Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; This "traditionalizing" of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]]'s student [[Al-Shafi‘i]], which laid the foundation of the [[Shafi'i]] legal school.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt;

== Creed ==
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

Ahl al-Hadith believed that the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'' (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of faith and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, accepting them without asking "how" (''[[bi-la kaifa]]''), and asserted that their realities should be consigned to God alone (''[[tafwid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that every part of the Qur'an is uncreated (''ghayr makhluq'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agwan|first1=A. R.|last2=Singh|first2=N. K.|title=Encyclopedia of the Holy Qur'an|date=2000|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=8187746009|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Oneworld Publ., 2006, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; Ahl al-Hadith also held that ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' (faith) increases and decreases in correlation with the performance of prescribed rituals and duties, such as the five daily prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Mason, Humaniora Islamica, Volume 1, p 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological controversies ==
{{Salafi}}
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

In 833 the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (''[[mihna]]'') which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made is subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated and hence coeternal with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|pages=49, 51}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy persisted until [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged  from the work of [[al-Maturidi]] (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni [[madhhab]]s, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who ostensibly persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the scholars who rejected the [[Ash'ari]]/[[Maturidi]] synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|page=2081–2091 (Kindle locations)}}; {{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni "orthodoxy", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.&lt;ref name="Brown 2009 page=180"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brown|2009|page=180}}: "The Ash‘ari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‘orthodoxy.’ But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‘arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‘orthodoxy’ as well."&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by [[Wahhabi]] and other traditionalist [[Salafi]] currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hoover|2014|page=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Brandstädt''' (born 17 January 1949 in [[Arnstadt]], [[East Germany]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].

==Life and work==
He graduated from the Friedrich Schiller [[University of Jena]], [[Germany]], with a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in stochastics in 1976 and a habilitation (Dr. sc. nat.) in complexity theory in 1983.
Since 1974 he worked there in the group of his academic teacher [[Gerd Wechsung]].

From 1991 to 1994, he was the professor for Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics,
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-due.de/mathematik/en_index.php&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Duisburg]], Germany,
and from 1994 to 2014 he was the professor for Theoretical Computer Science&lt;ref&gt;http://users.informatik.uni-rostock.de/~ab&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Rostock]], Germany.

He was a visiting professor at the universities of [[University of Metz|Metz]], [[University of Amiens|Amiens]], and [[University of Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-Ferrand]] ([[France]]) and at the [[University of Primorska]] in [[Koper]]
([[Slovenia]]). He was Invited Speaker at various conferences in [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Brasil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]],
[[Greece]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Switzerland]].

Brandstädt is an active researcher in [[graph algorithms]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[combinatorial optimization]], and [[graph theory]]. A frequently used tool in his papers is tree structure of graphs and hypergraphs such as for [[hypertree]]s, [[strongly chordal graph]]s and [[chordal graph]]s.

He frequently took part in program committees such as Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (and three times was a co-organizer of this
conference) and is member of the [[Editorial Board]] of [[Discrete Applied Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/discrete-applied-mathematics/editorial-board/ Editorial Board of Discrete Applied Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt;

Photo: John Englart]]AMOS has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude, “Global [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] are real and observable…It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of [[greenhouse gases]] in the [[atmosphere]] have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] has increased by more than 30% since the start of the [[industrial age]] and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning [[fossil fuels]], broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amos.org.au/publications/cid/3/t/publications AMOS ''Statement on Climate Change'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auxanography''' is the study of the effects of changes in [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] on the growth of [[microorganisms]], by means of [[auxanogram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Virella | first = Gabriel | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mikrobiologia i choroby zakaźne | publisher = Urban &amp; Partner | year = 2000 | location = Wrocław | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 83-85842-59-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first devised by [[Martinus Beijerinck|Beijerinck]]&lt;ref&gt;Beijerinck, M. W. 1889. L'auxanographie, ou la méthode de l'hydrodiffusion dans la gélatine appliquée aux recherches microbiologiques. Arch. Néerl. Sc. 23:367-372.&lt;/ref&gt; for testing the effect of various nutrient media upon [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="janaganamana1"&gt;[http://janaganamana.net/getMeanings.aspx?jgmsearch=auxanography JANA GANA MANA – auxanography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818201045/http://janaganamana.net/getMeanings.aspx?jgmsearch=auxanography |date=August 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacteria are plated out in a medium known to be poorly adapted for their nourishment, and then drops of the tested solutions are added to the surface of the plate. If the requisite nutrient has been added, the bacteria will develop rapidly in these spots.&lt;ref name="janaganamana1" /&gt;

If one is interested in as many different mutants as possible, one can
e.g. the growth requirement of the mutants using an auxanography test
very easy to detect. It is based on sown on minimal plates
auxotrophic microorganisms grow only at the site of the plate at which the
needed growth substance was applied. One therefore goes in such a case
So before that you have a dense suspension of the mutant on minimal agar
apply and then place filter paper slices at various points,
which were soaked in growth mixtures. The Growth Substance Blends
are compiled so that the same growth substance only in 2
Mixtures occurs. After incubation should therefore be with monoauxotrophic
Mutants show growth each by 2 filter paper slices.
Occasionally di-auxotrophic mutants can also be obtained with this method
identify, then, namely, if both growth substances coincidentally in the same
Mixture occur. Then one finds both growth around this slice
as well as between two other slices, each one of which
contains growth substances required. According to the laws of combinatorics can
when using n mixtures with (n-1) growth substances
(n2 - n) / 2 test fabrics simultaneously.

The '''Carte du Ciel''' (literally, 'Map of the Sky') and the '''Astrographic Catalogue''' (or '''Astrographic Chart''') were two distinct but connected components of a massive international astronomical project, initiated in the late 19th century, to catalogue and map the positions of millions of [[star]]s as faint as 11th or 12th [[stellar magnitude|magnitude]]. Twenty observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 (glass) photographic plates in an enormous observing programme extending over several decades. Despite, or because of, its vast scale, the project was only ever partially successful &amp;ndash; the Carte du Ciel component was never completed, and for almost half a century the Astrographic Catalogue part was largely ignored. However, the appearance of the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] in 1997 has led to an important development in the use of this historical plate material.

==Origins and goals==
A vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by [[Paris Observatory]] director [[Amédée Mouchez]], who realized the potential of the new [[Dry plate|dry plate photographic process]] to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars.  As a result of the Astrographic Congress of more than 50 astronomers held in Paris in April 1887, 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project, and two goals were established:

For the first, the Astrographic Catalogue, the entire sky was to be photographed to 11&amp;nbsp;mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8&amp;nbsp;mag &amp;ndash; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component (the Carte du Ciel).  Different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones (see table). The Astrographic Catalogue plates, of typically 6&amp;nbsp;minutes exposure, were in due course photographed, measured, and published in their entirety. They yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5&amp;nbsp;mag, and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century.

For the second goal, a second set of plates, with longer exposures but minimal overlap, was to photograph all stars to 14&amp;nbsp;mag. These plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts, the Carte du Ciel, in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments.  Most of the Carte du Ciel plates used three exposures of 20&amp;nbsp;minutes duration, displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10&amp;nbsp;arcsec, making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws, and asteroids from stars.

A fascinating contemporary account of this vast international astronomical collaboration, published in 1912, is given by H.H.&amp;nbsp;Turner, then Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Turner, 1912 ''The Great Star Map, Being a Brief General Account of the International Project Known as the Astrographic Chart'' (John Murray)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other aspects are covered in various papers in the Proceedings of IAU Symposium Number&amp;nbsp;133 held in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of IAU Symposium Number&amp;nbsp;133, ''Mapping the Sky'', editor S. Debarbat, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Astrographic Catalogue ==

[[File:Catalogue photographique du Ciel I-VIII.JPG|thumb|left|Catalogue photographique du Ciel I–VIII published by [[Helsinki University Observatory]] in 1937.]]

For the Astrographic Catalogue, 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates (see table). Around half of the observatories ordered telescopes from the [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry|Henry brothers (Paul and Prosper)]] in France, with others coming from the factory of  [[Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd.|Howard Grubb of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These telescopes were termed ''normal [[astrograph]]s'' with an aperture of around 13&amp;nbsp;inches (33&amp;nbsp;cm) and a focal length of 11 feet (3.4 m) designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 [[Arc minute|arcsecs]]/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. Each observatory was assigned a specific declination zone to photograph.  The first such plate was taken in August 1891 at the [[Vatican Observatory]] (where the exposures took more than 27&amp;nbsp;years to complete), and the last in December 1950 at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium|Ukkel Observatory]] (Brussels), with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920.  To compensate for plate defects, each area of the sky was photographed twice, using a two-fold, corner-to-centre overlap pattern, extended at the zone boundaries, such that each observatory's plates would overlap with those of the adjacent zones.  The participating observatories agreed to use a standardized telescope so that all plates had a similar scale of approximately 60&amp;nbsp;arcsec/mm.  The measurable areas of the plates were 2.1°×2.1° (13&amp;nbsp;cm×13&amp;nbsp;cm), so the overlap pattern consisted of plates that were centred on every degree band in declination, but offset in right ascension by two degrees.  Many factors, such as reference catalogue, reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions. The positional accuracy goal was 0.5&amp;nbsp;arcsec per image.
  
Plate measurement was a protracted affair, with measuring done by eye and recorded by hand.  The plates were turned over to a large number of semi-skilled "computers" to determine the positions of the stars on each plate. (Before its modern meaning, the word "computer" meant a person who performs calculations). The "computers" would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate, and then perform calculations to determine the star's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. The original goal of 11&amp;nbsp;mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed, however, with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13&amp;nbsp;mag.  In total, some 4.6&amp;nbsp;million stars (8.6&amp;nbsp;million images) were observed. The brightest stars were over-exposed on the plates, not measured, and therefore missing in the resulting catalogues.  The plate measurements (as rectangular coordinates), as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates, were published in the original volumes of the Astrographic Catalogue, although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest.  Publication of the measurements proceeded from 1902 to 1964, and resulted in 254 printed volumes of raw data. 
  
For decades the Astrographic Catalogue was largely ignored. The data were difficult to work with because they were available neither in machine-readable form nor in equatorial coordinates. Decades of labour were expended internationally before the project was superseded by modern astronomical techniques.  One problem was that the work took much longer than expected.  As originally envisaged, the project was meant to have taken only 10 to 15 years.  A more serious problem was that while many European astronomers were preoccupied with this project, which required steady, methodical labor rather than creativity, in other parts of the world notably the United States [[astrophysics]] was becoming far more important than [[astrometry]].  As a result, French astronomy in particular fell behind and lagged for decades.

==The Carte du Ciel==
The still-more-ambitious Carte du Ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories, but neither completed nor even started by others. The charts proved to be excessively expensive to photograph and reproduce, generally via engraved copper plates ([[photogravure]]), and many zones were either not completed or properly published. The plates which were taken generally still exist, but cover only half of the sky. They are typically archived at their original observatories. A very few plates have recently been re-measured and re-analysed with the availability  of the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] data (see below).

==Combination of the Astrographic Catalogue with Hipparcos==

The vast amount of work invested in the Astrographic Catalogue, taking plates, measuring, and publishing, looked for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit. But today, astronomers are very much indebted to this great effort because of the possibility of combining these century-old star positions with the results from ESA's [[Hipparcos]] space astrometry satellite, allowing high accuracy proper motions to be derived for 2.5&amp;nbsp;million stars. Specifically, the Astrographic Catalogue positions were transferred from the decades-old printed catalogues into machine readable form (undertaken at the [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]] in Moscow under the leadership of A.&amp;nbsp;Kuzmin) between 1987 and 1994. The data were then reduced anew (at the [[US Naval Observatory]] in Washington under the leadership of Sean Urban), using the reference stars measured by the [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stars from the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the Astrographic Catalogue plates, while the 2.5 million stars in the Tycho-2 Catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected. The proper motions of all the Tycho Catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the Astrographic Catalogue, but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues. Aside from the 120,000 stars of the Hipparcos Catalogue itself, the resulting Tycho-2 Catalogue (compiled at the [[Copenhagen University Observatory]] under the leadership of Erik Høg) is now the largest, most accurate and most complete, star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky. It is currently the basis for deriving positions for all fainter stars on the sky. Sean Urban of the [[US Naval Observatory]] wrote in 1998:&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''The history of the Astrographic Catalogue endeavour is one of dedicated individuals devoting tedious decades of their careers to a single goal. Some believe it is also the story of how the best European observatories of the 19th century lost their leadership in astronomical research by committing so many resources to this one undertaking. Long portrayed as an object lesson in overambition, the Astrographic Catalogue has more recently turned into a lesson in the way that old data can find new uses.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''cleanroom''' or '''clean room''' is a facility ordinarily utilized as a part of specialized industrial production or scientific research, including the manufacture of pharmaceutical items and microprocessors. Cleanrooms are designed to maintain extremely low levels of particulates, such as dust, airborne organisms, or vaporized particles. Cleanrooms typically have an cleanliness level quanitified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a predetermined molecule measure. The ambient outdoor air in a typical urban area contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm and bigger in measurement, equivalent to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while by comparison an ISO 1 cleanroom permits no particles in that size range and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller.

==History==
The modern cleanroom was invented by American [[physicist]] [[Willis Whitfield]].&lt;ref name=nkwes&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Yardley|title=Willis Whitfield, Clean Room Inventor, Dies at 92 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/willis-whitfield-clean-room-inventor-dies-at-92.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As employee of the [[Sandia National Laboratories]], Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable [[airflow]]s. Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities.&lt;ref name=nkwes/&gt; Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than 50 billion USD in sales worldwide.&lt;ref name=kwes&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Sandia physicist, cleanroom inventor dies at 92 |url=http://www.kwes.com/story/20187574/sandia-physicist-cleanroom-inventor-dies-at-92 |work=[[KWES-TV|KWES]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/reinraum_printline_02_2015_Whitfield_110416.pdf|title=Willis Whitfield - Father of the Cleanroom|date=September 2015|publisher=Cleanroom online|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;!--Document specified as "02-2015", pathway as 2014-11, http date as 2016-04-19 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley were made by three companies: MicroAire, PureAire, and Key Plastics.  These competitors made laminar flow units, glove boxes, clean rooms and air showers, along with the chemical tanks and benches used in the 'Wet Process' building of integrated circuits.  These three companies were the pioneers of the use of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] for airguns, chemical pumps, scrubbers, water guns, and other devices needed for the production of [[integrated circuit]s. William (Bill) C. McElroy Jr. worked as engineering manager, drafting room supervisor, QA/QC, and designer for all three companies and his designs added 45 original patents to the technology of the time.  McElroy also wrote a four page article for MicroContamination Journal, wet processing training manuals, and equipment manuals for wet processing and clean rooms.&lt;ref&gt;William (Bill) C.

==Overview==
Cleanrooms can be very large. Entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. They are used extensively in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor manufacturing]], [[biotechnology]], the [[life sciences]], and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination. There are also modular cleanrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecart-cleanrooms.com/what-is-a-cleanroom/ What is a modular cleanroom?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The air entering a cleanroom from outside is [[filter (air)|filter]]ed to exclude dust, and the air inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air ([[HEPA]]) and/or ultra-low particulate air ([[ULPA]]) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.

Staff enter and leave through [[airlock]]s (sometimes including an [[air shower (room)|air shower]] stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.

Equipment inside the cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination. Only special [[mop]]s and [[bucket]]s are used. Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean.

Common materials such as [[paper]], [[pencil]]s, and [[Textile|fabric]]s made from natural fibers are often excluded, and alternatives used. Cleanrooms are not [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] (i.e., free of uncontrolled microbes);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09clea.html?ref=science In NASA’s Sterile Areas, Plenty of Robust Bacteria] New York Times, 9. October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; only airborne particles are controlled. Particle levels are usually tested using a [[particle counter]] and microorganisms detected and counted through environmental monitoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=Application of quality risk management to set viable environmental monitoring frequencies in biotechnology processing and support areas|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=560–79|date=November 2012 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2012.00891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=A review of cleanroom microflora: types, trends, and patterns|journal=[[PDA (journal)|PDA J Pharm Sci Technol]] |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=392–403|date=November 2011 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2011.00765}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymer]] tools used in cleanrooms must be carefully determined to be [[Chemical compatibility|chemically compatible]] with cleanroom processing fluids &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkinen|first=Ismo T.S.|last2=Kauppinen|first2=Christoffer|last3=Liu|first3=Zhengjun|last4=Asikainen|first4=Sanja M.|last5=Spoljaric|first5=Steven|last6=Seppälä|first6=Jukka V.|last7=Savin|first7=Hele|date=2018-10|title=Chemical compatibility of fused filament fabrication-based 3-D printed components with solutions commonly used in semiconductor wet processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|journal=Additive Manufacturing|volume=23|pages=99–107|doi=10.1016/j.addma.2018.07.015|issn=2214-8604|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ensured to generate a low level of particle generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasanen|first=T.P.|last2=von Gastrow|first2=G.|last3=Heikkinen|first3=I.T.S.|last4=Vähänissi|first4=V.|last5=Savin|first5=H.|last6=Pearce|first6=J.M.|date=2019-01|title=Compatibility of 3-D printed devices in cleanroom environments for semiconductor processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|journal=Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing|volume=89|pages=59–67|doi=10.1016/j.mssp.2018.08.027|issn=1369-8001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cleanrooms are kept at a [[positive pressure]] so if any leaks occur, air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in.

Some cleanroom [[HVAC]] systems control the [[humidity]] to such low levels that extra equipment like [[Air_ioniser|air ionizers]] are required to prevent [[electrostatic discharge]] problems.

Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes, with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a [[cleanroom suit]].

In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous, the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower. An anteroom (known as a "gray room") is used to put on clean-room clothing.

Some manufacturing facilities do not use fully classified cleanrooms, but use some practices or technologies typical of cleanrooms to meet their contamination requirements.

In [[Hospital]]s, [[Operating theater|Theatre]]s are similar to cleanroom for surgical patients' operation with [[Surgical incision|incisions]] to prevent any infections for the patient.

|}

Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either [[HEPA]] or [[ULPA]] filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2010/02/clean-room-classification-aspects-of.html Limits for Microbial load for clean room as per US FDA and EU Guidelines for pharmaceutical products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/automation-electronics/Cleanroom-Air-Flow-Principles Cleanroom Air Flow Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personnel contamination of cleanrooms==
{| class="centered"
|- style="vertical-align:top"

The greatest threat to cleanroom contamination comes from the users themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ansi.org/2015/07/cleanroom-and-controlled-environment/|title=Cleanroom and Controlled Environment Attire - ANSI Blog|date=2015-07-15|work=The ANSI Blog|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, control of microorganisms is important, especially microorganisms likely to be deposited into the air stream from skin shedding. Studying cleanroom microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends. Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the “norm” such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices.

In assessing cleanroom microorganisms, the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower number. Common bacterial genera include ''Micrococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', ''Corynebacterium'', and ''Bacillus'', and fungal genera include ''Aspergillus'' and ''Pencillin''.&lt;ref name="Sandle, T 392–403"/&gt;

==Cleanroom classification and standardization==
Cleanrooms are classified according to the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air. Large numbers like "class 100" or "class 1000" refer to [[FED-STD-209E]], and denote the number of particles of size 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per cubic foot of air. The standard also allows interpolation; for example [[SNOLAB]] is maintained as a class 2000 cleanroom.

A discrete, light-scattering airborne particle counter is used to determine the concentration of airborne particles, equal to and larger than the specified sizes, at designated sampling locations.

Small numbers refer to [[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] standards, which specify the decimal [[logarithm]] of the number of particles 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm or larger permitted per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air. So, for example, an ISO class 5 cleanroom has at most 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Both FS 209E and ISO 14644-1 assume log-log relationships between particle size and particle concentration. For that reason, zero particle concentration does not exist. Some classes do not require testing some particle sizes, because the concentration is too low or too high to be practical to test for, but such blanks should not be read as zero.

Because 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is about 35&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the two standards are mostly equivalent when measuring 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm particles, although the testing standards differ. Ordinary room air is around class 1,000,000 or ISO 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.byu.edu/cleanroom/particlecount.phtml Cleanroom Classification / Particle Count / FS209E / ISO TC209 /&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISO 14644-1 and ISO 14698===
[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] and [[ISO 14698]] are [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] standards developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=53394|title=ISO 14644-1:2015 - Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments -- Part 1: Classification of air cleanliness by particle concentration|website=ISO|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former applies to clean rooms in general (see table below); the latter to cleanrooms where [[contamination|biocontamination]] may be an issue.

[[ISO 14644|ISO 14644-1]] defines the maximum concentration of particles per class and per particle size with the following formula&lt;ref name="Whyte2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Whyte|title=Cleanroom Technology: Fundamentals of Design, Testing and Operation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ufEtmr1sBgC|date=17 October 2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-86842-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N} = 10^{\text{N}} \left(\frac{0.1}{\text{D}}\right)^{2.08}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\text{C}_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum concentration of particles in a volume of 1m&lt;math&gt;^3&lt;/math&gt; of airborne particles that are equal to, or larger, than the considered particle size which is rounded to the nearest whole number, using no more than three significant figures, &lt;math&gt;\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the ISO class number, &lt;math&gt;\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the particle in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m and 0.1 is a constant expressed in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m. The result for standard particle sizes is expressed in the following table.

&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Sample collection limitations for both particles in low concentrations and sizes greater than 1 μm make classification at this particle size inappropriate, due to potential particle losses in the sampling system.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; In order to specify this particle size in association with ISO Class 5, the macroparticle descriptor M may be adapted and used in conjunction with at least one other particle size. (See C.7.)

==Professional life==
Jones received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Wales]] in 1978, on the basis of a doctoral dissertation in three volumes entitled ''The String Quartets of [[Johann Baptist Vanhal|Vanhal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brook and Viano (1997:460)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier (1974) he had been appointed as a Lecturer at [[Cardiff University]], and was subsequently promoted there several times:  Senior Lecturer (1998), Reader (2002), Professorial Chair (2007). He served as Head of School from March 2008 to July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  Jones's web site, cited below&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the editorial board of the journal ''Eighteenth-Century Music'' and the e-journal ''Haydn''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rit.edu/affiliate/haydn/ Journal site]&lt;/ref&gt; He has given lectures and talks at the BBC [[Proms]], the [[Edinburgh Festival]], and at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] and other major venues.&lt;ref&gt;Jones web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
His book ''Oxford Composer Companions: Haydn'' was awarded a prize by the International Association of Music Librarians (UK and Ireland) in 2002. He has served as chairman of the Music Libraries Trust since 2005 and was elected a Vice President of the [[Royal Musical Association]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Jones web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Jones's books incorporate a large amount of factual information, much of it from recent scholarly research. He tends to favor trustworthy over vivid sources (e.g. for Haydn, the sober [[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]], in preference to the tale-spinning [[Albert Christoph Dies|Dies]] and [[Giuseppe Carpani|Carpani]]).

'''Degreasing''', often called '''defatting''' or '''fat trimming''', is the removal of fatty acids from an object. In [[culinary]] science, degreasing is done with the intention of reducing the [[fat]] content of a [[meal]].

==Degreasing food==
Degreasing is often used by [[dieting|diet]]ers, particularly those following low-fat diets to reduce their fat consumption to induce weight loss.  The energy content of 1 g of fat is 9 [[calories]], while that of [[carbohydrates]] and [[proteins]] are 4 calories.  Hence, dieters often view decreasing fat consumption as an efficient way of losing weight without greatly sacrificing total volume of food.  Degreasing during meal preparation is used to reduce the energy content of the food being prepared, and degreasing of a prepared food is also often used in social situations where one may have to consume restaurant food which is rich in fat.

Those people who wish to reduce their cholesterol level or fat intake, in particular people with [[hypercholesterolemia]] often use degreasing to reduce their fat consumption.

=== Degreasing of a meal during preparation ===
Fat trimming of a meal can be done during preparation by a variety of methods.  The most common methods involving substituting food items or removal of naturally occurring fat and conservative addition of fat.

Substituting fats is a method in which a certain ingredient is substituted by another ingredient.  A common way of doing this is substituting saturated [[fatty acids]] with unsaturated fatty acids while cooking.  For instance, olive oil can be used instead of butter for seasoning vegetables.

Food items are also substituted to reduce fat content.  For instance, instead of using eggs by using a whole egg, where the egg yolks are high in fat levels, egg whites can instead be used.  Alternatively, [[skimmed milk]] or similar low-fat products can be used as ingredients for [[cooking]].

===Degreasing liquids===
[[File:Degreasing soup.jpg|thumb|right|260px|(''Frozen soup with a layer of fat shown above'') Cooling provides an easy way to degrease food as the fat rises to the surface and solidifies fully.]]

Many different foods can be degreased after preparation. Liquid foods that are high in fat, such as [[braising]] liquids, [[roasting]] juices and [[broth]]s may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]], spoon, or cup as the liquid [[simmer]]s and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half of it on the heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion toward the edge of the saucepan where the fat accumulates.&lt;ref name='wiley'&gt;{{Cite book | year=2002 | title = Glorious French Food: A Fresh Approach to the Classics | author1=James Peterson | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-471-44276-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWSVpBheCnYC&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=degreasing+food | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As braising liquids and broths simmer, they typically throw off more fat and protein and sometimes froth, so it is easier to wait at least a few minutes until the liquid has cooled before degreasing. In making slowly reduced liquids it may be ideal to wait for it to cool even longer.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt; 

As an alternative to a ladle, a [[degreasing cup]] can be used to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a [[teapot]], with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/cooking-terms.html | title = Cooking Terms | accessdate = 2010-08-04 | publisher = New Italian Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;

===Degreasing solid food items===
Some items, such as roasted foods, and other cooked food items, such as pizza, can sometimes be oily and greasy. Degreasing them after preparation may provide a solution to this problem. Fried foods, such as [[French fries]], can often be degreased without decreasing the crispiness of the food item by simply blotting out the oil in the food item with a [[tissue paper]].

==Commercial degreasing==
Many food manufacturing companies such as [[Weight Watchers]] have been developed for people who wish to reduce their fat intake.  The customer need of defatting has also led to the production of low fat products, e.g., low fat cheese.

==Solvent degreasing==
{{Main| Solvent degreasing}}

Solvent degreasing is a process used to prepare a part for further operations such as [[electroplating]] or [[paint]]ing.  Typically it uses [[petroleum]], [[chlorine]], or [[alcohol]] based [[solvent]]s to dissolve the [[machining]] fluids and other contaminants that might be on the part.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian, Serope, Schmid, Steven R. (2006). Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall. 1079.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sickergrube.jpg|thumb|Old drywell.]]
A '''dry well''' or '''drywell''' is an underground structure that disposes of unwanted [[water]], most commonly [[surface runoff]] and [[stormwater]], and in some cases [[greywater]]. It is a covered, porous-walled chamber that allows water to slowly soak into the ground (that is, [[percolation|percolate]]), dissipating into the [[groundwater]]. Such structures are often called a '''soakaway''' in the United Kingdom, a '''soakwell''' in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Jacques|title=Environmentalist|url=http://www.soakwells.com/whatis.html|publisher=Perth Soakwells Pty Ltd|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''soak pit''' in India. 

A [[sump]] in a [[basement]] can be built in drywell form, allowing the [[sump pump]] to cycle less frequently (handling only occasional peak demand). A [[French drain]] can resemble a horizontal dry well that is not covered. A larger open pit or artificial [[swale (landform)|swale]] that receives storm water and dissipates it into the ground is called an [[infiltration basin]] or recharge basin. In places where the amount of water to be dispersed is not as large, a [[rain garden]] can be used instead. 

A dry well is a passive structure.  Water flows through it under the influence of gravity.  A dry well receives water from one or more entry pipes or channels at its top and discharges the same water through a number of small exit openings distributed over a larger surface area in the side(s) and bottom of the dry well.  When a dry well is above the [[water table]], most of its internal volume will contain air.  Such a dry well can accept an initial inrush of water very quickly, until the air is displaced.  After that, the dry well can only accept water as fast as it can dissipate water.  Some dry wells deliberately incorporate a large storage capacity, so that they can accept a large amount of water very quickly and then dissipate it gradually over time, a method that is compatible with the intermittent nature of [[rainfall]].  A dry well maintains the connection between its inflow and outflow openings by resisting collapse and resisting clogging.

Simple dry wells consist of a pit filled with [[gravel]], [[riprap]], [[rubble]], or other [[debris]]. Such pits resist collapse, but do not have much storage capacity because their interior volume is mostly filled by stone.  A more advanced dry well defines a large interior storage volume by a concrete or plastic chamber with perforated sides and bottom.  These dry wells are usually buried completely, so that they do not take up any land area.  The dry wells for a parking lot's storm drains are usually buried below the same parking lot.

A covered pit that disposes of the water component of sewage by the same principle as a dry well is called a [[cesspool]]. A [[septic drain field]] operates on the same slow-drain/large-area principle as an infiltration basin.

Its scope covers scientific research and teaching [[epigraphy]]. It tryes to become more interested on the youngest and the general public.

It has been developed with funding from the Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigraphia3d.es/ |title=Epigraphia 3D - Inicio |website=Epigraphia3d.es |date= |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2013, [[Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología]] (FECYT) funded the project "Descifrando inscripciones romanas en 3D: Ciencia epigráfica virtual" (''Decrypting Roman inscriptions in 3D: virtual epigraphic Science''). This project was proposed as a multidisciplinary work where participate historians, linguists and engineers. Its objective was to provide "the first collection of Roman inscriptions in 3D, worldwide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epigraphia.hypotheses.org/421 |title=Epigraphia 3D: proyecto de innovación científica en epigrafía &amp;#124; E-pigraphia |website=Epigraphia.hypotheses.org |date=1 December 2014|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the epigraphy more interesting to the youngest and facilitating its study.

The first phase comprised the collection 37 inscriptions from [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|Museo Arqueológico Nacional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigüedades Griegas y Romanas.|url=http://www.man.es/man/museo/el-museo-por-dentro/departamentos-investigacion/clasicas.html|website=Museo Arqueológico Nacional|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Natio''nal'' Archaeological Museum of Spain''), of different types (funerary, votive ...) and support (stone, metal, clay ...). It was made a bibliography card for each inscription, with its main data. In 2014 the project was funded again from the FECYT to model a selection of 59 inscriptions from the collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Romano de Mérida]] (National Museum of Roman Art in Mérida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La ULPGC obtiene un nuevo proyecto de innovación científica concedido por la FECYT para digitalizar inscripciones del Museo de Arte Romano de Mérida|url=https://www.ulpgc.es/noticia/ulpgc-obtiene-nuevo-proyecto-innovacion-cientifica-concedido-fecyt-digitalizar-inscripciones|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=ULPGC - Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|date=27 February 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This second phase of the project continues to be developed. Still it is not possible to visualise any of the inscriptions in the official website. However, it can be visualized  the inscriptions that already have been  modelling in the profile of [[Sketchfab]] of Epigraphia 3D.

==Project results==
[[File:Captura_Sketcfab_Epigraphia_3d.png|alt= Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D|thumb|316x316px|Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D]]
At the beginning of 2016, Epigraphia accumulated 97 3D models on Sketchfab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/epigraphia3d/ |title=epigraphia3d on |website=Sketchfab.com |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate = 10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of the publics and with its respective bibliography card.

The project has a website with information about the own project, galleries with the 3D models and a section with "Resources" created by the researchers with the objective of to introduce the Latin epigraphy to the general public. This divulgative section has:
* '''Introduction''': what is epigraphy, its history, specialized resources (journals and databases), about the epigraphic supports and how to study and edit an inscription.
* '''Language and Literature: '''an introduction to [[Latin]], their cases and declensions, transcription of names, verb forms and structure for each type of inscriptions.
* '''Latin script''': on the Latin alphabet and types of writing ([[Roman square capitals]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]]).
* '''Roman family''': introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of the [[Roman family]], marriage and a series of activities.
* '''Roman religion''': introduction to [[Roman temple]], its gods, priests, rites and imperial cult started in the time of [[Augustus]].
* '''Funerary world''': about death and life in the Roman afterlife, and their rites and funerary inscriptions.
Besides, it has an interactive map in which they have marked the origin of each one of the 37 pertaining registrations to the collection.

He was born at [[Dresden]]. In 1755 he was made court architect to the [[Electorate of Saxony]], in 1764 professor of architecture at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] and in 1776 chief architect of Saxony.

The work of Krubascius include palaces for [[Johann Georg, Chevalier de Saxe]], and the [[Landhaus (Dresden)|Landhaus]] of [[Dresden]], completed in 1776 and now housing the [[Dresden City Museum]].  Among his students were [[Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer]] and [[Christian Friedrich Schuricht]].

'''''Hamus''''', '''''hamulus''''', and words derived from them are [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[Anatomy|anatomical]] terms in various branches of [[biology]]. They describe structures functioning as, or in the form of, hooks or hooklets.

==Derived terms==

The terms are directly from [[Latin]], in which ''hamus'' means "[[wikt:Hook|hook]]". The plural is ''hami''.

''Hamulus'' is the [[diminutive]] – hooklet or little hook. The plural is ''hamuli''.

Adjectives are ''hamate'' and ''hamulate'', as in "hamulate wing-coupling", in which the wings of [[Hymenoptera|certain insects]] in flight are joined by hooking hamuli on one wing, into folds on a matching wing. ''Hamulate'' can also mean "having hamuli". The terms ''hamose'', ''hamular'', ''hamous'' and ''hamiform'' also have been used to mean "hooked", or "hook-shaped". Terms such as ''hamate''&lt;ref name="isbn0-398-06179-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund C. | authorlink=Edmund Jaeger|title=A source-book of biological names and terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that do not indicate a diminutive usually refer particularly to a hook at the tip, whereas diminutive terms such as ''hamulose'' tend to imply that something is beset with small hooks.&lt;ref name="isbn0-217-84753-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jackson, Benjamin Daydon |title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms, With Their Derivation and Accent: Includes free bonus books. |publisher=Books LLC |location= |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-217-84753-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-171-91075-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=A dictionary of scientific terms: pronunciation, derivation, and definition of terms in biology, botany, zoology, anatomy, cytology, embryology, physiology |publisher=Nabu Press |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-171-91075-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[File:Hamulus of hamate bone - animation01.gif|thumb|Human left hand with hamulus of hamate bone shown in red]]

In [[vertebrate]] anatomy, a hamulus is a small, hook-shaped portion of a bone, or possibly of other hard tissue.

In human anatomy, examples include:&lt;ref name="isbn1-58255-889-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Carmine D. Clemente PhD |title=Anatomy: A Regional Atlas of the Human Body (ANATOMY, REGIONAL ATLAS OF THE HUMAN BODY (CLEMENTE)) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-58255-889-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[pterygoid hamulus]]
* [[hamulus of hamate bone]]
* [[lacrimal hamulus]]

==Arthropoda==

In [[Arthropoda|arthropod]] morphology hamuli are hooklets, usually in the form of projections of the surface of the [[exoskeleton]]. Hami might be actual [[wikt:Evaginate|evaginations]] of the whole thickness of the exoskeleton. The best-known examples are probably the row of hamuli on the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] edge of the [[Metathorax|metathoracic]] (rear) wings of [[Hymenoptera]] such as the honeybee. The hooks attach to a fold on the [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] edge of the [[Mesothorax|mesothoracic]] (front) wings.

It is less widely realised that similar hamuli, though usually fewer, are used in wing coupling in the [[Sternorrhyncha]], the [[Taxonomic rank|suborder]] of [[aphid]]s and [[scale insect]]s. In the Sternorrhyncha such wing coupling occurs particularly in the males of some species. The rear wings of that suborder frequently are reduced or absent, and in many species the last [[Vestigiality|vestige]] of the rear wing to persist is a futile little strap holding the hamuli, still hooking into the fold of the large front wings.

In those [[Springtail|Springtails (Collembola)]] that have a functional [[Furcula (springtail)|furcula]], the underside of the third [[Abdomen|abdominal segment]] bears a hooked structure, variously called the [[retinaculum]] or hamula. It holds the furcula ready for release in times of emergency.&lt;ref name="isbn0-412-61390-5"&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Imms' General Textbook of Entomology: Volume 1: Structure, Physiology and Development Volume 2: Classification and Biology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-412-61390-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms also are used in descriptive anatomy of some insect genitalia, such as hamuli in various [[Odonata]] and "hamus" for the hooked part of the uncus in male [[Lepidoptera]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-412-61390-5"/&gt;

==Botany==

In [[botany]] such words largely refer to hooked bristles such as the hooks on the [[rachilla]] of [[Uncinia]], which attach the fruit to passing animals, or the similarly functioning hooks on [[Burdock]]s, well known as the alleged inspiration for [[Velcro]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9589">{{short description|The identification of present hazards as the first step in a process to assess risk }}
{{technical|date=March 2013}}
Note: Parts of this article are written from the perspective of aircraft safety analysis techniques and definitions; these may not represent current best practice and the article needs to be updated to represent a more generic description of hazard analysis and discussion of more modern standards and techniques.

A '''hazard analysis''' is used as the first step in a process used to assess [[risk]]. The result of a hazard analysis is the identification of different type of hazards. A [[hazard]] is a potential condition and exists or not (probability is 1 or 0). It may in single existence or in combination with other hazards (sometimes called events) and conditions become an actual Functional Failure or Accident (Mishap). The way this exactly happens in one particular sequence is called a scenario. This scenario has a probability (between 1 and 0) of occurrence. Often a system has many potential failure scenarios. It also is assigned a classification, based on the worst case severity of the end condition. Risk is the combination of probability and severity. Preliminary risk levels can be provided in the hazard analysis. The validation, more precise prediction (verification) and acceptance of risk is determined in the [[Risk assessment]] (analysis). The main goal of both is to provide the best selection of means of controlling or eliminating the risk. The term is used in several engineering specialties, including [[avionics]], [[process engineering|chemical process safety]], [[safety engineering]], [[reliability engineering]] and [[food safety]].[http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-eng%20home.htm]

==Hazards and risk==
A hazard is defined as a "Condition, event, or circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an unplanned or undesirable event."  Seldom does a single hazard cause an accident or a functional failure. More often an accident or operational failure occurs as the result of a sequence of causes. A hazard analysis will consider system state, for example operating environment, as well as failures or malfunctions.

While in some cases, safety or reliability risk can be eliminated, in most cases a certain degree of risk must be accepted. In order to quantify expected costs before the fact, the potential consequences and the probability of occurrence must be considered. Assessment of risk is made by combining the severity of consequence with the likelihood of occurrence in a matrix. Risks that fall into the "unacceptable" category (e.g., high severity and high probability) must be mitigated by some means to reduce the level of safety risk.

IEEE STD-1228-1994 Software Safety Plans prescribes industry best practices for conducting software safety hazard analyses to help ensure safety requirements and attributes are defined and specified for inclusion in software that commands, controls or monitors critical functions. When software is involved in a system, the development and design assurance of that software is often governed by [[DO-178B]]. The severity of consequence identified by the hazard analysis establishes the criticality level of the software. Software criticality levels range from A to E, corresponding to the severity of Catastrophic to No Safety Effect. Higher levels of rigor are required for level A and B software and corresponding functional tasks and work products is the system safety domain are used as objective evidence of meeting safety criteria and requirements.

Recently a leading edge commercial standard was promulgated based on decades of proven system safety processes in DoD and NASA. ANSI/GEIA-STD-0010-2009 (Standard Best Practices for System Safety Program Development and Execution) is a demilitarized commercial best practice that uses proven holistic, comprehensive and tailored approaches for hazard prevention, elimination and control. It is centered around the hazard analysis and functional based safety process.

'''Ibn al-Junayd al-Eskafi''' (َArabic: ابن الجنید الاسکافی) was one of the first eminent [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.

== Early life ==
Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Ahmad Katib Iskafi (tenth century AD/fourth century lunar)&lt;ref name="cgie.org.ir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513|title=دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی:ابن جنید اسکافی|work=cgie.org.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Iskaf]], a region near [[Nahrawan Canal]]  in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9321|title=دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی:اسکافی*|work=cgie.org.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; His date of birth is uncertain. He may have traveled to [[Nishapur]]. He may have visited Muhammed Ibn Hosein Alavi. According to Shaykh Mufid's sayings, it seems that Ibn Jonayd passed most of his life in [[Baghdad]]. He may have had communication with the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|twelfth Imam]].

== Jurisprudence ==
He took a different approach in understanding Shia traditions. He believed in a theological basis for interpretation of [[Hadith]].&lt;ref name="cgie.org.ir" /&gt; He believed that we must commit to Khabar Vahed and Qyas in [[jurisprudence]]. He acted like antecedent jurists such as Fazl ibn Shazan and Younes ibn Abdul Rahman. One of his characteristics in [[Fiqh]] discussion was that he believed  to [[Glossary of Islam|Ihtiyat]] (probability) approximately in most problems. in other words, the principle of Ihtiyyat is prevalent in his juridical works.He employed other ideas in shia jurisprudence such as:
* Acting according to reason and justification
* Challenges with Akhbari school
* Clarity in explaining the reason for a judgment
* Establish dynamic basic for shia jurisprudence&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jannati|the periods of authority|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Legacy ==
His students include [[Shaykh Mufid]], Ahmad ibn Abdoon, [[Shaykh Tusi]]Aandbul Abbas Najjashi.
== Works ==
He had special skill in writing and became known as Katib by scholars.He wrote nearly in all Islamic sciences, particularly jurisprudence, theology and [[apologetics]], such as:
*''Tahzib Al Shia for Ahkam-e-shariah(purification of shia for religion's judgments)''
* ''Al Nosrah Le Ahkam Al Itrat''
* ''Two thousand problems in Shariah''
* ''Traditions of Sshia''
* ''Tabserat A Aref and Naqd Al Zaef''
* ''Kashf Al Asrar''
He also wrote about the art of writing: ''Ilm Al Nijabah Fi Ilm Al Kitabah'' and ''Al Tahrir va Taqrir''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25184">The '''imaging of cultural heritage''' is a necessary part of long term preservation of [[cultural heritage]]. While the physical conditions of objects will change over time, imaging serves as a way to document and represent heritage in a moment in time of the life of the item. Different methods of imaging produce results that are applicable in various circumstances. Not every method is appropriate for every object, and not every object needs to be imaged by multiple methods. In addition to preservation and conservation related concerns, imaging can also serve to enhance research and study of cultural heritage.

== Purpose ==
One reason for imaging objects is to make the items available for study and scholarship without incurring unnecessary harm to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betterlight.com/downloads/whitePaper/wp_museum_lighting.pdf|title=Light Exposure to Sensitive Artworks during Digital Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=6|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing images to scholars, images can also be added to online catalogs and databases to increase the size of the audience interacting with the objects and allow them to view the item with no added risk.

Another reason is for documentary purposes, especially as it relates to conservation. According to the American Institute for Conservation, “Documentation is basic to the ethical practice of conservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging prior to conservation allows conservators to record the current state of the object, which can then be compared to later images following conservation. This allows someone in the future to look back and see the ways in which an item was impacted by conservation. Images taken over different periods of time can also reveal changes in condition and can be used to minimize damage going forward. The [[American Institute for Conservation]]'s Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation is a useful reference guide for the application of digital imaging to the field of conservation. It details guidelines for equipment, techniques, and practices that are in line with best practices for conservation. This covers everything from suggestions for types of cameras and memory cards to discussing processing details and how to apply metadata.

An additional purpose is found in the way imaging enhances scholarship. Different types of imaging can reveal materials and techniques used in creating an object that are not immediately evident with the naked eye.

== Methods ==
There are many methods that are employed in imaging. These may include different types of lighting as well as the use of radiography.  Multiple energy levels and technologies have been used for cultural heritage imaging, including imaging mummy masks with multiple spectral bands of light, different x-ray technologies, optical coherence tomography, and terahertz imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/technologies|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases: Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographing objects under standard conditions is a typical practice to preserve the item in perpetuity, but not every object will need more specialized imaging. Those doing the imaging or requesting the imaging be done will look at each object on a case by case basis to determine the usefulness of specialized imaging. In some cases combinations of different types of imaging will be more effective than one type on its own. This can be seen in projects like the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty]]'s conservation of Guercino’s ''Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/conservators-get-to-know-guercinos-jacob-blessing-the-sons-of-joseph/|title=Conservators Get to Know Guercino's Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Getty's APPEAR project, details of which can be found on a blog by the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/appear-project/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photography ===
[[Photography]] under normal illumination will produce a record of the appearance of an object in standard conditions. Standard conditions typically mean uniform illumination with minimal glare. In conservation, these images will serve as a "before treatment" record. They can also serve as a catalog image for in-house use or an online collection. Following a standard image capture, subsequent images can be taken under various conditions to highlight areas that need treatment or closer monitoring.

==== Raking illumination ====

''Further information:[[Raking light]]''
[[File:Early Bronze Age, Arreton Type Developed Flat Axehead (FindID 139019-194932).jpg|left|thumb|Raking light allows the viewer to see hammering scars that are not evident in standard lighting conditions.]]
Raking illumination highlights texture on the surface of an object. This is achieved by using a single light source at a low angle relative to the object. Images taken under these conditions can reveal deviations in the surface of an object – gouges, scratches, paint loss, bulges, and more. With archaeological objects this may reveal how tools were made or how food was processed (e.g. cut marks on bones). In paintings it can show how the artist used the paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief|title=Raking light and relief|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specular illumination ====

Specular illumination documents the surface sheen of an object. With paintings, it is used to highlight areas of abnormality. While raking illumination will produce a record of these abnormalities with greater clarity, specular illumination is less dependent on the orientation of the light. There are two basic set ups for specular illumination – axial and oblique. An axial setup requires the camera and the light source to be on the same axis. The camera is parallel to the surface of the object, and the light source is next to the camera. An oblique setup requires the camera and the light source to be on opposite sides of the subject, but each are at the same angle relative to the object. Specular light can allow conservators to see tool marks on wooden objects, or indentations that seemed invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/about/services/photographicservices/lightingtechniques|title=Lighting Techniques|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transmitted illumination ====

[[File:US Navy 040924-N-6213R-038 Intelligence Specialist 2nd Class Damon Jenkins of Los Angeles, Calif., reviews aerial reconnaissance imagery on a light table in the Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC).jpg|thumb|Transmitted illumination is similar to the effects of a light table or lightbox on a two dimensional object. |201x201px]]
Transmitted illumination is used to highlight thickness and losses among other things. Transmitted illumination uses a light source that is behind the object being photographed. (For two dimensional objects this has a very similar function to a light table.) This “back lighting” provides a way to see things like cracks and holes as well as revealing the general structure of an item. With something like papyrus, it can help to reveal the condition of the individual fibers. It can also be useful with textiles or basketry items where a tight weave may make it difficult to see damage or clues about how the item was woven.

=== Infrared Photography ===
[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|left|thumb]]
[[Infrared photography]] has been used in conservation since the 1930s. In art the most well-known application is being able to see underdrawings of paintings or changes in composition. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s the Blue Room is a famous example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colourlex.com/project/ir-reflectography/|title=Infrared Reflectography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to enhance legibility of manuscripts and inscriptions, as seen with the Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/?locale=en_US|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Dunhuang Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/papers/infrared/index.html|title=Infrared Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon black ink tends to show up very well under infrared.

=== Ultraviolet Photography ===
[[Ultraviolet photography]] is frequently used for differentiation and characterization of materials. Ultraviolet radiation can cause materials to emit fluorescence that can be seen and photographed. The intensity and color of the fluorescence is influenced by the amount of material, the types of materials, and the amount of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV radiation can also reveal things not visible to the naked eye. Codex Sinaiticus contains the oldest, complete copy of the New Testament. On the last page of the Gospel of John UV radiation shows that the final sentence was added later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Edition of the New Testament|last=Trobisch|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the implications for this are rooted in biblical scholarship, this shows that there is more to manuscripts than what is found at the surface level. In conservation this shows that with UV radiation even the “invisible” becomes part of the record for the object and must be documented and monitored.

With paintings, UV can reveal where prior restorations have occurred. The varnish on top of a painting is usually more fluorescent than the pigments. If there is paint on top of a varnish, the conservator knows that there has been some restoration in the past. UV can also help to reveal materials used in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/ultra-violet-light|title=Ultra-violet light|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) ===
[[File:ArPalimTyp2.jpg|left|thumb|The original text of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] can be seen after imaging.|343x343px]]
A [[Multispectral image]] is an image with capture points across the light spectrum. Different wavelengths of light are separated by filters or illuminated with narrow bands of light. These filters can also be combined with different colors of light as well as IR and UV to produce different results and fluorescence. MSI has been used in several major projects regarding ancient manuscripts. Not only is this useful for making these texts legible and available, but these images are useful for conservation. By recording things that are not easily seen, MSI helps conservators to be aware of what they couldn’t see and allows them to monitor these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in examples of paintings like the Mummy Portraits. The Penn Museum has shown through MSI that one of their portraits has an outline of the figure etched in the paint. This is something that was not visible under standard conditions, and something they didn't notice on other portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/2016/01/15/appear-project-multispectral-imaging-on-the-fayum-mummy-portraits/|title=APPEAR Project – Multispectral Imaging on the Fayum Mummy Portraits|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSI also helps scholars to be able to read previously illegible texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest (further discussed below) is a famous example of this, but many other [[palimpsest]]s have been rendered legible by this process. Multiple groups, institutions and companies work to image manuscripts using MSI and other methods to digitally preserve them, make them accessible to scholars, and improve legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/bitstreams/2017/04/24/multispectral-imaging-whats-good/|title=Multispectral Imaging, What's It Good For?|website=Duke University Libraries|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) ===
[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] can help reveal layers and 3D visualizations of text in various media, including papyrus and paper. It has been used with multispectral imaging to provide more information about text and ink on different layers of an object. This has been used in research into papyrus mummy mask cartonnage to 
image  small  areas  of  cartonnage in conjunction with narrowband multispectral imaging to reveal ink layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/pubs/ISTMummy_OCT_MSI.pdf|title=Integrating Optical Imaging of Mummy Mask Cartonnage|website=|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) ===
[[Reflectance Transformation Imaging]] uses special procedures to create a [[Polynomial texture mapping|polynomial texture map]] of an object. These PTMs are created from a set of images using a stationary camera and a single source of light that can be held in different positions.

The following is quoted from Cultural Heritage Imaging's website:

"RTI images are created from information derived from multiple digital photographs of a subject shot from a stationary camera position. In each photograph, light is projected from a different known, or knowable, direction. This process produces a series of images of the same subject with varying highlights and shadows. Lighting information from the images is mathematically synthesized to generate a mathematical model of the surface, enabling a user to re-light the RTI image interactively and examine its surface on a screen.

Each RTI resembles a single, two-dimensional (2D) photographic image. Unlike a typical photograph, reflectance information is derived from the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the image subject and encoded in the image per pixel, so that the synthesized RTI image “knows” how light will reflect off the subject. When the RTI is opened in RTI viewing software, each constituent pixel is able to reflect the software's interactive “virtual” light from any position selected by the user. This changing interplay of light and shadow in the image discloses fine details of the subject's 3D surface form.

RTI was invented by Tom Malzbender and Dan Gelb, research scientists at Hewlett-Packard Labs. A landmark paper describing these first tools and methods, named Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM), was published in 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/|title=Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI): What is it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI has several applications for cultural heritage. In many instances PTMs can improve the legibility of inscriptions, such as metal amulets whose inscriptions have been obscured by corrosion. PTMs have also been found to be useful in analyzing ceramics and paintings. Cracks and pitting that wasn't visible under standard conditions became visible using RTI. The Tate and the National Gallery investigated the use of PTMs and determined that they could be viable alternatives to raking light; especially since PTMs were found to be more easily replicated than raking light photographs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=E.M.|title=Imaging Techniques in Conservation|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=17–29|doi=10.5334/jcms.1021201|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With manuscripts RTI can highlight the shape and structure of pages. While these pages are typically viewed as two dimensional items, RTI makes them three dimensional and shows that there is more than just a flat page. This is helpful for legibility (for scholars) and for condition (for conservators). Scholars can see the text more clearly and may even be able to see text that was erased. This is especially true in conditions where the ink "ate" letter-shaped holes into the page surface. Conservators can use the PTMs to determine the degree of damage to the surface, as cracks, buckling, and holes become much more pronounced.

For examples of the types of results RTI can produce see the videos on Cultural Heritage Imaging's Website http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/

=== Radiography ===
{{see|Radiography of cultural objects}}
[[Radiography]] is a non-destructive analysis of the internal structure of an object, that uses x-rays to create an image. For paintings this means that conservators can potentially see the inner structure of the painting and learn about the materials and techniques used by the original artist. Radiography can also be used on archaeological objects or sculptures to learn more about the internal structure of the items that would otherwise be invisible without destroying the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/45/086/45086050.pdf|title=Application of Digital Radiography in the Analysis of Cultural Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging produces a two-dimensional image of the inner workings of the item. X-ray technology has been used to read the damaged [[Herculaneum papyri|Herculaneum Papyri]] as opposed to trying to unroll the scroll to read its contents. As part of a conservation measure on the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] x-rays were created to better understand how the piece was painted and put together. Images from that project can be viewed on the [http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/#intro Closer to Van Eyck website]. On the Penn [https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/x-radiography/ Museum's Artifact Lab blog] there are multiple entries discussing the applications of radiography on cultural heritage.

[[CT scan|CT Scan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s create a three-dimensional image from many 2-D radiographic images. This produces cross sections of images and allows for the isolation of layers. Like the 2-D images, this allows for a look at the inner sections of objects without causing damage. CT scans have been used on mummies (more similar to traditional medical uses of CT scans) as well as other objects, like cuneiform tablets. CT scans have also been used on papyrus scrolls to digitally unroll them - allowing for them to be read, but not causing any harm. The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London has used CT scans to take images of some of their specimens and create 3D models. This is a much less invasive technique than the traditional model of molding and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of these applications have the goal of being as noninvasive as possible while still trying to gather as much information as possible.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is a technique used in radiology that does not use x-rays. It is mainly used in medical imaging to generate images of the organs of the body. It can also be applied to deceased individuals. For example, a female burial from Novosibirsk, Russia was found to have suffered from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/2628-141016-ukok-princess-cancer|title=MRI Shows 'Princess Ukok' Suffered From Breast Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging allows for a noninvasive analysis of past individuals to help scientists better understand past human ancestors.

== Examples ==
There are hundreds and possibly thousands of examples of projects that use noninvasive imaging techniques. Highlighted here are several that are more commonly known.

=== Archimedes Palimpsest ===
[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|left|thumb|Archimedes Palimpsest]]
The [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] is a parchment manuscript that contains writings from two different time periods. In the 13th century monks erased and wrote over a 10th century copy of some works originally written by Archimedes. Through a combination of different imaging techniques (MSI, raking illumination and X-ray fluorescence) and various processing procedures the older layer became legible.

=== Syriac Galen Palimpsest ===
The Syriac Galen Palimpsest is a parchment manuscript with an early translation of the Greek medical philosopher Galen of Pergamon overwritten with psalms for days of the week.  MSI and later x-ray fluorescence were used to reveal the undertext of Galen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/medicines-hidden-roots-in-an-ancient-manuscript.html|title=Medicine's Hidden Roots in an Ancient Manuscript|website=New York Times|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian mummies ===
With the use of imaging technologies, research can be conducted on mummies without having to unwrap them. A 2014 exhibition at the British Museum highlighted these imaging techniques in conjunction with the eight mummies that were imaged. The CT scans produced allow for a digital layer by layer look at the burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ancient_lives,_new_discoveries.aspx?fromShortUrl|title=Eight mummies|website=British Museum|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummy masks have been studied with six different imaging technologies in a global project involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the feasibility of using non-destructive digital imaging technology to make texts visible in images of papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform tablets and envelopes ===
CT scanners have been used to look at cuneiform tablets layer by layer in order to reproduce them with a 3D printer. This has been done at Cornell University and at TU Delft (“Scanning for Syria”) where scans were done of silicon molds rather than original tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/en/research/stories-of-science/geoscience-engineering/scanning-for-syria/|title=Scanning for Syria|website=Delft University of Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a presentation titled, “Using CT to Image and 3D print Cuneiform Tablets without Removing Them from Their Envelopes,” at the ASOR annual meeting in 2016 Dr. Andrew Shortland discussed how his team had figured out a way to isolate the inner tablet from the envelope and read what was on it without breaking the outer, envelope layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asor.org/am/2016/documents/2016%20ASOR%20Program%20Book.pdf|title=ASOR Program Guide 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial Technology programs typically include instruction in optimization theory, human factors, organizational behavior, industrial processes, industrial planning procedures, computer applications, and report and presentation preparation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences: Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). Retrieved on October 26, 2009 from http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=15.0612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ATMAE Membership Venn Diagram. {{cite web |url=http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113190247/http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and designing manufacturing processes and equipment is a main aspect of being an industrial technologist. An Industrial Technologist is often responsible for implementing certain designs and processes.
== Accreditation and certification ==

The USA based [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in Industrial Technology in the USA. An instructor or graduate of an Industrial Technology program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[Production Planning]] &amp; Control, Safety, Quality, and Management/Supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Industrial Technology programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in
the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge base ==

"A career in industrial technology typically entails formal education from an accredited college or university. Opportunities are available to professionals with all levels of education. Those who hold associate degrees typically qualify for entry-level technician and technologist positions, such as in the maintenance and operation of machinery. Bachelor's degree-holders could fill management and engineering positions, such as plant manager, production supervisor and quality systems engineering technologist. A graduate degree in industrial technology could qualify individuals for jobs in research, teaching and upper-level management".&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

Industrial Technology includes wide-ranging subject matter and could be viewed as an amalgamation of [[industrial engineering]] and business topics with a focus on practicality and management of technical systems with less focus on actual engineering of those systems.

Typical curriculum at a four-year university might include courses on [[manufacturing|manufacturing process]], technology and impact on society, mechanical and electronic systems, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control|control]], [[materials science]], [[packaging]], [[Operations management|production and operations management]], and manufacturing facility planning and design. In addition, the Industrial Technologist may have exposure to more [[Vocational education|vocational-style education]] in the form of courses on [[CNC]] manufacturing, [[welding]], and other tools-of-the-trade in manufacturing.

== Industrial technologist ==

Industrial technology program graduates obtain a majority of positions which are applied engineering and/or management oriented.  Since "industrial technologist" is not a common job title in the United States, the actual bachelor's degree or associate degree earned by the individual is obscured by the job title he/she receives. Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a bachelor's degree include quality systems engineering technologist, manufacturing engineering technologist, industrial engineering technologist, plant manager, production supervisor, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Common Industrial Technology Jobs "&gt;{{cite web|title= What Are Some Common Jobs in the Field of Industrial Technology? |url=http://learn.org/articles/What_are_Some_Common_Jobs_in_the_Field_of_Industrial_Technology.html|publisher=utr zfeqaLearn.org|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical job titles for industrial technologists having a two-year associate degree include project technologist, manufacturing technologist, process technologist, etc.&lt;ref name="Benefits of Industrial Technology"/&gt;

A technologist curriculum may focus or specialize in a certain technical area of study. Examples of this includes [[electronics]], [[manufacturing]], [[construction]], [[graphics]], [[automation]]/[[robotics]], [[CADD]], [[nanotechnology]], [[aviation]], etc.

== Technological development in industry ==

A major subject of study is technological development in industry. This has been defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the introduction of new tools and techniques for performing given tasks in production, distribution, data processing (etc.);
* the mechanization of the production process, or the achievement of a state of greater autonomy of technical production systems from human control, responsibility, or intervention;
* changes in the nature and level of integration of technical production systems, or enhanced interdependence;
* the development, utilization, and application of new scientific ideas, concepts, and information in production and other processes; and
* enhancement of technical performance capabilities, or increase in the efficiency of tools, equipment, and techniques in performing given tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. ''Technological Development in Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', ISR Publications, Manchester UK, revised second edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-29-4}}.  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studies in this area often employ a multi-disciplinary research methodology and shade off into the wider analysis of [[business]] and [[economic growth]] (development, performance). The studies are often based on a mixture of industrial field research and desk-based data analysis and aim to be of interest and use to practitioners in business management and investment (etc.) as well as academics. In [[engineering]], [[construction]], [[textiles]], [[food]] and [[drugs]], [[chemicals]] and [[petroleum]], and other industries, the focus has been on not only the nature and factors facilitating and hampering the introduction and utilization of new technologies but also the impact of new technologies on the production organization (etc.) of firms and various social and other wider aspects of the technological development process.&lt;ref&gt;''Technological Development In Industry: A Business-Economic Survey and Analysis'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

How and When Technological development in industry Performed :
#Technological Processes based always on (Material, Equipment, Human skills and operating circumstances.
#So, If any of these parameters changed, we have to re-calibrate this technology to match the designed product.
#This re-calibration can't be considered as a technology change because industrial technology is not more than an Engineering guide to achieve the required specification of the designed product.
#To calibrate any industrial technology, we should make a documented copy of manufacturing experiments until matching the final product specifications based on original technology, new changed parameters and scientific basics.
#Finally, documentation of the new change should be done to the original industrial technology for that new case as a new addition.
#Any application of industrial technology for 1st time or after a long time stop,Technology processes should be tested by a primary samples triers as a Re-calibration process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Intangible Asset Finance''' is the branch of [[finance]] that deals with [[intangible assets]] such as [[patents]] (legal intangible) and [[reputation]] (competitive intangible). Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[risk]], and [[time]].

== Basic principles ==

In 2003, one estimate put the [[economic equilibrium]] of intangible assets in the U.S. [[economy]] at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic [[corporations]] in the first quarter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RmFLUk7NydQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intangible+Assets:+Values,+Measures+and+Risks,&amp;sig=W2d87NPMzvfWlTDrmUNijOziu-8#PPA28,M1 "A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment," Leonard Nakamura in '''Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks''' at 28, Hand &amp; Lev, Oxford University Press (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the "hidden value" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset [[management]].

Intangible assets include [[business processes]], Intellectual Property (IP) such as [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[reputation]]s for [[ethics]] and [[integrity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], [[sustainability]], [[security]], and [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. Today, these intangibles drive [[cash flow]] and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, [[management]], [[risk forecasting]] and [[risk transfer]] are growing services as the [[economic base]] divests itself of physical [[assets]]. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold; ''Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens''; Springer Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.

*'''Patent Licensing &amp; Enforcement Companies ("P-LECs")''': These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is [[NTP, Inc.]], which has successfully asserted patents related to email [[push technology]]. Another name for a P-LEC is "[[patent troll]]," although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, [[hedge funds]] have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation.   One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in [[New York City]].
*'''Royalty stream securitizers''': These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeal.com/newsweekly/features/a-seller's-market.php#bottom "A seller's market," The Deal, September 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first [[pharmaceutical]] patent-backed securitization to be rated by [[Standard and Poors]], which involved a patent on the [[HIV]] drug [[Zerit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rESRFPqSKzQC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=zerit+patent+securitization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sN9S5ZWcrM&amp;sig=LhlE-nYfxXddjCKeoGql6ap5KxM&amp;hl=en#PPA487,M1 "Avoiding Transaction Peril," Heller et al., in '''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property''' at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were [[Yale]] (the owner of the patent) and [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].
*'''Reinsurers''': These are firms that use the techniques of [[reinsurance]] to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue [[Catastrophe bond|cat bonds]] to mitigate the risks associated with [[extreme weather]], [[earthquake]]s, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue "intangible asset risk-linked securities" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in [[Pittsburgh]], is a [[thought leader]] regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelcityre.com/accelerating_innovation.shtml Steel City Re]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market makers''': Firms that are working to provide more [[liquidity]] to the market for intellectual property. Early [[market maker]]s offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceantomo.com/press/Europe_Auction_Catalogue_Release_4.22.08.pdf Ocean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world’s first [[stock exchange]] with an intellectual property focus.
*'''Investment Research Firms''': Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues.   Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Significant transactions ==

*'''1997''':  [[David Bowie]] securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing [[Bowie Bonds]].
*'''2000''': BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering [[Stavudine]], which is a [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting [[scandal]] at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature [[amortization]] of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] as it involved a single patent and a single [[licensee]].
*'''2005''': UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG [[Max Azria]]'s royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first "whole company securitization" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by [[NexCen Brands, Inc.]] in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/idUS107689+13-May-2010+BW20100513 NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2005''': Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property.
*'''2006''':  [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s film rights securitization in conjunction with [[Ambac Financial Group]] to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a [[credit facility]] for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and [[intellectual property]] related to some of Marvel’s most popular [[comic book]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambac.com/pdfs%5CDeals%5Cmarvel.pdf Ambac's press release, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits ==

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States National Academies]] hosted a one-day conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth."

[[The Intangible Asset Finance Society]] provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.

The Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to
public education and research on the emerging global [[information economy]]. On April 16, 2008 it published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenaalliance.org/pdf/IntangibleAssetMonetization.pdf "Intangible Asset Monetization: The Promise and the Reality"]&lt;/ref&gt; a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4754">[[Image:KeysNotes.jpg|thumb|This is what the system looks like on an actual keyboard.]]
A '''keyboard tablature''' is a [[tablature]] for a [[keyboard instrument]] such as the [[piano]]. The most common keyboard tablature is written using letters and numbers that designate the timing and keys to hit on a keyboard or piano.

Modern piano tablature is based on [[scientific pitch notation]], a variation of [[letter notation]] which has roots going back to the 11th century when Italian [[Guido of Arezzo]] developed [[Solfege]].

== Piano tab notation ==

An example of modern piano tab notation, the scale of F played on 2 octaves:
&lt;pre&gt;
3|--------c-d-e-f-|
2|f-g-a-A---------|
2|--------c-d-e-f-|
1|f-g-a-A---------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some of the rules for this keyboard tablature are:
* The numbers on the left (3, 2, 2 and 1 in the above example) indicate the octave. All octaves start on the c key. Octave 4 is in the middle of the keyboard (starting on c4, or [[middle C]]).
* Lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) indicate the note names as natural (white keys).
* Uppercase letters (A, C, D, F, G) indicate the note names as sharp (black keys). Using the hash symbol # is also acceptable (A#, C#, D#, F#, G#) but not recommended because it takes extra space.
* The | symbols separate measures or sections of notes.
* The - symbols are used for spacing.

Another example of piano tab notation, the chords E, F, and G:
&lt;pre&gt;
   E   F   G
3|---|-c-|-d-|
2|-b-|-a-|-b-|
2|-G-|-f-|-g-|
2|-e-|---|---|
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Periodic system ==

Another keyboard tablature (though less frequently seen) is based on a periodic system of numbers, like most modern tablatures, although incorporating negative and positive numbers assigned to the [[clef]]s (as positive for the [[treble clef]] and negative for the [[bass clef]]). This particular method uses the [[middle C]] as the reference point. Unlike many tab forms the keyboard tab has far different placement values, meaning, regardless of the arrangement of the numbers it can still have the same value, but is displayed differently.

=== Visual example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
12   12    12    12   12  12   12    12
07   07    07    07   09  09   09    09
04   04    04    04   04  04   04    04
   0    0   0     0    0   0    0     0
          -12 -8 -7 -5       -3   -3    -3
P-----------X          P-----------X
&lt;/pre&gt;

(a basic C, Am/C, progression)

=== How to compile ===

The numbers are projected and arranged by value. The particular number is placed in the corresponding column; however, columns are "pushed upward" when notating chords. This "column" system is not affective of the tab itself, more so the appearance, thus it is basically irrelevant. 
* Column 4 = Double digit positive numbers (10+)
* Column 3 = Double digit positive numbers (0-09)
* Column 2 = Single digit negative numbers (-1,-9)
* Column 1 = Double digit negative numbers (-10+)

=== Special notations ===
* A [[grace note]] is shown using smaller numbers as the grace notes, relative to basic music notation. Example: &lt;sup&gt;0 05&lt;/sup&gt; 12
* A [[glissando]] is shown with the start location of the gliss and the stop location. Example: 32------0
* A tremble, rapid alternating between two notes, is indicated with equals signs. Example: 5=====12
* Pedal use is indicated with the P and X characters. This shows when the pedal is held (---) and when released (X). P-------X
* An inaudible or hard to hear note is indicated with parenthesis. Example: (12)

== DecPlay system ==

Another keyboard tablature that has been awarded a US patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/play-piano-in-one-hour/|title=A dream invention turns into a business|last=Bryne|first=Brendan|date=1 October 2016|work=Bank of Ireland - Think Business|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the DecPlay method, which uses a series of numbers, patterns and colours to enable users to play chords and melodies quickly, has been featured on the BBC and is used in over 70 different countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/decplay-hits-the-right-note-879218|title=Decplay hits the right note|last=|first=|date=18 January 2013|work=Manchester Evening News|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1900 ==
===1903===

* Magician and inventor [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]] disrupts [[John Ambrose Fleming]]'s public demonstration of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s purportedly secure [[wireless telegraphy]] technology, sending insulting [[Morse code]] messages through the auditorium's projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marks |first=Paul |title=Dot-dash-diss: The gentleman hacker's 1903 lulz |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228440-700-dot-dash-diss-the-gentleman-hackers-1903-lulz/ |accessdate=January 11, 2012 |newspaper=New Scientist |date=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==

===1932===
* Polish cryptologists [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]] broke the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma machine]] code.

===1939===
* [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]] and [[Harold Keen]] worked together to develop the [[Bombe]] (on the basis of Rejewski's works on [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]). The [[Enigma machine]]'s use of a reliably small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force.

==1940s==
===1943===
* [[René Carmille]], [[comptroller]] general of the Vichy [[French Army]], hacked the [[punched card]] system used by the Nazis to locate Jews.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Amanda |url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-focus/technology-history/a-history-of-hacking |title=A History of Hacking - IEEE - The Institute |website=Theinstitute.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1949 ===

*The theory that underlies computer viruses was first made public in 1949, when computer pioneer [[John von Neumann]] presented a paper titled "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata." In the paper von Neumann speculated that computer programs could reproduce themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-did-the-term-compute/|title=When did the term 'computer virus' arise?|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s==
===1955===
* At [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], “hack” first came to mean fussing with machines. The minutes of an April, 1955, meeting of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] state that "Mr. Eccles requests that anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn the power off to avoid fuse blowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yagoda|first1=Ben|title=A Short History of "Hack"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1957===
* [[Joybubbles|Joe "Joybubbles" Engressia]], a blind seven-year-old boy with perfect pitch, discovered that whistling the fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2600&amp;nbsp;Hz) would interfere with AT&amp;T's automated telephone systems, thereby inadvertently opening the door for [[phreaking]].

==1960s==
* Various [[phreaking boxes]] are used to interact with automated telephone systems.

===1963===
* The first ever reference to malicious [[security hacker|hacking]] is '[[phreaking|telephone hackers]]' in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s student newspaper, ''The Tech'' of hackers tying up the lines with [[Harvard University|Harvard]], configuring the [[PDP-1]] to make free calls, [[war dialing]] and accumulating large phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://infostory.com/2011/11/20/hacking-and-blue-boxes/ |title=Hacking and Blue Boxes &amp;#124; The Story of Information |website=Infostory.com |date=2011-11-20 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gustavo Duarte |url=http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/first-recorded-usage-of-hacker/ |title=First Recorded Usage of "Hacker" - Gustavo Duarte |website=Duartes.org |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V83/PDF/V83-N24.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314083748/http://tech.mit.edu/V83/PDF/V83-N24.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===1965===
* William D. Mathews from [[MIT]] found a vulnerability in a '''[[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]]''' running on an [[IBM 7094]]. The standard text editor on the system was designed to be used by one user at a time, working in one directory, and so created a temporary file with a constant name for all instantiations of the editor. The flaw was discovered when two system programmers were editing at the same time and the temporary files for the message-of-the day and the password file became swapped, causing the contents of the system CTSS password file to display to any user logging into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/turing91/ |title=untitled1.html |website=Larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001 |date=1940-11-07 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415141955/http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257 |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257|title=23257 : IBM 7094 CTSS System Text Editor Multiple Instance Password File Disclosure|website=Archive.fo|accessdate=2017-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20130415141955/http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257|archivedate=2013-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/ |title=The World's First Computer Password?

===1967===

* The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM's [[APL (programming language)|APL]] network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through [[Science Research Associates]]) approached [[Evanston Township High School]] with the offer of four [[IBM 2741|2741 Selectric teletypewriter]] based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language.  The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:   “Science Research Associates undertook to write a full APL system for the [[IBM 1500]]. They modeled their system after [[APL\360|APL/360]], which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible. In their documentation they acknowledge their gratitude to “a number of high school students for their compulsion to bomb the system.” 30 This was an early example of a kind of sportive, but very effective, debugging that was often repeated in the evolution of APL systems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falkoff|first=A.

==1970s==
===1971===
* [[John Draper|John T. Draper]] (later nicknamed Captain Crunch), his friend [[Joybubbles|Joe Engressia]], and [[blue box]] [[phone phreaking]] hit the news with an ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'' feature story.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;David Price: [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06302008.html Blind Whistling Phreaks and the FBI's Historical Reliance on Phone Tap Criminality] [[CounterPunch]], June 30, 2008  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701125121/http://www.counterpunch.org/price06302008.html |date=July 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_spectator/2011/10/the_article_that_inspired_steve_jobs_secrets_of_the_little_blue_.html |title=The article that inspired Steve Jobs: "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" |website=Slate.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979===
* [[Kevin Mitnick]] breaks into his first major computer system, the Ark, the computer system [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) used for developing their [[RSTS/E]] operating system software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thememoryhole.org/lit/deception-ch1.htm |title=The Memory Hole &gt; The Missing Chapter from The Art of Deception by Kevin Mitnick |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317050834/http://www.thememoryhole.org/lit/deception-ch1.htm |archivedate=2009-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==

===1980===
* The [[FBI]] investigates a breach of security at [[National CSS]] (NCSS). ''[[The New York Times]]'', reporting on the incident in 1981, describes hackers as&lt;ref name="mclellan19810726"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/business/case-of-the-purloined-password.html?pagewanted=3&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Case of the Purloined Password | work=The New York Times | date=1981-07-26 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=McLellan, Vin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{quote|technical experts; skilled, often young, computer programmers, who almost whimsically probe the defenses of a computer system, searching out the limits and the possibilities of the machine. Despite their seemingly subversive role, hackers are a recognized asset in the computer industry, often highly prized}}

:The newspaper describes [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]] activities as part of a "mischievous but perversely positive 'hacker' tradition". When a National CSS employee revealed the existence of his [[password cracker]], which he had used on customer accounts, the company chastised him not for writing the software but for not disclosing it sooner. The letter of reprimand stated that "The Company realizes the benefit to NCSS and in fact encourages the efforts of employees to identify security weaknesses to the VP, the directory, and other sensitive software in files".{{r|mclellan19810726}}

===1981===
* [[Chaos Computer Club]] forms in Germany.
* Ian Murphy aka Captain Zap, was the first cracker to be tried and convicted as a felon. Murphy broke into AT&amp;T's computers in 1981 and changed the internal clocks that metered billing rates. People were getting late-night discount rates when they called at midday. Of course, the bargain-seekers who waited until midnight to call long distance were hit with high bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/02/41630?currentPage=all|title=The Greatest Hacks of All Time|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[The 414s]] break into 60 computer systems at institutions ranging from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to Manhattan's [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]].&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|page=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident appeared as the cover story of [[Newsweek]] with the title "Beware: Hackers at play".&lt;ref name = "iophas"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=Newsweek|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on computer security and passed several laws.
* The group [[P.H.I.R.M.|KILOBAUD]] is formed in February, kicking off a series of other hacker groups which form soon after.
* The movie ''[[WarGames]]'' introduces the wider public to the phenomenon of hacking and creates a degree of mass paranoia of hackers and their supposed abilities to bring the world to a screeching halt by launching nuclear [[ICBM]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016|Reference List=17.

* In his [[Turing Award]] lecture, [[Ken Thompson]] mentions "hacking" and describes a security exploit that he calls a "[[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Ken|last=Thompson|title=Reflections on Trusting Trust|booktitle=1983 Turing Award Lecture|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|date=October 1983|url=http://www.acm.org/awards/article/a1983-thompson.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984===
* Someone calling himself [[Lex Luthor]] founds the [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]]. Named after a Saturday morning cartoon, the LOD had the reputation of attracting "the best of the best"—until one of the most talented members called [[Phiber Optik]] feuded with Legion of Doomer [[Erik Bloodaxe (hacker)|Erik Bloodaxe]] and got 'tossed out of the clubhouse'. Phiber's friends formed a rival group, the [[Masters of Deception]].
* The [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act]] gives the Secret Service jurisdiction over [[computer fraud]].
* [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] forms in [[Lubbock, Texas]], and begins publishing its [[underground ezine|ezine]].
* The [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] magazine ''2600'' begins regular publication, right when [[Technical Assistance Program|TAP]] was putting out its final issue.  The editor of ''2600'', "[[Emmanuel Goldstein]]" (whose real name is [[Eric Corley]]), takes his handle from the leader of the resistance in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''. The publication provides tips for would-be hackers and phone phreaks, as well as commentary on the hacker issues of the day. Today, copies of ''2600'' are sold at most large retail bookstores.
* The [[Chaos Communication Congress]], the annual European hacker conference organized by the [[Chaos Computer Club]], is held in [[Hamburg]], Germany.
* [[William Gibson]]'s groundbreaking science fiction novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', about "Case", a futuristic computer hacker, is published.  Considered the first major [[cyberpunk]] novel, it brought into hacker jargon such terms as "[[cyberspace]]", "the matrix", "simstim", and "[[Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics|ICE]]".

===1985===
* [[P.H.I.R.M.|KILOBAUD]] is re-organized into The [[P.H.I.R.M.]], and begins [[sysop]]ping hundreds of [[Bulletin board system|BBSs]] throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.
* The online 'zine ''[[Phrack]]'' is established.
* ''[[The Hacker's Handbook]]'' is published in the UK.{{citation needed|reason=Is apparently '86?|date=May 2017}}
* The FBI, Secret Service, Middlesex County NJ Prosecutor's Office and various local law enforcement agencies execute seven search warrants concurrently across New Jersey on July 12, 1985, seizing equipment from BBS operators and users alike for "complicity in computer theft",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/34933732/2600-The-Hacker-Quarterly-Volume-2-Number-8-August-1985 |title=2600: The Hacker Quarterly (Volume 2, Number 8, August 1985) &amp;#124; United States Postal Service &amp;#124; Telephone Tapping |website=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a newly passed, and yet untested criminal statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nj-statute-info.com/getStatute.php?statute_id=1618 |title=New Jersey Statute Directory - NJSA 2C:20-25 Computer criminal activity; degree of crime; sentencing |website=Nj-statute-info.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is famously known as the Private Sector Bust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofhacking.com/tucops/etc/law/live/aoh_psbust.htm |title=TUCoPS :: Cyber Law :: psbust.txt |website=Artofhacking.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the 2600 BBS Seizure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2600.wrepp.com/2600/article.php?i=128&amp;a=1777 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005909/http://2600.wrepp.com/2600/article.php?i=128&amp;a=1777 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and implicated the Private Sector BBS sysop, Store Manager (also a BBS sysop), Beowulf, Red Barchetta, The Vampire, the NJ Hack Shack BBS sysop, and the Treasure Chest BBS sysop.

===1986===
* After more and more break-ins to [[government]] and [[corporation|corporate]] computers, Congress passes the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], which makes it a crime to break into computer systems. The law, however, does not cover juveniles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=CFAA article does not mention juvenile exception}}

{{Maya civilization}}
A unique and intricate style, the tradition of '''Mayan architecture''' spans several thousands of years. Often, the buildings most dramatic and easily recognizable as Mayans are the stepped  pyramids of the
[[Terminal Pre-classic]] period and beyond. Being based on the general [[Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerican architectural]] traditions, these pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stairstep design. Each pyramid was dedicated to a deity whose shrine sat at its top. During this "height" of Maya culture, the centers of their religious, commercial and bureaucratic power grew into large cities, namely [[Tikal]] and [[Uxmal]]. Through observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elan.com.mx/biblioteca/Function%20and%20Meaning%20in%20Classic%20Maya%20Architecture.pdf#page=56]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban design==
{{see also|Maya city}}

As Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of [[Mesoamerica]], the extent of site planning appears to have been minimal; their cities having been built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. Maya architecture tends to integrate a great degree of natural features. For instance, some cities existing on the flat [[limestone]] plains of the northern Yucatán grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of [[Usumacinta]] utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed.
At the onset of large-scale construction, a predetermined axis was typically established in congruence with the cardinal directions. Depending upon the location and availability of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or ''[[cenotes]]'', the city grew by connecting great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings, by means of ''[[sacbeob]]'' causeways. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasts sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as [[Teotihuacan]] and its rigid grid-like construction.

[[File:Temples of the Cross Group.jpg|thumb|left|Palenque, [[Temple of the Cross Complex]]]]
At the heart of the Maya city existed the large plazas surrounded by their most valued governmental and religious buildings such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples, and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]]. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Immediately outside this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines: the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people.

[[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. In this case, the open public plazas were the gathering places for the people and the focus of the urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic.

==Building process==
All evidence seems to suggest that most stone buildings existed on top of a platform sub-structure that varied in height from less than a meter, in the case of terraces and smaller structures, to 45 meters in the case of great temples and pyramids. A flight of often steep stone steps split the large stepped platforms on at least one side, contributing to the common bi-symmetrical appearance of Maya architecture. Depending on the prevalent stylistic tendencies of an area, these platforms most often were built of a stucco and cut stone exterior filled with densely packed gravel. As is the case with many other Maya reliefs, those on the platforms often were related to the intended purpose of the residing structure. Thus, as the sub-structural platforms were completed, the grand residences and temples of the Maya were constructed on the solid foundations of the platforms. As all structures were built, little attention seems to have been given to their utilitarian functionality and much to external aesthetics; however, a certain repeated aspect, the [[corbeled arch]], was often utilized to mimic the appearance and feel of the simple Maya hut. Though not an effective tool to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a [[corbelled vault]], to construct what the Maya referred to as ''[[pibnal]]'', or [[sweatbath]], such as those in the [[Temple of the Cross]] at Palenque. As structures were completed, typically extensive relief work was added, often to the covering of stucco used to smooth any imperfections; however, many [[lintel]] carvings have been discovered, as well as actual stone carvings used as a facade. Commonly, these would continue uninterrupted around an entire structure and contain a variety of artwork pertaining to the inhabitants or purpose of a building. Though not the case in all Maya locations, broad use of painted stucco has been discovered as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the [[Maya calendar|Maya Long Count Calendar]], every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Building Materials                                                                                                                                                                                '''

The Mayan civilization used very simple tools for building their structures.  The most common tools use were made of stone found in surrounding areas.  Limestone was a huge part of the Mayan tool making, as limestone was geographically very abundant in most settlements.  Locations of the Mayan cities were chosen with the access to necessary stones in mind.  This allowed most quarries to be right outside the city for easy access to blocks needed for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courses.psu.edu/anth/anth008_cmg149/mbm.html|title=Mayan construction:  building materials|last=Moore|first=Christina|website=www.courses.psu.edu|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Top Limestone quarries used were Palenque and Tikal.  Though Limestone was the most important material they still collected sandstone from Quiriguá and volcanic tuff from Copan. 

The Mayan people had taken advantage of mortar on most structural projects.  The Mayans used a very difficult process of limestone under large amounts of heat to create their mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Architecture/|title=Maya Architecture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mortar was so widely used, the Mayans even used it for sculptures, facades, and floor layers.  Their mortar was very effective on a large building lifetime, but humid climates can have a negative effect on the mortar. 

For more important construction projects the Mayans would cover the entire structures exterior with stucco, followed by bright paintings, prioritizing red, yellow, green, and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mayansandtikal.com/mayan-architecture/mayan-buildings-daily-life-or-architecture/#Mayan_Building_Materials|title=Mayan Buildings|website=mayansandtikal.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable constructions==

===Ceremonial platforms===
These were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps ''[[tzompantli]]'', a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] opponents.

===Palaces===
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite. Every exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs. At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the North Acropolis at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the Terminal Pre-classic and Early Classic periods.[[File:Sayil Palacio Plan EN.png|thumb|left|Sayil, Yucatán. Three-story palace.]][[File:Palenque - El Palacio - Rekonstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|Palenque, Palace]]

===E-groups===
"[[E-Group]]" is a classification given by [[Mayanist]]s to certain structure complexes present at a number of Maya sites located in the central and southern Maya lowlands (e.g., the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]]). Complexes of this type consist of a stepped pyramid main structure, situated on the western side of a quadrilateral plaza or platform. A raised but rather elongated structure appears along the eastern side of the plaza, running north-south; a variation has three smaller temple mounds on top of or replacing this platform, the middle of these substructures placed directly opposite the main structure. Often, two other subsidiary structures appear on the north and south sides of the plaza, respectively. The main western structure is typically terraced (i.e. has several levels), with inset stairways on each of its four sides, with only the eastern stairway, leading from the plaza, providing access to the summit. The stairways have large balustrades which protrude from the pyramid, which were decorated with large [[stucco]] masks and panels of architectural art. In other examples, believed to be of a later date, this quadripartite stairway configuration is lacking.

E-group complexes are named after their prototypical example, Structure E-VII-sub at the site of [[Uaxactun]]. They were first identified as a meaningful complex by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] in 1924, who excavated the site under the auspices of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution of Washington]].

It has been theorized that these E-groups are observatories, because the eponymous group at Uaxactun contains alignments corresponding approximately to sunrises on the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. However, all other E-groups have different orientations, which pertain to widespread groups of astronomical alignments that are also embedded in a number of buildings of other types; hence the term "observatory" applied to these assemblages is hardly warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomy and architecture in the Maya lowlands |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=189-215 |doi=10.1558/jsa.30050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ideas seem to stem from the possible creation story told by the relief and artwork that adorns these structures.

===Triadic Groups===
They consist of an elevated platform (either an extensive acropolis or a steep pyramid) with a monumental stairway, with a central building facing the stairs, and two lateral structures facing each other on both sides of the platform. This formal complex has been attributed to the earthly re-creation of the Celestial Hearth (modern-day constellation of Orion), or a stage for enthronement rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Triadic Groups have been interpreted as sanctuaries commemorating Maize God's resurrection upon the Flowery Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes appear during the Late Preclassic times and gradually decrease in number until their disappearance in the Early Postclassic.

===Pyramids and temples===
Often the most important temples sat atop towering Maya pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]]. The sanctuary on top commonly was heightened by a crest or roof comb. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. [[Image:Tikal6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tikal]], temple pyramid with prominent roof comb]]

At Chichén Itzá there is a pyramid called [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] ('the castle'). With four stairways, each with 91 steps (with the upper platform they sum up to 365), and having other architectural elements appearing in astronomically significant numbers, it is a good example of Maya myth and astronomical cycles joined in architecture. Also referred to as the Pyramid of Kukulcán, the structure provides a remarkable display, observed by thousands of modern visitors at the equinoxes. The setting sun's rays are projected on the northern balustrade, create the illusion of a snake winding its way down the steps of the pyramid. The snake is composed of several triangle shapes giving it the appearance of a diamond back snake. At the base of the northern stairway there are massive snake head sculptures, making this effect even more persuasive. While it is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/HTML/castillo.html|title=Ancient Observatories: Chichén Itzá|author=|date=|website=www.exploratorium.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/chichen-itza|title=Chichen Itza -- World Heritage Site -- National Geographic|author=|date=15 November 2010|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya architecture is vastly different from the others in Meso-American cultures. The blend of mythology and astronomical events can be found in nearly all Maya palace or pyramid structures. One will also notice the heavy influence of the Toltecs in the architecture at Chichén Itzá. The Toltecs invaded the Maya and merged their cultural traditions around the year 1000.&lt;ref name="ancient.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|title=Chichen Itza|author=|date=|website=ancient.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114073941/https://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observatories===
The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the [[Sun]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]]. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to [[Kukulcan]], are perhaps those most often described as "observatories" by modern ruin tour-guides. It is now known, however, that many buildings of different types and uses were oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on specific dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates recorded are concentrated in four agriculturally significant seasons and tend to be separated by multiples of elementary periods of the calendrical system (13 and 20 days), suggesting that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and associated ceremonial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454_Orientaciones_astronomicas_en_la_arquitectura_maya_de_las_tierras_bajas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the important Maya buildings were oriented on the basis of astronomical criteria, their primary functions were religious, residential or administrative; the label "observatory" applied to any structural type is thus hardly warranted.

===Ballcourts===
As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ballgame were constructed throughout the Maya realm, often on a grand scale. The playing alleys of ballcourts were defined by two long walls.  Courts built earlier in Maya history (as at [[Cobá]]) had sloped sides, while ones built later (as at [[Chichén Itzá]]) had vertical sides. Frequently, the ends were enclosed so as to create an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shaped court when viewed from above.[[Image:Chichen itza ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza]]

When the Maya played games in the Ballcourts, the ball was made of solid rubber and was sometimes as much as a foot in diameter. It was passed between teams ranged on opposite ends of the court. The players could hit it only with their knees or hips, much like football or soccer today. Points could be scored when the opponents failed to return the ball correctly. In central Mexico, and in late times in Yucatán, rings of stone were set high up in the side walls of the court. It was considered a particular triumph for a player to knock the ball through the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff, Tatiana. (2002). An Album of Maya Architecture. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cave sites==
There are also [[cave]] sites that are important to the Maya. [[Maya cave sites]] include [[Jolja Cave]], the cave site at [[Naj Tunich]], the [[Candelaria Caves]], and the [[Cave of the Witch]]. There are also cave [[creation myth]]s among the Maya. Some cave sites are still used by the modern Maya in the [[Chiapas highlands]] in Mexico.

'''MegaTransect''' was the name for a project conducted in Africa in 1999 by [[J. Michael Fay]] to spend 455 days on the expedition hike of 2000 miles across the [[Congo Basin]] of [[Africa]] to survey the ecological and environmental status of the region.

A transect is a term in ecology that denotes a survey of the natural vegetation through a particular area. The concept of a megatransect was conceived as a vegetation transect on a large scale that could be used to take an ecological census of the natural vegetation and ecosystems.

Shortly after the hike, Fay successfully lobbied alongside the President of [[Gabon]] to create 13 new [[national park]]s.  In 2002, US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and other Bush Administration members gave 53 million dollars to help preserve the Congo Basin.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Mike Fay later went on to carry out the [[MegaFlyover]] in 2004.

==[[Madagascar]] megatransect==

Also in 2004, an international team conducted a "Megatransect" of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Dubbed "Hike Madagascar", the journey covered the entire island.  Members met with rural farmers to help them improve their agricultural techniques and discuss their impact on the environment.

==History of USA megatransects==
One of the first megatransects in the [[United States]], was conducted by Dr. Robert R. Humphrey when he rephotographed 535 miles of the natural vegetation along the United States and Mexico border at the 1890s permanent border monument locations, spaced about five miles apart, and published the work in "90 Years and 535 miles: Vegetation Changes along the Mexican Border" (1987, pub. Univ. of NM Press, 448 pages).

Craig C. Dremann, in 1997, conducted a megatransect surveying over 3,000 miles and at each mile-marker, noting the roadside vegetation, the perennial native [[grass]], and [[Invasive species|exotic grass]] status, through the [[Great Basin]] ecosystem.  The route was from [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada eastward to [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], South Dakota, and from South Dakota, through Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and returning westward to [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], California, and then north to Reno.

In 2005, Dremann conducted another vegetation megatransect, this time of the California portion of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave desert]], mapping over 1,000 miles on a mile-by-mile basis, for a fast-spreading exotic [[Mustard plant|mustard]] species, [[Brassica]] [[Brassica tournefortii|tournefortii]], noting the locations and density of the [[Mojave desert Mustard infestation in California]].

Dremann suggests that a method of remotely conducting a large-scale vegetation megatransect, is with photographs. Photographs that have been taken at ground-level at intervals from known locations, can be stitched together, to create large-scale to Continent-scale megatransect pictures of the ecosystems.

In 2006, Dr. Michael C. McGrann, and his wife Amy M. McGrann, hiked the length of the California section of Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) in the western United States from Mexico to the Oregon border (2,736&amp;nbsp;km) while systematically collecting avian-habitat data on 3,578 survey plots separated by 10-minute hiking intervals. This work was completed in a single field season from 2 April to 8 September. From this data, Dr. McGrann and his collaborators described the elevation and latitudinal distributions of birds along the PCT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistically modeled avian species richness relationships with elevation, climate, and environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Tingley|first2=Morgan|last3=Elliott-Fisk|first3=Deborah|last4=Thorne|first4=James|last5=McGrann|first5=Amy|title=Heterogeneity in avian richness-environment relationships along the Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Avian Conservation and Ecology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=2|page=8|url=http://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss2/art8/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from this work show that birds can exhibit heterogeneous relationships to temperature, precipitation, and productivity, depending on the distinct environmental and climate conditions of each of the ecological regions traversed by the PCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrann|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=James|title=Elevational ranges of birds along California's Pacific Crest Trail|journal=Western Birds|date=2014|volume=45|pages=18–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCT Mega-transect is an ongoing research project for Dr. McGrann in collaboration with several other researchers. He has continued his biodiversity surveys along sections of the PCT in 2007, 2010, and 2015, and he is working to expand taxa surveyed along the PCT and to involve his undergraduate students at William Jessup University in the [http://www.jessup.edu/academics/environmental-science/#tab_research PCT Mega-Transect].

In 2007-2008 J. Michael Fay and Lindsey Holm completed a 1300 mile [http://www.redwoodtransect.org Redwood Transect] of 333 days.  This was a transect that spanned from the southernmost to the northernmost redwood tree in California and Oregon.  They walked extensively on private timberland and public land recording data on historical exploitation, current forest stand characteristics, silviculture and many other aspects of the redwood ecosystem.  The results will be published in National Geographic in 2009.

The [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] and the [[National Park Service]] are adapting the idea of a megatransect for the [[Appalachian Trail]] (A.T.) Like other megatransects, the [http://www.appalachiantrail.org/megatransect A.T. MEGA-Transect] aims to monitor the natural resources along the trail, understand the status and trends of these resources, and inform and engage the public and stakeholders. The 2,178 mile long trail crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine, and is visited by one to two million people, and completed by about 400 people each year. Volunteer citizen scientists are beginning to implement monitoring protocols to track natural resources such as wildlife presence, water quality, forest health, invasive plants, endangered species, mountain birds, phenology, and air quality. Professional scientists are also using the transect for independent research. Because the A.T. is oriented along the predicted migratory direction of species responding to climate change, it is a particularly important megatransect to establish and maintain.

==MegaTransect future==
For a rapidly changing planet, megatransects establish baseline [[data]] from which to draw future trends, and they can focus attention on particular ecosystems which are disappearing faster than others.

Establishing standard megatransects on specific [[region]]s or through various ecosystems of each continent, and periodic re&amp;ndash;measurement of the ecological conditions along routes, every five to ten years, would provide very valuable measured data on environmental trends.

[[File:Pupitre bois.jpg|thumb|200px|A heavy wooden music stand. This stand is designed for use in a private home or teaching studio. Its weight and fine finish make it unsuitable for daily transportation to rehearsals and gigs.]]
A '''music stand''' is a pedestal or elevated rack designed to hold a paper score or [[sheet music|sheets of music]] in position for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music stand|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/music-stand|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/music%20stand &lt;/ref&gt; Most music stands for [[orchestra]]l, [[chamber music]] or solo orchestra-family instruments (violin, oboe, trumpet, etc.) can be raised or lowered to accommodate seated or standing performers, or performers of different heights. Many types of keyboard instruments have a built-in or removable music rack or stand where sheet music can be placed. Music stands enable musicians to read sheet music or scores while playing an instrument or conducting, as the stand leaves the hands free. Music stands are sometimes used by singers, however for [[choir]]s, singers typically hold their sheet music in a folder, and singers performing solo recitals or [[opera]] performances typically memorize the lyrics and melodies. Some singers use stands, such as lounge singers and wedding vocalists who have a repertoire of hundreds of songs, which makes remembering all of the verses difficult.

==Types==
[[File:Abant Cuartet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A vocal group using music stands.]]
There are various types of music stands for different purposes and intended users. Folding stands collapse, which makes them convenient to take to rehearsals and performances out of the home. Folding stands are typically used by amateur musicians at rehearsals and performances. Professional musicians are more likely to limit their use of folding stands to rehearsals held outside of normal performance venues (e.g., a [[chamber music]] rehearsal at a private home) or small gigs. Non-folding stands tend to be used by professional orchestras and [[big band]]s for rehearsals and concerts.
===Folding===
====Lightweight====
[[File:Music stand metal folded.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A folding music stand in its collapsed position, ready for transportation.]]
Folding stands range from inexpensive, lightweight models made of metal, which are designed to hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal folding stands often have solid wire extensions or metal "arms" which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in [[youth orchestra]]s. Lightweight folding stands are designed to collapsible; if folding stands did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for [[rehearsal]]s, [[audition]]s and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring folding stands to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non-folding stands.

Lightweight stands are not designed to support heavy books of music such as full-size [[fake book]]s; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. Folding stands consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for supporting the rack, with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).

The portability of lightweight music stands can lead to some problems. Heavy fake books or full scores may overload the stand, leading to it falling over when a performer turns a page. As well, when a lightweight stand is used with its column fully extended, as by a standing orchestral timpanist or double bass player, a heavy part may be "tippy" on the over-extended column. Oversized parts, which are used in some [[contemporary classical music]], may be too wide to be supported by the stand; a solution that some musicians use is to use multiple stands for oversize parts. As well, during outdoor performances, such as playing at a wedding, picnic or a [[bandstand]], lightweight stands may be blown over by wind, which can interrupt a performance or even, if the stand strikes an instrument, damage the finish of an instrument.

====Heavy duty====
Heavy duty folding models typically use a hollow cylindrical column as the main support and three cylindrical columns arrayed in a tripod to ensure the stand stays upright. Heavy duty stands can reliably support a thick, several hundred page [[fake book]], [[song book]] or a binder full of songs. The height of the column can be raised or lowered to permit the stand to be used for a seated performer (common for most orchestral instruments, except for percussion and sometimes double bass) or a standing performer.

===Non-folding===
[[File:2012-05-20 Musicians leaving a wedding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Musicians leaving a wedding performance carry non-folding music stands.]]
Professional [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s and [[big band]]s typically use non-portable, non-folding heavy-duty stands. The stands are typically coloured or painted black so that the stands blend in with the black clothing of the musicians and are not distracting. The music holding portion of the stand may be plastic or metal, and in both cases, the music holding portion is supported by a metal column. The part supporting the music often has a shelf below it for pencils, [[rosin]] (for string players), and other rehearsal accessories. The metal column can be raised or lowered to put the stand at the desired height. Professional stands can be lowered to be used for a seated performer or raised for standing performers. Some non-folding stands have perforations in the music rack to reduce the weight of the stand, an especially important consideration when a large number of stands are being moved.

These stands do not fold or collapse (apart from the ability to lower the height of the stand) and are thus rarely used by musicians travelling alone or one-by-one to rehearsals or gigs. The stands can be moved, but for a full orchestra to move its 50-100 stands, which are often loaded onto a heavy rack, a moving truck and movers need to be hired to relocate the stands. Professional stands either have some type of tripod-style or quadruped-style base, or they have a heavy, metal base, often circular.
[[File:2016 Stojak na nuty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An expensive antique music stand.]]
Some musicians use non-folding, professional stands for all of their rehearsals and gigs, even though this may require them to take more trips to load their gear into the hall. The reason some musicians choose to use non-folding stands is because they are more stable, even with heavy parts or scores, they are more resistant to falling over during outdoor shows, and they look more professional. As well, some performers like to have access to a shelf underneath their stand, to obtain music accessories that are needed throughout a rehearsal or show (e.g., pencils, rosin for string players, picks for guitar players, reeds for reed players, valve oil for brass players, a tuning key for percussionists, etc.)

Musicians may also have expensive non-folding stands in their homes or music studios made of wood or metal. These stands are not designs that are meant to be relocated. Due to their weight and/or their delicate finishes, they are intended to be used in a single location, such as a private home. Some heavy stands are made of carved wood and feature [[bas relief]] carvings and inlay work. Other heavy stands are made of brass, and feature musical motifs such as [[treble clef]]s. Some of these heavy stands are objects of art in their own right.

===Digital===
[[Digital data|Digital]] music stands that use a computer screen to display the music began being used in the 1990s and 2000s. The digital "pages" can be turned by pressing an electronic footpedal, thus enabling performers to play [[chamber music]] or solo pieces with difficult page turns without hiring or finding a volunteer to act as a page turner. The music notation is typically displayed on a [[flatscreen display]] or a [[tablet computer]] screen.
===Marching band===
[[File:Trumpet's lectern.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A marching band "clip" for a [[trumpet]] player.]]
[[Marching band]] or some [[brass band]] members use a small sheet holder called a '''lyre''' or a '''clip''' which, can be attached to an instrument. The clip holds a smaller-sized part for the performer, so she/he can read the music while marching.

===Conducting===
[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|right|A large, heavy conductor's stand.]]
Large, heavy duty music stands are available for [[Conducting|conductors]] of [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s, [[choir]]s and [[big band]]s to hold their heavy, over-size scores of music. These stands are typically not designed to be easily transportable, and they are usually intended for installation in a rehearsal hall or concert hall. Conductor's stands have to be able to be angled much flatter than an instrumentalist's stand, because the conductor reads from a large [[full score|full-score]], which contains the parts for all of the instruments. For some [[symphony|symphonies]], the score can be both thick and heavy; to ensure that the stand is stable, a conducting stand needs to have a heavy, wide base and a sturdy platform for the score. As with professional instrumentalist stands, some conducting stands have a narrow shelf where a conductor can store her [[baton (music)|batons]], [[handkerchief]]s, [[reading glasses]], and, for rehearsals, a small [[metronome]].

===Keyboard instruments===
[[Upright piano]]s, [[grand piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[harpsichord]]s, [[pipe organ]]s, [[Hammond organ]]s and many post-1980s [[electronic keyboard]]s have some type of rack or stand to hold sheet music and/or scores. On some grand pianos, the music stand can be removed, for example, if the performer is playing a piano solo work or a [[piano concerto]] from memory. On some electronic or electric keyboards, the stand can be removed, to facilitate transportation of the instrument to rehearsals and gigs. If the music stands on electronic and electric keyboards were permanently affixed, they would make the instrument harder to load into a van or car, and the stand would be vulnerable to damage. 
[[File:KORG LP350 with music scores on music stand (photozou 43110250) by Ludwig D. Omen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Korg LP350 electronic keyboard with a music stand on the top of the instrument.]]
On some [[digital piano]]s designed for use in a private home or studio, the music rack is permanently installed, but most users of digital pianos do not transport them to rehearsals and gigs, because these instruments often have a number of design features that are not conducive to regular transport (e.g., fixed keyboard legs and a [[modesty panel]] and fixed pedals for sustain and sostenuto). Most keyboardists who are regularly transporting electronic keyboards to rehearsals and gigs use [[stage piano]]s or [[MIDI controller]] keyboards along with a [[sound module]]; on these instruments, all of the accessories (music rack, keyboard stand, sustain pedal) can be disconnected. By enabling the keyboard to be broken down into separate components, it makes the instrument more transportable in a regular car, even including small vehicles. In contrast, a high-end digital piano with a fixed music rack, stand and pedals would need a van and several helpers to transport it.

===Tabletop===
[[File:Music stand table.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A table top stand.]]
While the vast majority of music stands are designed to provide their own support for raising the music rack to the desired height, there are some music racks which are designed for placing on a table or counter. Since a table or counter must be used, this makes these racks unsuitable for instruments such as timpani.

==Challenges==
With outdoor performances, users of music stands can face challenges due to wind blowing the pages of sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal clips or clothes pins on the sides of the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight folding stand may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base.

In opera, ballet and musical theatre, the orchestra (or band in the case of musicals) often plays in an [[orchestra pit]] in front of and at a lower level than the main performance stage. For dramatic reasons, the stage may be darkened at times during the performance, and the [[house lights]] turned off. This darkness could pose challenges for the musicians who are reading parts or chord charts in the pit. To resolve this challenge, small stand lights are clipped onto the tops of stands. To avoid having the stand lights distract audience members, some venues have cloth "hoods" over the lights. Originally, stand lights were incandescent, requiring extension cords running throughout the pit and regular bulb changes. In the 2000s, as [[LED]] lights became more affordable, battery powered LED lights have become widely used. LED lights do not need extension cords and the bulbs almost never need replacement. Stand lights do not clip as securely to thin folding stands. Stand lights clip more securely onto the solid rack of a professional, non-folding stand. A Canadian viola player invented a stand with a built-in LED light, for dark performing settings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottawalife.com/article/visionary-music-stand-puts-ottawa-at-the-forefront-of-innovation &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with music desk==
The term ''stand'', as it is used to describe furniture such as a plant stand or music stand, generally implies a relatively small surface area supported at the required height, most usually by a turned leg or support known as a ''standard''. Any inclined surface that can be used for supporting music may be thought of a music stand, although generally this function is divided between two types of furniture: a music stand proper and a music desk. The music stand, as the name suggests, consists of a support for the music raised upon a freestanding column or tripod, which, in addition to being movable may also be adjustable with regard to its height and the angle at which it may be tilted. A music [[desk]] generally implies a similar, tiltable support for the music, but rather than being raised on a stand, instead forms part of a table. In as much as the term "desk" originally implied a sloping-topped table for reading or writing, the slight adjustment necessary to turn a desk into a music desk was a relatively simple matter.

[[File:Bachlut1.gif|thumb|250px|Hand-written musical notation by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). This is the beginning of the ''Prelude from the Suite for Lute in G minor'' BWV 995 (transcription of ''Cello Suite No. 5'', BWV 1011).]]
'''Music notation''' or '''musical notation''' is any system used to visually represent [[wikt:aurally|aurally]] perceived [[music]] played with [[instrument (music)|instruments]] or [[singing|sung]] by the [[human voice]] through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols.

Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional [[classical music]] performers, [[sheet music]] using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s, the [[Nashville Number System]] is the main method.

The symbols used include ancient symbols and [[modern musical symbols|modern symbols]] made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone, made in [[clay tablet]]s, made using a pen on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] or [[manuscript paper]]; printed using a [[printing press]] (ca. 1400s), a [[computer printer]] (ca. 1980s) or other [[Music engraving|printing]] or [[Photocopier|modern copying technology]].

Although many ancient cultures used symbols to represent [[melody|melodies]] and [[rhythm]]s, none of them were particularly comprehensive, and this has limited today's understanding of their music. The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in [[Medieval music|medieval]] Europe, starting with the [[Catholic church|Catholic Church]]'s goal for ecclesiastical uniformity.  The church began notating [[plainchant]] melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church. Music notation developed further in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]] eras. In the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] (1750–1820) and the [[Romantic music era]] (1820–1900), notation continued to develop as new [[music technology (mechanical)|musical instrument technologies]] were developed. In the [[contemporary classical music]] of the 20th and 21st century, music notation has continued to develop, with the introduction of [[graphical notation (music)|graphical notation]] by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based [[scorewriter|score writer]] programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, [[popular music]], and [[traditional music]].

==History==

===Ancient Near East===
{{further|Music of Mesopotamia|Hurrian songs}}
[[File:Hurritische hymne.gif|right|frame|A drawing of one side of the tablet on which the Hymn to Nikkal is inscribed&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati, "[http://128.97.6.202/urkeshpublic/music.htm Hurrian Music]", associate editor and webmaster Federico A. Buccellati Urkesh website (n.p.: IIMAS, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]), in about 1400 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer &amp; Civil 1986,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer 1965,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994a"&gt;West 1994, 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994b"&gt;West 1994, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|250px|A photograph of the original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols ''above'' the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.]]

===Ancient Greece===
{{further|Musical system of ancient Greece}}

[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

Three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. The [[Delphic Hymns]], dated to the 2nd century BC, also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{further|Byzantine music}}
[[File:Stavropoleos-anastasimatar-macarie-viena-1823-p11.png|thumb|right|250px|Byzantine music notation style in a Romanian ''anastasimatarion'', a "Book of Hymns at the Lord's Resurrection", 1823]]

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] music has mainly survived as music for court ceremonies, including vocal religious music. It is not known if it is based on the [[monody|monodic]] [[Musical mode#Greek scales|modal]] singing and instrumental music of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek theoretical categories played a key role to understand and transmit Byzantine music, especially the tradition of Damascus had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic [[Near East]] comparable to [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]].

Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key ([[Enechema|modal signatures]] which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the [[echos]]. Despite [[ekphonetic notation]] further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Today we can only the study the evolution of notation within Greek monastic chant books like those of the [[Sticheron|sticherarion]] and  the [[Irmologion|heirmologion]], while there is no authentic asmatikon and kontakarion of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. The earliest books which have survived, are in Slavonic translation which already show an own notation system (see [[#Russia|Russia]]) used in [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] and [[Ohrid|Macedonia]] during the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the [[Cantor (Christianity)|choirleaders]], which existed once as part of an oral tradition.

Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are ''differential'' rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant.  These step symbols themselves, or better "phonic neumes", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called ''gántzoi'' ("hooks") in [[Modern Greek]].

Notes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as an optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added, if necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another echos.

The so-called "great signs" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a [[semitone]]), both essential in Byzantine chant.&lt;ref&gt;See Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]]) for a historical discussion of the great signs and their modern interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChrysanthosTable.png|thumb|400px|center|Chrysanthos' ''Kanonion'' with a comparison between Ancient Greek tetraphonia (column 1), Western [[Solfeggio]], the ''Papadic Parallage'' (ascending: column 3 and 4; descending: column 5 and 6) according to the ''trochos system'', and his heptaphonic ''parallage'' according to the New Method (syllables in the fore-last and ''martyriai'' in the last column) ([[#Chr1832|1832, p. 33]])]]

Since [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] there are seven standard note names used for "solfège" (''parallagē'') ''pá, vú, g&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;á, d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ē, ké, zō, nē'', while the older practice still used the four enechemata or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or "kyrioi" in ascending direction, and the plagal or "plagioi" in descending direction ([[Papadic Octoechos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]]) made a difference between his monosyllabic and the traditional polysyllabic ''parallage.''&lt;/ref&gt; With exception of ''vú and zō'' they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as ''re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do''.  Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by ''Ēkhoi'', "sounds", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular ''Ēkhos'' used.  Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches.  Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and "sliding" into the natural scales from experience, but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos a lot of details are only known from an oral tradition related to traditional masters and their experience.

===13th-century Near East===
In 1252, [[Safi al-Din al-Urmawi]] developed a form of musical notation, where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toussaint|2004|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Europe===
{{Main|Neume}}

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]
The scholar and music theorist [[Isidore of Seville]], while writing in the early 7th century, considered that "unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville 2006, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a [[mnemonic]] device for [[Gregorian chant]], using symbols known as [[neume]]s; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the ''Musica disciplina'' of [[Aurelian of Réôme]], from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] before this time, of a type of notation known as [[Neume|Visigothic neumes]], but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Zapke 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--A complex issue, to be sure, but this book has 480 pages. Surely it does not take that long to demonstrate that nothing at all has been deciphered.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.

[[File:EarlyMusicNotation.JPG|250px|thumb|Early music notation]]

Notation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'', explains a set of six [[rhythmic modes]] that were in use at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 2002, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] and summarised as part of his treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (the art of measured chant, or [[mensural notation]]). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The founder of what is now considered the standard music stave was [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]],&lt;ref name="Catholic encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07065a.htm Otten 1910].&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of [[solmization]] syllables based on a hymn to [[Saint John the Baptist]], which begins [[Ut Queant Laxis]] and was written by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]]. The first stanza is:

# '''Ut''' queant laxis
# '''re'''sonare fibris,
# '''Mi'''ra gestorum
# '''fa'''muli tuorum,
# '''Sol'''ve polluti
# '''la'''bii reatum,
# '''S'''ancte '''I'''ohannes.

Guido used the first syllable of each line, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si, to read notated music in terms of [[Guidonian hand#Hexachord in Middle Ages|hexachords]]; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, Ut was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, "open" syllable Do, said to have been taken from the name of the Italian theorist [[Giovanni Battista Doni]],
but rather Do have been taken from the word "Dominus" in Latin with the meaning "the Lord". &lt;ref&gt;McNaught 1893, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, Neitz, and Battani 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1994|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern staff notation==
{{Main|List of musical symbols}}

[[File:Chopin Prelude 7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of modern musical notation: Prelude, Op. 28, No. 7, by [[Frédéric Chopin]] {{audio|Chopin Prelude 7.mid|Play}}]]

Modern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff acts as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing round [[Musical note|note]]s on the staff lines or between the lines. The pitch of the round musical notes can be modified by [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The duration (note length) is shown with different [[note value]]s, which can be indicated by the note being just a circle (a [[whole note]]) or using stems to indicate [[quarter note]]s and other subdivisions, and additional symbols such as [[dotted note|dots]] and [[Tie (music)|ties]] which lengthen the duration of a note. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult.

A staff (or stave, in British English) of written music generally begins with a [[clef]], which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The [[treble clef]] or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The [[bass clef]] or F clef shows the position of the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the [[alto clef]] (used for [[viola]] and [[alto trombone]] music) and the [[tenor clef]] (used for some [[cello]] and [[double bass]] music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using [[ledger line]]s, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use [[treble clef]] and [[double bass]] and [[tuba]], which use [[bass clef]]. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as [[piano]] and [[pipe organ]].

Following the clef, the [[key signature]] on a staff indicates the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are flat or sharp throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] added before certain notes. When a sharp is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone higher. When a flat is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone lower. [[Double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher. A double flat is placed before a note to make it two semitones lower. A [[natural sign]] placed before a note renders that note in its "natural" form, which means that any sharps or flats applying to that note from the key signature or from accidentals are cancelled. Sometimes a [[courtesy accidental]] is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch the key signature requires.

Following the key signature is the [[time signature]]. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being "4/4". The top "4" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called [[Bar (music)|bar]]). The bottom "4" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of [[beat (music)|beats]], and the time signatures specify those groupings. "4/4" is used so often that it is also called "[[common time]]", and it may be indicated with a "C" rather than numbers. Other common time signatures are "3/4" (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "2/4" (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "6/8" (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and "12/8" (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. "12/8" is a [[compound time]] type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as "3/8", "5/8", "5/4", "7/4", "9/8", and so on.

Many short [[classical music]] pieces from the [[classical period (music)|classical era]] and songs from [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the [[Romantic music]] era and later, particularly [[contemporary classical music]] and [[rock music]] genres such as [[progressive rock]] and the [[hardcore punk]] subgenre [[mathcore]], may use [[mixed meter]]; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of "5/4" and "7/8".

Directions to the player regarding matters such as [[tempo]] (e.g., [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]], [[Tempo#French tempo markings|Vif, Lent, Modérément]], [[Presto (music)|Presto]], etc.), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (pianississimo, pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo, fortississimo, etc.) appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the [[musical expression]] or "feel" to a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., "Slow March", "Fast Swing", "Medium Blues", "Fougueux", "Feierlich", "Gelassen", "Piacevole", "Con slancio", "Majestic", "Hostile" etc.) For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), [[retake]]s (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.

In music for [[musical ensemble|ensembles]], a "[[sheet music|score]]" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score while she leads an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], [[choir]] or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from  "parts" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of [[scorewriter]] computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using a computer printer. 

A [[Flat (music)|♭]] in music lowers a pitch down one semitone. A [[Sharp (music)|♯]] in music raises a note one semitone. For example, a sharp on B would raise it do B♯ while a flat would lower it to B♭.

===Variations on staff notation===
[[File:Lead-sheet-wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|A lead sheet]]
[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|250px|A chord chart. {{audio|Chord chart.mid|Play}}]]
* [[Percussion notation]] conventions are varied because of the wide range of percussion instruments. Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched (e.g., [[glockenspiel]] or [[tubular bells]]) and non-pitched (e.g., [[bass drum]] and [[snare drum]]). The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized. Pitched instruments use standard Western classical notation for the pitches and rhythms. In general, notation for unpitched percussion uses the five line staff, with different lines and spaces representing different [[drum kit]] instruments. Standard Western rhythmic notation is used to indicate the rhythm.
* [[Figured bass]] notation originated in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] parts. It is also used extensively in [[accordion]] notation. The bass notes of the music are conventionally notated, along with numbers and other signs that determine which chords the harpsichordist, organist or lutenist should improvise. It does not, however, specify the exact pitches of the harmony, leaving that for the performer to improvise.
* A [[lead sheet]] specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] placed above and lyrics below. It is used to capture the essential elements of a [[popular music|popular song]] without specifying how the song should be arranged or performed.
* A [[chord chart]] or "chart" contains little or no melodic information at all but provides detailed harmonic information about the [[chord progression]]. Some chord charts also contain rhythmic information, indicated using slash notation for full beats and rhythmic notation for rhythms. This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[List of popular music genres|popular music]] and is intended primarily for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[drum]]s).
* Simpler chord charts for songs may contain only the chord changes, placed above the lyrics where they occur. Such charts depend on prior knowledge of the melody, and are used as reminders in performance or informal [[group singing]]. Some chord charts intended for [[rhythm section]] accompanists contain only the chord progression.
* The [[shape note]] system is found in some church hymnals, [[sheet music]], and song books, especially in the [[Southern United States]]. Instead of the customary elliptical note head, note heads of various shapes are used to show the position of the note on the major scale. [[Sacred Harp]] is one of the most popular tune books using shape notes.

==In various countries==

===Korea===
[[File:시용향악보 (時用鄕樂譜).jpg|200px|thumb|''Jeongganbo musical notation system'']]
''Jeongganbo'' is a unique traditional musical notation system created during the time of [[Sejong the Great]] that was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanadesikan 2011, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gukak|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/251893/1|website=The DONG-A ILBO|publisher=dongA.com|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, Jeong-gan-bo targets a particular genre, Jeong-ak (정악, 正樂).

Jeong-gan-bo tells the pitch by writing the pitch's name down in a box called 'jeong-gan' (this is where the name comes from). One jeong-gan is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats and quarter beats, and more. This makes it easy for the reader to figure out the beat.

Also, there are lots of markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.

===India===
{{Main|Swaralipi}}
[[File:Bhat notation1.jpg|thumb|350px|Indian music, early 20th century.]]
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').

Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa).

Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

Other systems exist for non-twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] and non-Western music, such as the Indian ''[[Swaralipi]]''.

[[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|160px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]] 
Znamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]] which uses a "hook and banner" notation. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|крюки|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|знамёна|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness.{{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}} There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.

Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znamëna'' (Russian for "marks", "banners") or ''Kryuki'' ("hooks"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.

The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called "little dove" (Russian: голубчик ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese musical notation}}

[[File:Qinnotation.png|thumb|250px|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm Bagley 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609090628/http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm |date=9 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gongche notation]] used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.

===Japan===

[[File:Tempyo Biwa Fu.jpg|thumb|''Tempyō Biwa Fu'' 天平琵琶譜 (circa 738 AD), musical notation for [[Biwa]]. ([[Shōsōin]], at Nara, Japan)]]
Japanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas [[taiko]] notation focuses on discrete strokes.

[[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyuan]] [[sanshin]] music uses [[kunkunshi]], a notation system of [[kanji]] with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.

===Indonesia===&lt;!--[[Kepatihan notation]]'s see also links here--&gt;
{{Main|Gamelan notation}}

Notation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]. However, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations ("not angka" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with some subset of the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either highest note of a particular octave, as in [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]] [[gamelan]], or lowest, as in the [[kepatihan notation]] of [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]].

Notes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below the each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the [[balungan]]) and vocal parts ([[gerong]]an), although transcriptions of the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.

The symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in [[Yogyakarta]] a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of [[Gamelan gender wayang]] pieces, employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.

Composers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The Dutch composer [[Ton de Leeuw]] also invented a three line staff for his composition ''Gending''. However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scale]] cipher notation has become common for notating western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a "fixed Do" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is "moveable-Do" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, "1=C").

==Other systems and practices==

===Pitch bracket notation===
In pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket (i.e. angle bracket), determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation. Musical variations can be mathematically generated from their themes.

===Cipher notation===
{{Main|Numbered musical notation}}
Cipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the [[major scale]] degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as ''[[Siffernotskrift]]''. The one most widely in use today is the Chinese ''Jianpu'', discussed in the [[Numbered musical notation|main article]]. Numerals can of course also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese ''[[kepatihan]]'' notation [[Musical notation#Indonesia|described above]].

===Solfège===
{{Main|Solfège}}
Solfège is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do{{'}}'' (for the octave). The classic variation is: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do{{'}}''. The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by [[Guido of Arezzo]] (c. 991 &amp;ndash; after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn [[Ut queant laxis]]. The original sequence was ''Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La'', where each verse started a scale note higher. "Ut" later became "Do". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni''. See also: [[solfège]], [[swara|sargam]], [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Kodály hand signs]].

[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfège.

===Letter notation===
{{Main|Letter notation}}
The notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A–G, possibly with a trailing sharp or flat symbol, such as A{{music|sharp}} or B{{Music|flat}}.

===Tablature===
{{Main|Tablature}}
Tablature was first used in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] for organ music and later in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] for [[lute]] music.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1961, xxiii and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The [[fret]]s to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular [[guitar]] music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in [[ASCII tab|ASCII format]]. Websites like [[Tablature#OLGA.net|OLGA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olga.net/ olga.net]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have archives of text-based popular music tablature.

===Klavar notation===
{{Main|Klavarskribo}}
Klavarskribo (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.

===Piano-roll-based notations===
Some chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The "staff" is most widely referred to as "piano roll", created by extending the black and white piano keys.

===Chromatic staff notations===
Over the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a "chromatic staff" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the ''Ailler-Brennink'' notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's ''Dodeka'' music notation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodeka.info/ dodeka.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicnotation.org/systems/more-notation-systems/|title=More Notation Systems {{!}} Notation Systems {{!}} The Music Notation Project|website=musicnotation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tom Reed's ''Twinline'' notation, Russell Ambrose's ''Ambrose Piano Tabs'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambrosepianotabs.com/ ambrosepianotabs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Morris' ''Clairnote'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://clairnote.org/ clairnote.org]&lt;/ref&gt; John Keller's ''Express Stave'', and José A. Sotorrio's ''Bilinear Music Notation''. These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicnotation.org musicnotation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic notation===
{{Main|Graphic notation (music)}}
The term 'graphic notation' refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Practitioners include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], and [[Roger Reynolds]]. See ''Notations'', edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles, {{ISBN|0-685-14864-5}}.

===Simplified music notation===
{{Main|Simplified music notation}}
[[Simplified Music Notation]] is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make [[sight reading|sight-reading]] easier. It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but incorporates [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] into the shape of the [[note heads]]. [[Musical note|Note]]s such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]] are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] they are actually played at, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called ''history signs'' that show they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].

===Modified Stave Notation===
{{Main|Modified Stave Notation}}
[[Modified Stave Notation]] (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.

===Parsons code===
{{Main|Parsons code}}
Parsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.

===Braille music===
{{Main|Braille music}}
Braille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree Braille music resembles musical markup languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmarkup.info/scope/markuplanguages.html musicmarkup.info]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MusicXML]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ emusician.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701200951/http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Notation Interchange File Format|NIFF]].

===Integer notation===
In [[integer notation]], or the [[integer]] model of pitch, all [[pitch class]]es and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.

===Rap notation===
The standard form of rap notation is the "flow diagram", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath "beat numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2009, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books ''How to Rap'' and ''How to Rap 2'' extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2013, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book ''Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity''&lt;ref&gt;Krims 2001, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat,&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"&gt;Edwards 2009, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"/&gt;

==Music notation on computer==
{{Main|Scorewriter}}

Many computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called ''scorewriters'' or ''music notation software''). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.

==Perspectives of musical notation in composition and musical performance==
According to Philip Tagg and [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a 'notational centricity', a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg 1979, 28–32; Middleton 1990, 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation.{{Clarify|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--How does changing the style of notation encourage musicologists to ignore notation in favor of other approaches, such as recordings or spectrograms?--&gt; These include [[George Crumb]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Krzystof Penderecki]], [[Earle Brown|Earl Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce 1973, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan 1976, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10428">The '''National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition''' ('''NCCDC''') is the championship event for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition system – the largest college-level cyber defense competition in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The event is held annually in the San Antonio area.

In an effort to help facilitate the development of a regular, national level cyber security exercise, the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA) hosted the first Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition for the Southwestern region in May 2005.  On June 29, 2010, United States House legislature passed recognizing the National CCDC for promoting cyber security curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr111-1244&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar to other cyber defense competitions in many aspects, the NCCDC, is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://seccdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The NCCDC is operated under the rules as published by the Center for Infrastructure and Assurance at UTSA.&lt;ref&gt;http://cias.utsa.edu/competitions.html&lt;/ref&gt; The current rules can be found at [http://www.nationalccdc.org/ Homepage].

==Regional Competitions==
Several regional groups have formed to provide qualifying events for the NCCDC annual event. Some regions share and overlap various states. Every effort is made to make each regional event consistent with the NCCDC event.

The '''Planet Simulator''' (also known as a '''Planetary Simulator''') is a machine designed to study the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] on planet [[Earth]] and beyond. The simulator machine was announced by researchers at [[McMaster University]] on behalf of the [[Origins Institute]] on 4 October 2018.&lt;ref name="BW-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Balch |first=Erica |title=Ground-breaking lab poised to unlock the mystery of the origins of life on Earth and beyond |url=https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/articles/ground-breaking-lab-poised-to-unlock-the-mystery-of-the-origins-of-life-on-earth-and-beyond/ |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[McMaster University]] |accessdate=4 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Ground-breaking lab poised to unlock the mystery of the origins of life |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/mu-glp100418.php |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GN-20181004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Casey |first=Liam |title=McMaster University researchers testing origins of life theory in new planet simulator |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4516282/mcmaster-researchers-planet-simulator/ |date=4 October 2018 |work=[[Global News]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IVG-2018"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Planet Simulator |url=https://www.intravisiongroup.com/planet-simulator |date=2018 |work=IntraVisionGroup.com |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chung |first=Emily |title=Canadian researchers use new 'planet simulator' to probe origins of life - 'Life is probably a relatively frequent process in the universe' new experiments suggests |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/origins-of-life-lab-1.4852248 |date=5 October 2018 |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=14 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-209181014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Paul Scott |title=New technology may help solve mystery of life's origins - How did life on Earth begin?

The one-of-a-kind planet simulator is about the size of a [[microwave oven]] and can control [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[pressure]], [[atmosphere]] and [[radiation levels]] that may be consistent with conditions on the early Earth, or conditions on other astronomical bodies, including other [[planet]]s, [[exoplanet]]s and the like.&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; The simulator project, begun in 2012, was funded with $1 million from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], the [[Ontario government]] and [[McMaster University]], and was built by [https://angstromengineering.com/ Angstrom Engineering Inc] of [[Kitchener, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="BW-20181004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005" /&gt;

==Observations==
According to researchers, preliminary tests with the simulator, under possible conditions of the [[early Earth]], created [[protocell]]s, not living but very important nonetheless.&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; According to biologist [[David W. Deamer|David Deamer]], the machine is a [[wiktionary:game changer|game changer]], and the cells produced so far are "significant". The "cells are not alive, but are [[Evolution|evolutionary steps]] toward a [[Life|living system of molecules]] ... [the simulator] opens up a lot of experimental activities that were literally impossible before.”&lt;ref name="GN-20181004" /&gt; Based on initial tests with the new simulator technology, project director Rheinstadter stated that it "seems that the formation of life is probably a relatively frequent process in the [[universe]]".&lt;ref name="CBC-20181005" /&gt;

'''Induced Systemic Resistance''' (ISR) is a resistance mechanism in [[plant]]s that is activated by [[infection]]. Its mode of action does not depend on direct killing or inhibition of the invading [[pathogen]], but rather on increasing [[Physical change|physical]] or [[chemical]] barrier of the [[host (biology)|host]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choudhary DK, Prakash A, Johri BN | title = Induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants: mechanism of action | journal = Indian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–97 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 23100680 | pmc = 3450033 | doi = 10.1007/s12088-007-0054-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Systemic acquired resistance|Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR)]] a plant can develop defenses against an invader such as a pathogen or parasite if an infection takes place.  In contrast to SAR which is triggered by accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins or [[salicylic acid]], ISR instead relies on [[signal transduction]] pathways activated by [[jasmonate]] and [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan Z, Reddy MS, Ryu CM, McInroy JA, Wilson M, Kloepper JW | title = Induced systemic protection against tomato late blight elicited by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 1329–33 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 18943888 | doi = 10.1094/phyto.2002.92.12.1329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The induction of plant-induced resistance to pathogen protection was identified in 1901 and was described as the "system of acquired resistance." Subsequently several different terms have been used, namely, "acquired physiological immunity", "resistance displacement", "plant immune function" and "induced system resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conrath U | title = Systemic acquired resistance | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 179–84 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 19521483 | pmc = 2634024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of stimulus have been found to induce the plant to the virus, bacteria and fungi and other disease resistance including Mechanical factors ([[dry ice]] damage, [[electromagnetic]], [[ultraviolet]], and low [[temperature]] and high temperature treatment, etc.) Chemical factors ([[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] salts, water, [[salicylic acid]]) and Biological factors ([[fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and their [[metabolite]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walters DR, Ratsep J, Havis ND | title = Controlling crop diseases using induced resistance: challenges for the future | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 1263–80 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23386685 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/ert026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode of action ==
Induced resistance of plants has two major modes of action: the SAR pathway and the ISR pathway. SAR can elicit a rapid local reaction, or [[hypersensitive response]], the pathogen is limited to a small area of the site of [[infection]]. As mentioned, salicylic acid is the mode of action for the SAR pathway. ISR acts on a jasmonic acid (JA) mode of action. Both act on the effect of the NPR-1, but SAR utilizes PR genes. ISR enhances the defense systems of the plant by It is important to note that the two mediated responses have regulatory effects on one another. As SA goes up, it can inhibit the effect of JA. There is a balance to be maintained when activating both responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Traw MB, Bergelson J | title = Interactive effects of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellin on induction of trichomes in Arabidopsis | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | pages = 1367–75 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14551332 | doi = 10.1104/pp.103.027086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biological factors of plant-induced system resistance generally include two broad categories, namely classical plant-induced resistance to disease induction (PGPR) or fungi that promote plant growth (PGPF), and plant growth-promoting [[rhizosphere]] bacteria (PGPR) or plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). The difference is mainly due to the fact that the latter can effectively promote plant growth and increase crop yield while causing (or increasing) plant resistance to diseases (sometimes including [[Pest (organism)|pests]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beneduzi A, Ambrosini A, Passaglia LM | title = Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR): Their potential as antagonists and biocontrol agents | journal = Genetics and Molecular Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 (suppl) | pages = 1044–51 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23411488 | pmc = 3571425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on insects ==

Some studies have also reported negative effects of beneficial microbes on plant-insect interactions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pineda A, Dicke M, Pieterse CM, Pozo MJ |date=2013-02-11|title=Beneficial microbes in a changing environment: are they always helping plants to deal with insects? |journal=Functional Ecology |volume=27|issue=3|pages=574–586|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied research==

To date, work on induction of plant systemic resistance has shown that inducing plant system resistance work has important implications for basic and applied research. 

Induced resistance applications in [[melon]]s, [[tobacco]], [[bean]], [[potato]], and [[rice]] have achieved significant success. Over the past decade, the study of induced system resistance has become a very active field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaturvedi S, Paul Khurana SM |date=July 6, 2018|title=Induced Systemic Resistance  |journal=Open Access Journal of Microbiology &amp; Biotechnology |url=https://medwinpublishers.com/OAJMB/OAJMB16000126.pdf |volume= 3 | issue = 1 |pages= 126 | doi = 10.23880/oajmb-16000126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to artificially activate the ISR pathway is an active area of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welling LL | title = Induced resistance: from the basic to the applied | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 445–7 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11686134 | doi = 10.1016/S1360-1385(01)02046-5 | url = https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(01)02046-5?large_figure=true&amp;code=cell-site }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research and application of inducing plant system resistance have been encouraging but are not yet a major factor in controlling plant pathogens. Incorporation into intergrated pest management programs have shown some promising results. There is research regarding defense against leaf chewing insect pests, by the activation of jasmonic acid signalling triggered by root-associated microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung SC, Martinez-Medina A, Lopez-Raez JA, Pozo MJ | title = Mycorrhiza-induced resistance and priming of plant defenses | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–64 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22623151 | doi = 10.1007/s10886-012-0134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ongoing research into ISR includes (1) how to systematically improve the selection of induction factors; (2) the injury of induced factors; (3) the phenomenon of multi-effect of induced factors; (4) the effects of chemical induction factors on environmental factors; (5) Establishment of population stability of multivariate biological inducible factor. Research into ISR is driven largely by a response to pesticide use including 1) Increasing resistance by pathogens to pesticides, 2) the necessity to remove some of the more toxic pesticides from the market, 3) health and environment problems caused as an effect of pesticide use, and 4) the inability of certain pesticides to control some pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EmRHv9xcpAIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Plant+breeding+for+ISR&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q9h12SQT48&amp;sig=zJJpIt0uLHLAri1XXD3kWJdBMJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk-ozMrPDeAhVlk-AKHc4CBAwQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Plant%20breeding%20for%20ISR&amp;f=false|title=Multigenic and Induced Systemic Resistance in Plants|last=Sadik|first=Tuzun|last2=Elizabeth|first2=Bent|date=2006-10-26|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387232669|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public address system''' ('''PA system''') is an electronic system comprising [[microphone]]s, [[amplifier]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, and related equipment. It increases the apparent [[sound pressure level|volume]] (loudness) of a human voice, musical instrument, or other acoustic sound source or recorded sound or music. PA systems are used in any public venue that requires that an announcer, performer, etc. be sufficiently audible at a distance or over a large area. Typical applications include sports stadiums, public transportation vehicles and facilities, and live or [[recorded music]] venues and events. A PA system may include multiple microphones or other sound sources, a [[mixing console]] to combine and modify multiple sources, and multiple amplifiers and loudspeakers for louder volume or wider distribution.

Simple PA systems are often used in small venues such as school auditoriums, churches, and small bars. PA systems with many speakers are widely used to make announcements in public, institutional and commercial buildings and locations—such as [[school]]s, [[stadium]]s, and passenger vessels and aircraft. [[Intercom]] systems, installed in many buildings, have both speakers throughout a building, and microphones in many rooms so occupants can respond to announcements. PA and Intercom systems are commonly used as part of an [[emergency communication system]].

The term, ''[[sound reinforcement system]]'' generally means a PA system specifically for live music or performance.&lt;ref name=paorsr&gt;{{cite web |title=Is it P.A. or SR? |author=Bruce Borgerson |date=November 1, 2003 |journal=Sound &amp; Video Contractor |publisher=Prism Business Media |url=http://mylocalnews.com/pa-system/is-it-p-a-or-sr/ |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520193257/http://mylocalnews.com/pa-system/is-it-p-a-or-sr/ |archivedate=May 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain any PA system is sometimes colloquially referred to as a [[Tannoy]], after the company of that name now owned by [[TC Electronic|TC Electronic Group]], which supplied a great many of the PA systems used previously in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tannoy definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/tannoy|publisher=Cambridge Online Dictionary|accessdate=19 May 2015|quote=a system of equipment that is used for making speech loud enough for a large number of people to hear, especially to give information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early systems==
===Megaphone===

[[File:MOHAI - firefighter's speaking trumpet 01A.jpg|thumb|A late 19th-century speaking trumpet used by [[firefighter]]s.]]
[[File:HPIM0145 megaphone.jpg|thumb|A small sports megaphone for cheering at sporting events, next to a 3 in. cigarette lighter for scale]]

From the Ancient Greek era to the nineteenth century, before the invention of electric loudspeakers and amplifiers, [[megaphone]] cones were used by people speaking to a large audience, to make their voice project more to a large space or group. Megaphones are typically portable, usually hand-held, cone-shaped [[horn (acoustic)|acoustic horn]]s used to [[amplifier|amplify]] a person’s voice or other [[sound]]s and direct it towards a given direction. The sound is introduced into the narrow end of the megaphone, by holding it up to the face and speaking into it. The sound projects out the wide end of the cone. The user can direct the sound by pointing the wide end of the cone in a specific direction. In the 2010s, [[cheerleading]] is one of the few fields where a nineteenth century-style cone is still used to project the voice. The device is also called “speaking-trumpet”, “bullhorn” or “loud hailer”.

===Automatic Enunciator===

In 1910, the [[Automatic Electric|Automatic Electric Company]] of Chicago, Illinois, already a major supplier of automatic telephone switchboards, announced it had developed a loudspeaker, which it marketed under the name of the ''Automatic Enunciator''. Company president Joseph Harris foresaw multiple potential uses, and the original publicity stressed the value of the invention as a hotel public address system, allowing people in all public rooms to hear announcements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85053089/1910-07-22/ed-1/seq-6/ "Replaces Bell Boy"], ''The (Culbertson, Montana) Searchlight'', July 22, 1910, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1910, an initial "semi-public" demonstration was given to newspaper reporters at the Automatic Electric Company building, where a speaker's voice was transmitted to loudspeakers placed in a dozen locations "all over the building".&lt;ref&gt;"Hear Sermon, Enjoy Pipe", ''The (Ottawa Kansas) Evening Herald'', June 25, 1910, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A short time later, the Automatic Enunciator Company formed in Chicago order to market the new device, and a series of promotional installations followed.&lt;ref name="formed"&gt;''Robert D. Fisher Manual of Valuable and Worthless Securities: Volume 6'' (1938), page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1912 a large outdoor installation was made at a water carnival held in Chicago by the Associated Yacht and Power Boat Clubs of America. Seventy-two loudspeakers were strung in pairs at forty-foot (12 meter) intervals along the docks, spanning a total of one-half mile (800 meters) of grandstands. The system was used to announce race reports and descriptions, carry a series of speeches about "The Chicago Plan", and provide music between races.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qUo_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%22Automatic+Telephone+and+Enunciator+Carnival+Features%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8wzpQJli2X&amp;sig=HnShC28qhSiiwcJc3yKNOMfMOcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjykJ3NuMrMAhUWz2MKHbNDBsMQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Automatic%20Telephone%20and%20Enunciator%20Carnival%20Features%22&amp;f=false "Automatic Telephone and Enunciator Carnival Features"], ''Telephony'', August 24, 1912, pages 246-247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, multiple units were installed throughout the [[Comiskey Park]] baseball stadium in Chicago, both to make announcements and to provide musical interludes,&lt;ref&gt;"Loud-Speaking Telephone Enunciators in Baseball Grand Stand", ''Electrical World'', August 2, 1913, page 251.&lt;/ref&gt; with Charles A. Comiskey quoted as saying: "The day of the megaphone man has passed at our park." The company also set up an experimental service, called the [[Musolaphone]], that was used to transmitted news and entertainment programming to home and business subscribers in south-side Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WwXnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Increasing+the+Revenue+Producing+Efficiency+of+a+Plant%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gYHtQZQeyz&amp;sig=sjcU9YuPYJyp6_VrlgxD9B4SGjo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJq8CvvMrMAhUP7WMKHWxFDdsQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Increasing%20the%20Revenue%20Producing%20Efficiency%20of%20a%20Plant%22&amp;f=false "Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant"] by Stanley R. Edwards, ''Telephony'', October 11, 1913, pages 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; but this effort was short-lived. The company continued to market the enunciators for making announcements in establishments such as hospitals, department stores, factories, and railroad stations, although the Automatic Enunciator Company was dissolved in 1926.&lt;ref name="formed" /&gt;

===Magnavox===

[[File:Early vacuum tube public address system.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Early public-address system from around 1920 using a Magnavox speaker.  The microphone had a metal reflector that concentrated the sound waves, allowing the speaker to stand back so it wouldn't obscure his or her face.  The early [[vacuum tube]]s couldn't produce much [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], and even with six tubes the amplifier had low power. To produce enough volume, the system used a [[horn loudspeaker]].  The cylindrical [[compression driver|driver]] unit under the horn contained the diaphragm, which the voice coil vibrated to produce sound through a flaring [[horn (acoustic)|horn]]. It produced far more volume from a given amplifier than a cone speaker.  Horns were used in virtually all early PA systems, and are still used in the 2010s in most systems, at least for the high-range tweeters.]]

Edwin Jensen and Peter Pridham of [[Magnavox]] began experimenting with sound reproduction in the 1910s. Working from a laboratory in [[Napa, California]], they filed the first patent for a [[moving coil loudspeaker]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a"&gt;{{cite web|author=Yaxleys Sound Systems|title=The First Outside Broadcast 1915|year=2002|url=http://www.historyofpa.co.uk/pages/history.htm|work=History of PA|publisher=History of PA Charity Trust|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, in 1915, they built a dynamic loudspeaker with a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} [[voice coil]], a {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} corrugated [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] and a [[Horn (acoustic)|horn]] measuring {{convert|34|in|cm}} with a {{convert|22|in|cm|adj=on}} aperture. The [[electromagnet]] created a flux field of approximately 11,000 [[Gauss (unit)|Gauss]].&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;

Their first experiment used a [[carbon microphone]].  When the 12 V battery was connected to the system, they experienced one of the first examples of [[acoustic feedback]],&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; a typically unwanted effect often characterized by high-pitched sounds. They then placed the loudspeaker on the laboratory's roof, and claims say that the amplified human voice could be heard {{convert|1|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; Jensen and Pridham refined the system and connected a [[phonograph]] to the loudspeaker so it could broadcast recorded music.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1986"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd|first=Gerald A|title=When the President Spoke at Balboa Stadium|year=1986|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/86spring/president.htm|publisher=The Journal of San Diego History|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did this on a number of occasions, including once at the Napa laboratory, at the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]],&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; and on December 24, 1915 at [[San Francisco City Hall]] alongside [[Mayor of San Francisco|Mayor]] [[James Rolph]].&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1986" /&gt; This demonstration was official presentation of the working system, and approximately 100,000 people gathered to hear Christmas music and speeches "with absolute distinctness".&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;

The first [[outside broadcast]] was made one week later, again supervised by Jensen and Pridham.&lt;ref name=paorsr /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crow Bozeman 1998 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Michael M|title=Limited by design: R&amp;D laboratories in the U.S. national innovation system|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0231109822|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, when [[Governor of California]] [[Hiram Johnson]] was too ill to give a speech in person, loudspeakers were installed at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]], connected to Johnson's house some miles away by cable and a microphone, from where he delivered his speech.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; Jensen oversaw the governor using the microphone while Pridham operated the loudspeaker.

The following year, Jensen and Pridham applied for a patent for what they called their "Sound Magnifying Phonograph". Over the next two years they developed their first valve amplifier.  In 1919 this was standardized as a 3-stage 25 watt amplifier.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;

This system was used by former US president [[William Howard Taft]] at a speech in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Chicago]], and first used by a current president when [[Woodrow Wilson]] addressed 50,000 people in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref name="Crow Bozeman 1998 145" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Michael|title=Woodrow Wilson's Western Tour: Rhetoric, Public Opinion, And the League of Nations|date=2006|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=9781585445332|page=10|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=P1jqotqWvd4C&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=Woodrow+Wilson+san+diego+1919+50.000+crowd&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fDzQvGYl9l&amp;sig=Nm-oav7I38-LY2SlE_2BYX0VBQg&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwA2oVChMI0si71O2VyQIVwxOQCh2ZXwL7#v=onepage&amp;q=Woodrow%20Wilson%20san%20diego%201919%2050.000%20crowd&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's speech was part of his nationwide tour to promote the establishment of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schoenherr|first=Steven|title=Woodrow Wilson in San Diego 1919|year=2001|url=http://homepage.mac.com/oldtownman/recording/wilson.html|publisher=Recording Technology History Notes|accessdate=25 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113015655/http://homepage.mac.com/oldtownman/recording/wilson.html|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held on September 9, 1919 at [[Balboa Stadium|City Stadium]]. As with the San Francisco installation, Jensen supervised the microphone and Pridham the loudspeakers. Wilson spoke into two large horns mounted on his platform, which channelled his voice into the microphone.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 2001" /&gt; Similar systems were used in the following years by [[Warren G. Harding]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;

===Marconi===

By the early 1920s, [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] had established a department dedicated to public address and began producing loudspeakers and amplifiers to match a growing demand.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; In 1925, [[George V]] used such a system at the [[British Empire Exhibition]], addressing 90,000 via six long-range loudspeakers.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt; This public use of loudspeakers brought attention to the possibilities of such technology.  The 1925 Royal Air Force Pageant at [[Hendon Aerodrome]] used a Marconi system to allow the announcer to address the crowds, as well as amplify the band.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;  In 1929, the [[Schneider Trophy]] race at [[Calshot Spit]] used a public address system that had 200 horns, weighing a total of 20 [[ton]]s.&lt;ref name="Yaxley 2002a" /&gt;

===Late 1920s-1930s===
Engineers invented the first loud, powerful amplifier and speaker systems for public address systems and [[movie theater]]s. These large PA systems and movie theatre sound systems were very large and very expensive, and so they could not be used by most touring musicians. After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered PA systems that could be plugged into a regular wall socket "quickly became popular with musicians"; indeed, "...[[Leon McAuliffe]] (with [[Bob Wills]]) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935." During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable PA systems and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a "single volume control and one or two input jacks, field coil speakers" and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch.&lt;ref name="vintageguitar.com"&gt;https://www.vintageguitar.com/1804/antique-guitar-amps-1928-1934&lt;/ref&gt; Portable PA systems you could plug into wall sockets appeared in the early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into wall outlets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs.

===Electric megaphone===
[[File:"Geração à Rasca" Demonstration.jpg|thumb|right|209px|A woman using a small handheld electric megaphone at a demonstration in Portugal. Electric megaphones use a type of [[horn loudspeaker]] called a ''reflex'' or ''reentrant horn''. ]]
In the 1960s, an electric-amplified version of the megaphone, which used a loudspeaker, amplifier and a folded horn, largely replaced the basic cone-style megaphone. Small handheld, battery-powered electric megaphones are used by fire and rescue personnel, police, protesters, and people addressing outdoor audiences. With many small handheld models, the microphone is mounted at the back end of the device, and the user holds the megaphone in front of her/his mouth to use it, and presses a trigger to turn on the amplifier and loudspeaker. Larger electric megaphones may have a microphone attached by a cable, which enables a person to speak without having their face obscured by the flared horn.

[[File:Pa system.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Public address system in an old [[high school]]]]
The simplest, smallest PA systems consist of a microphone, an amplifier, and one or more loudspeakers. PA systems of this type, often providing 50 to 200 watts of power, are often used in small venues such as school auditoriums, churches, and coffeehouse stages. Small PA systems may extend to an entire building, such as a restaurant, store, elementary school or office building. A sound source such as a [[compact disc]] player or radio may be connected to a PA system so that music can be played through the system. Smaller, battery-powered 12 volt systems may be installed in vehicles such as tour buses or school buses, so that the tour guide and/or driver can speak to all the passengers. Portable systems may be battery powered and/or powered by plugging the system into an electric wall socket. These may also be used for by people addressing smaller groups such as information sessions or team meetings. Battery-powered systems can be used by guides who are speaking to clients on walking tours.

Public address systems consist of input sources (microphones, sound playback devicrs, etc.), [[amplifiers]], control and monitoring equipment (e.g., LED indicator lights, VU meters, headphones), and [[loudspeakers]]. Usual input include [[microphone]]s for speech or singing, direct inputs from musical instruments, and a recorded sound playback device. In non-performance applications, there may be a system that operators or automated equipment uses to select from a number of standard prerecorded messages. These input sources feed into preamplifiers and signal routers that direct the audio signal to selected zones of a facility (e.g., only to one section of a school). The preamplified signals then pass into the amplifiers. Depending on local practices, these amplifiers usually amplify the audio signals to 50V, 70V, or 100V speaker line level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.audeval.co.uk/three-mysterious-pava-facts-every-good-fire-tech-needs-know/|title = 100 volt line|date = |accessdate = 20 November 2015|website = www.audeval.co.uk|publisher = |last = Nigel|first = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control equipment monitors the amplifiers and speaker lines for faults before it reaches the loudspeakers. This control equipment is also used to separate zones in a PA system. The loudspeaker converts electrical signals into sound.

==Large systems==
[[File:Public Address System rack 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Public address system consisting of amplifiers, mixers, and routers for a major international airport]]
Some PA systems have speakers that cover more than one building, extending to an entire campus of a college, office or industrial site, or an entire outdoor complex (e.g., an athletic stadium). A large PA system may also be used as an [[Fire alarm notification appliance#Voice evacuation|alert]] system during an emergency.

==Telephone paging systems==
Some [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) telephone systems use a paging facility that acts as a liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system.  Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system.  The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, so the system can send announcements to the phone speakers.

Many retailers and offices choose to use the telephone system as the sole access point for the paging system, because the features are integrated.  Many schools and other larger institutions are no longer using the large, bulky microphone PA systems and have switched to telephone system paging, as it can be accessed from many different points in the school.

==PA over IP==
''PA over IP'' refers to PA paging and [[intercom]] systems that use an Internet Protocol (IP) network, instead of a central amplifier, to distribute the audio signal to paging locations across a building or campus, or anywhere else in the reach of the IP network, including the Internet. Network-attached amplifiers and intercom units are used to provide the communication function. At the transmission end, a computer application transmits a digital audio stream via the local area network, using audio from the computer's [[sound card]] inputs or from stored audio recordings. At the receiving end, either specialized intercom modules (sometimes known as [[IP speaker]]s) receive these network transmissions and reproduce the analog audio signal. These are small, specialized network appliances addressable by an IP address, just like any other computer on the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kintronics.com/network-attached-amplifiers-ip-intercoms-work-2/ |title=How Network Attached Amplifiers and IP Intercoms Work |author=Bob Mesnik |date= |website=Kintronics.com |publisher= |accessdate=2017-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WMT PA Systems==
''Wireless Mobile Telephony (WMT) PA Systems'' refers to PA paging and [intercom] systems that use any form of Wireless mobile telephony system such as GSM networks instead of a centralized amplifier to distribute the audio signal to paging locations across a building or campus, or other location. The GSM mobile Networks are used to provide the communication function. At the transmission end, a PSTN Telephone, mobile phone, VOIP phone or any other communication device that can access and make audio calls to a GSM based mobile SIM card can communicate with it. At the receiving end, a GSM transceiver receives these network transmissions and reproduce the analogue audio signal via a Power Amplifier and speaker. This was pioneered by Stephen Robert Pearson of Lancashire, England who was granted patents for the systems, which also incorporate control functionality. Using a WMT (GSM) network means that live announcements can be made to anywhere in the world where there is WMT connectivity. The patents cover all forms of WMT i.e., 2G, 3G, 4G ..... xxG. A UK company called Remvox Ltd (REMote VOice eXperience) has been appointed under license to develop and manufacture products based on the technology.

==Long line PA==
[[File:Long Line Public Address Announcement.jpg|thumb|left|200px|London Underground employee making a Long Line Public Address system announcement using an RPA01 Radio Microphone at Bank Station]]
A Long-Line Public Address (LLPA) system is any public address system with a distributed architecture, normally across a wide geographic area.  Systems of this type are commonly found in the rail, light rail, and metro industries, and let announcements be triggered from one or several locations to the rest of the network over low bandwidth legacy copper, normally [[PSTN]] lines using [[DSL modems]], or media such as [[optical fiber]], or [[GSM-R]], or IP-based networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asl-control.co.uk/downloads/technical-guides/mini-ivencs-user-manual.pdf|format=PDF|title=User Manual for an IP based Long Line PA System|website=Asl-control.co.uk|accessdate=2017-01-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603174926/http://www.asl-control.co.uk/downloads/technical-guides/mini-ivencs-user-manual.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail systems typically have an interface with a [[passenger information system]] (PIS) server, at each station. These are linked to train describers, which state the location of rolling stock on the network from sensors on trackside signaling equipment. The PIS invokes a stored message to play from a local or remote digital voice announcement system, or a series of message fragments to [[Speech synthesis#Domain-specific synthesis|assemble in the correct order]], for example: " / the / 23.30 / First_Great_Western / Night_Riviera_sleeper_service / from / London_Paddington / to / Penzance / .... / will depart from platform / one / this train is formed of  / 12_carriages /." Messages are routed via an IP network and are played on local amplification equipment.  Taken together, the PA, routing, DVA, passenger displays and PIS interface are referred to as the ''customer information system (CIS)'', a term often used interchangeably with ''passenger information system''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Small venue systems==
Small clubs, bars and coffeehouses use a fairly simple set-up, with front of house speaker cabinets (and subwoofers, in some cases) aimed at the audience, and [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]] cabinets aimed back at the performers so they can hear their vocals and instruments. In many cases, front of house speakers are elevated, either by mounting them on poles or by "flying" them from anchors in the ceiling. The Front of House speakers are elevated to prevent the sound from being absorbed by the first few rows of audience members. The subwoofers do not need to be elevated, because deep bass is omnidirectional. In the smallest [[coffeehouse]]s and bars, the [[audio mixer]] may be onstage so that the performers can mix their own sound levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleverjoe.com/articles/sound_engineer_bands.html |title=Bands Who Do Their Own Sound. Audio Engineering Music Column |website=Cleverjoe.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In larger bars, the audio mixer may be located in or behind the audience seating area, so that an audio engineer can listen to the mix and adjust the sound levels. The adjustments to the monitor speaker mix may be made by a single audio engineer using the main mixing board, or they may be made by a second audio engineer who uses a separate mixing board.
[[File:Vera Project 12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This small venue's stage shows a typical PA system.]]

==Large venue systems==
For popular music concerts, a more powerful and more complicated PA System is used to provide [[live sound reproduction]]. In a concert setting, there are typically two complete PA systems: the "main" system and the "monitor" system. Each system consists of a mixing board, sound processing equipment, amplifiers, and speakers. The microphones that are used to pick up vocals and amplifier sounds are routed through both the main and monitor systems. Audio engineers can set different sound levels for each microphone on the main and monitor systems. For example, a [[backup vocals|backup vocalist]] whose voice has a low sound level in the main mix may ask for a much louder sound level through her monitor speaker, so she can hear her singing. 
* The "main" system (also known as ''[[Front of House]]'', commonly abbreviated FOH), which provides the amplified sound for the audience, typically uses a number of powerful amplifiers that drive a range of large, heavy-duty loudspeakers—including low-frequency speaker cabinets called subwoofers, full-range speaker cabinets, and high-range horns. A large club may use amplifiers to provide 3000 to 5000 watts of power to the "main" speakers. An outdoor concert may use 10,000 or more watts.
* The ''[[foldback (sound engineering)|monitor]]'' system reproduces the sounds of the performance and directs them towards the onstage performers (typically using wedge-shaped monitor speaker cabinets), to help them to hear the instruments and vocals.  In British English, the monitor system is referred to as the "foldback". The monitor system in a large club may provide 500 to 1000 watts of power to several foldback speakers; at an outdoor concert, there may be several thousand watts of power going to the monitor system.

At a concert using live sound reproduction, sound engineers and technicians control the mixing boards for the "main" and "monitor" systems, adjusting tone, levels, and overall volume.

[[File:Line Array and Subs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[line array]] speaker system and subwoofer cabinets at a live music concert]]
Touring productions travel with relocatable large [[Line array|line-array]] PA systems, sometimes rented from an audio equipment hire company. The sound equipment moves from venue to venue along with various other equipment such as lighting and projection.

==Acoustic feedback==
All PA systems have the potential for [[audio feedback]], which occurs when a microphone picks up sound from the speakers, which is re-amplified and sent through the speakers again.  It often sounds like a loud high-pitched squeal or screech, and can occur when the volume of the system is turned up too high.  Feedback only occurs when the [[loop gain]] of the feedback loop is greater than one, so it can always be stopped by reducing the volume sufficiently.

Sound engineers take several steps to maximize [[gain before feedback]], including keeping microphones at a distance from speakers, ensuring that directional microphones are not pointed towards speakers, keeping the onstage volume levels down, and lowering gain levels at frequencies where the feedback is occurring, using a [[graphic equalizer]], a [[parametric equalizer]], or a [[notch filter]]. Some 2010s-era [[mixing console]]s and [[effects unit]]s have automatic feedback preventing circuits.

Feedback prevention devices detect the start of unwanted feedback and use a precise notch filter to lower the gain of the frequencies that are feeding back. Some automated feedback detectors require the user to “set” the feedback-prone frequencies by purposely increasing gain (during a sound check) until some feedback starts to occur. The device then retains these frequencies in its memory and it stands by ready to cut them. Some automated feedback prevention devices can detect and reduce new frequencies other than those found in the sound check.

'''Reproductive toxicity''' is a hazard associated with some [[chemical substance]]s, that they will interfere in some way with normal [[reproduction]]; such substances are called '''reprotoxic'''. It includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in the offspring.&lt;ref name="CLP"&gt;Annex I, section 3.7, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'', L353, 31.12.2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–1355, at pp.&amp;nbsp;107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GHS"&gt;{{GHS|part=3|chapter=3.7|pages=175–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Principles For Evaluating Health Risks To Reproduction Associated With Exposure To Chemicals | journal = Environmental Health Criteria | volume = 225 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc225.htm | location = Geneva | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2001 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

One well known group of substances which are toxic for reproduction are [[teratogen]]s – substances which cause birth defects – of which [[Thalidomide|(''S'')-thalidomide]] is possibly the most notorious. Another group of substances which have received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic for reproduction are the so-called [[endocrine disruptor]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{Cite document | title = Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disruptors | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva | url = http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/new_issues/endocrine_disruptors/en/ | year = 2002 | id = WHO/PCS/EDC/02.2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Many drugs have effects on the [[human reproductive system]]: these may be desired ([[hormonal contraception]]), a minor unwanted side effect (many [[antidepressant]]s) or a major public health problem (thalidomide). However, most studies of reproductive toxicity has focused on occupational or environmental exposure to chemicals and their effects on reproduction. It may be noted that both consumption of alcohol and tobacco smoking are known to be "toxic for reproduction" in the sense that the term is used here.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an example of an endocrine disruptor which negatively affects reproductive development. BPA is a known as estrogen mimicker (Xenoestrogen) and a likely androgen mimicker, which is used in the production of various plastic products. BPA exposure in fetal female rats lead to mammary gland morphogenesis, increased formation of ovarian tumors, and increased risk of developing mammary gland neoplasia in adult life. Additionally, BPA affects male fertility by resulting in lower sperm quality and sex function. The toxicological impact of BPA is better understood and studied in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;Jones BA, Wagner LS, Watson NV (March 2016). “The Effects of Bisphenol A Exposure at Different Developmental Time Points in an Androgen-Sensitive Neuromuscular System in Male Rats”.

Reproductive Toxicology. 42: 132–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead is a heavy metal that not only has been associated with mental deficits, but male infertility and male reproductive issues. Lead is believed to predominantly affect male reproduction via disruption of hormones. Through this hormonal disruption, the process of sperm production in the seminiferous tubules is reduced. Another proposed mechanism of poor semen quality due to lead exposure has been attributed to lead’s ability to cause increases in reactive oxygen species due to lipid peroxidation, leading to cellular damage.&lt;ref&gt;Vigeh M, Smith DR, Hsu P-C. How does lead induce male fertility? Iranian Journal of Reproductive Medicine. 2011; 9(1):1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorostghoal, M., Seyyednejad, S.M., Jabari, A. (2014). Protective effects of Fumaria parviflora L. on lead-induced testicular toxicity in male rates. Andrologia, 46(4), 437-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reproductive toxins such as Thalidomide were once prescribed and used for therapeutic effects. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Thalidomide was widely used in Europe as an anti-nausea medication to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. It wasn't until the 1960s  was found that Thalidomide altered embryo development and led to limb deformities such as thumb absence, under development of entire limbs, or phocomelia. The teratogenic effects of Thalidomide have been proposed to affect more that ten thousand babies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Kim JH, Scialli AR.

The thalidomide experience: review of its effects 50 years later. 2012 Jun 2;139(1):25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen known to be another reproductive toxin, was used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent spontaneous abortions from occurring in women. DES causes carcinogenic and mutagenic effects via the production of highly reactive metabolites, furthermore resulting in the formation of DNA adducts. Individuals exposed to DES in utero suffer atypical reproductive tract formation. Specifically, females exposed, in utero, to DES during the first trimester have an increased risk of developing clear cell vaginal carcinoma, and males an increased risk of hypospadias.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Klip, MPH, Janneke Verloop, MSc, Jan D van Gool, MD, Marlies ETA Koster, MSc, Prof Curt W Burger, MD, Prof Flora E van Leeuwen, MD, for the OMEGA project group.(2002, March 30) Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study.

[[Aristotle]] defines rhetoric as "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of [[persuasion]]" and since mastery of the art was necessary for victory in a case at law or for passage of proposals in the assembly or for fame as a speaker in civic ceremonies, calls it "a combination of the science of logic and of the ethical branch of politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet1-4.html Aristotle's Rhetoric, Book I, Chapter 2, Section 1359 (trans.

From [[Ancient Greece]] to the late 19th century, rhetoric, which along with [[grammar]] and [[logic]] (or [[dialectic]]&amp;nbsp;– see [[Martianus Capella]]) is one of the [[Trivium|three ancient arts of discourse]], played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Thomas Conley, Rhetoric in the European Tradition ([[University of Chicago]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The definition of rhetoric is a controversial subject within the field and has given rise to philological battles over its meaning in Ancient Greece. See, for instance, Johnstone, Henry W. Jr. (1995). "On Schiappa versus Poulakos." ''Rhetoric Review.'' 14:2. (Spring), 438–40. {{doi|10.1080/07350199609389075}}. {{JSTOR|465873}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Scope===
Scholars have debated the scope of rhetoric since ancient times. Although some have limited rhetoric to the specific realm of political discourse, many modern scholars liberate it to encompass every aspect of culture. Contemporary studies of rhetoric address a much more diverse range of domains than was the case in ancient times. While classical rhetoric trained speakers to be effective persuaders in public forums and institutions such as courtrooms and assemblies, contemporary rhetoric investigates human discourse [[wikt:writ large|writ large]]. Rhetoricians have studied the discourses of a wide variety of domains, including the natural and social sciences, fine art, religion, journalism, digital media, fiction, history, cartography, and architecture, along with the more traditional domains of politics and the law.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Nelson, Allan Megill, and Donald N. McCloskey ''[http://hhs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/3/2/305?ck=nck The Rhetoric of Human Sciences: Language and Argument in Scholarship and Public Affairs]'', London: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987. ;
"In the last ten years, many scholars have investigated exactly how rhetoric works within a particular field."

(1998) ''Tropes of Politics'' (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press); Brown, R. H. (1987) ''Society as Text'' (Chicago, [[University of Chicago Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary approaches treat rhetoric as human communication that includes purposeful and strategic manipulation of symbols. Public relations, lobbying, law, marketing, professional and technical writing, and advertising are modern professions that employ rhetorical practitioners.

Because the ancient Greeks highly valued public political participation, rhetoric emerged as a crucial tool to influence politics. Consequently, rhetoric remains associated with its political origins. However, even the original instructors of Western speech—the [[Sophists]]—disputed this limited view of rhetoric.  According to the Sophists, such as [[Gorgias]], a successful rhetorician could speak convincingly on any topic, regardless of his experience in that field. This method suggested rhetoric could be a means of communicating any expertise, not just politics. In his ''[[Encomium to Helen]]'', Gorgias even applied rhetoric to fiction by seeking for his own pleasure to prove the blamelessness of the mythical [[Helen of Troy]] in starting the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosamond Kent Sprague, ed., "The Older Sophists: A Complete Translations by Several Hands of the Fragments" in ''Die Fragmente Der Vorsokratiker'', Edited by Diels-Kranz (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 1972), 50–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking to another key rhetorical theorist, [[Plato]] defined the scope of rhetoric according to his negative opinions of the art.  He criticized the Sophists for using rhetoric as a means of deceit instead of discovering truth.  In "Gorgias", one of his [[Socratic Dialogues]], Plato defines rhetoric as the persuasion of ignorant masses within the courts and assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, "Gorgias," [http://www.classicallibrary.org/plato/dialogues/15_gorgias.htm The Classical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric, in Plato's opinion, is merely a form of flattery and functions similarly to cookery, which masks the undesirability of unhealthy food by making it taste good.  Thus, Plato considered any speech of lengthy [[prose]] aimed at flattery as within the scope of rhetoric.

Aristotle both redeemed rhetoric from his teacher and narrowed its focus by defining three genres of rhetoric—[[deliberative]], [[forensic rhetoric|forensic]] or judicial, and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/#agenda Aristotle's Rhetoric&amp;nbsp;– The Agenda of the Rhetoric]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, even as he provided order to existing rhetorical theories, Aristotle extended the definition of rhetoric, calling it the ability to identify the appropriate means of persuasion in a given situation, thereby making rhetoric applicable to all fields, not just politics. When one considers that rhetoric included torture (in the sense that the practice of torture is a form of persuasion or coercion), it is clear that rhetoric cannot be viewed only in academic terms. However, the [[enthymeme]] based upon [[logic]] (especially, based upon the syllogism) was viewed as the basis of rhetoric.

However, since the time of Aristotle, logic has changed. For example, [[Modal logic]] has undergone a major development that also modifies rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Kennedy, ''Aristotle, On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, Aristotle also outlined generic constraints that focused the rhetorical art squarely within the domain of public political practice.  He restricted rhetoric to the domain of the [[contingent]] or probable: those matters that admit multiple legitimate opinions or arguments.

The contemporary [[neo-Aristotelian]] and [[neo-Sophistic]] positions on rhetoric mirror the division between the Sophists and Aristotle.  Neo-Aristotelians generally study rhetoric as political discourse, while the neo-Sophistic view contends that rhetoric cannot be so limited.  Rhetorical scholar [[Michael Leff]] characterizes the conflict between these positions as viewing rhetoric as a "thing contained" versus a "container". The neo-Aristotelian view threatens the study of rhetoric by restraining it to such a limited field, ignoring many critical applications of rhetorical theory, criticism, and practice. Simultaneously, the neo-Sophists threaten to expand rhetoric beyond a point of coherent theoretical value.

Over the past century, people studying rhetoric have tended to enlarge its object domain beyond speech texts.  [[Kenneth Burke]] asserted humans use rhetoric to resolve conflicts by identifying shared characteristics and interests in symbols.  By nature, humans engage in [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], either to identify themselves or another individual with a group.  This definition of [[Identification in rhetoric|rhetoric as identification]] broadened the scope from strategic and overt political persuasion to the more implicit tactics of identification found in an immense range of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Burke, ''A Rhetoric of Motives,'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many scholars who have since pursued Burke's line of thought, [[James Boyd White]] sees rhetoric as a broader domain of social experience in his notion of [[constitutive rhetoric]].  Influenced by theories of [[social construction]], White argues that culture is "reconstituted" through language.  Just as language influences people, people influence language.  Language is socially constructed, and depends on the meanings people attach to it.  Because language is not rigid and changes depending on the situation, the very usage of language is rhetorical. An author, White would say, is always trying to construct a new world and persuading his or her readers to share that world within the text.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''When Words Lose Their Meaning'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals engage in the rhetorical process anytime they speak or produce meaning.  Even in the field of [[science]], the practices of which were once viewed as being merely the objective testing and reporting of knowledge, scientists must persuade their audience to accept their findings by sufficiently demonstrating that their study or experiment was conducted reliably and resulted in sufficient evidence to support their conclusions.

The vast scope of rhetoric is difficult to define; however, political discourse remains, in many ways, the paradigmatic example for studying and theorizing specific techniques and conceptions of persuasion, considered by many a synonym for "rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leff, "The Habitation of Rhetoric" in ''Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader'', ed. John Louis Lucaites, et al. (New York: Guilford Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a civic art===
Throughout [[European History]], rhetoric has concerned itself with persuasion in public and political settings such as assemblies and courts. Because of its associations with democratic institutions, rhetoric is commonly said to flourish in open and democratic societies with rights of [[free speech]], free assembly, and political enfranchisement for some portion of the population. Those who classify rhetoric as a civic art believe that rhetoric has the power to shape communities, form the character of citizens and greatly effect civic life.

Rhetoric was viewed as a civic art by several of the ancient philosophers. Aristotle and [[Isocrates]] were two of the first to see rhetoric in this light. In his work, [[Antidosis]], Isocrates states, "We have come together and founded cities and made laws and invented arts; and, generally speaking, there is no institution devised by man which the power of speech has not helped us to establish." With this statement he argues that rhetoric is a fundamental part of civic life in every society and that it has been necessary in the foundation of all aspects of society. He further argues in his piece [[Against the Sophists]] that rhetoric, although it cannot be taught to just anyone, is capable of shaping the character of man. He writes, "I do think that the study of political discourse can help more than any other thing to stimulate and form such qualities of character." Aristotle, writing several years after Isocrates, supported many of his arguments and continued to make arguments for rhetoric as a civic art.

In the words of Aristotle, in the ''Rhetoric'', rhetoric is "...&amp;nbsp;the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion". According to Aristotle, this art of persuasion could be used in public settings in three different ways. He writes in Book&amp;nbsp;I, Chapter&amp;nbsp;III, "A member of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers. From this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory&amp;nbsp;–  (1) political, (2) forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display". Eugene Garver, in his critique of "Aristotle's Rhetoric", confirms that Aristotle viewed rhetoric as a civic art. Garver writes, "Rhetoric articulates a civic art of rhetoric, combining the almost incompatible properties of techne and appropriateness to citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Garver, Eugene. ''Aristotle's Rhetoric''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of Aristotle's divisions plays a role in civic life and can be used in a different way to affect cities.

Because rhetoric is a public art capable of shaping opinion, some of the ancients including [[Plato]] found fault in it. They claimed that while it could be used to improve civic life, it could be used equally easily to deceive or manipulate with negative effects on the city. The masses were incapable of analyzing or deciding anything on their own and would therefore be swayed by the most persuasive speeches. Thus, civic life could be controlled by the one who could deliver the best speech. Plato explores the problematic moral status of rhetoric twice: in ''[[Gorgias]]'', a [[dialogue]] named for the famed Sophist, and in ''The [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', a dialogue best known for its commentary on love. This concern is still maintained to nowadays.

More trusting in the power of rhetoric to support a republic, the Roman orator [[Cicero]] argued that art required something more than eloquence. A good orator needed also to be a good man, a person enlightened on a variety of civic topics. He describes the proper training of the orator in his major text on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', modeled on Plato's dialogues.

Modern day works continue to support the claims of the ancients that rhetoric is an art capable of influencing civic life. In his work ''Political Style'', [[Robert Hariman]] claims, "Furthermore, questions of freedom, equality, and justice often are raised and addressed through performances ranging from debates to demonstrations without loss of moral content".&lt;ref&gt;Hariman, Robert. ''Political Style: The Artistry of Power''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Boyd White]] argues further that rhetoric is capable not only of addressing issues of political interest but that it can influence culture as a whole. In his book, ''When Words Lose Their Meaning'', he argues that words of persuasion and identification define community and civic life. He states that words produce "the methods by which culture is maintained, criticized, and transformed".&lt;ref&gt;White, James B. ''When Words Lose Their Meaning''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both White and Hariman agree that words and rhetoric have the power to shape culture and civic life.

In modern times, rhetoric has consistently remained relevant as a civic art. In speeches, as well as in non-verbal forms, rhetoric continues to be used as a tool to influence communities from local to national levels.

===As a course of study===
Rhetoric as a course of study has evolved significantly since its ancient beginnings.  Through the ages, the study and teaching of rhetoric has adapted to the particular exigencies of the time and venue.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A. ''Classical Rhetoric &amp; Its Christian and Secular Tradition''. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of rhetoric has conformed to a multitude of different applications, ranging from architecture to literature.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Brian. "Deconstruction's Designs on Rhetoric." ''Rhetoric and Pedagogy: Its History, Philosophy, and Practice''. Ed. Winifred Bryan Horner and Michael Leff. 295–315.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the curriculum has transformed in a number of ways, it has generally emphasized the study of principles and rules of composition as a means for moving audiences. Generally speaking, the study of rhetoric trains students to speak and/or write effectively, as well as critically understand and analyze discourse.

Rhetoric began as a civic art in Ancient Greece where students were trained to develop tactics of oratorical persuasion, especially in legal disputes. Rhetoric originated in a school of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers known as the [[Sophists]] circa 600 BC. [[Demosthenes]] and [[Lysias]] emerged as major orators during this period, and [[Isocrates]] and [[Gorgias]] as prominent teachers.  Rhetorical education focused on five particular canons: ''inventio'' (invention), ''dispositio'' (arrangement), ''elocutio'' (style), ''memoria'' (memory), and ''actio'' (delivery).  Modern teachings continue to reference these rhetorical leaders and their work in discussions of classical rhetoric and persuasion.

Rhetoric was later taught in universities during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the three original [[liberal arts]] or [[trivium (education)|trivium]] (along with [[logic]] and [[grammar]]).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Conley, T.M. (1990) ''Rhetoric in the European Tradition''. (University of Chicago Press.; Kennedy, G.A., 1994). ''A New History of Classical Rhetoric''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, political rhetoric declined as republican oratory died out and the emperors of Rome garnered increasing authority.  With the rise of European monarchs in following centuries, rhetoric shifted into the courtly and religious applications.  [[Augustine]] exerted strong influence on Christian rhetoric in the Middle Ages, advocating the use of rhetoric to lead audiences to truth and understanding, especially in the church.  The study of liberal arts, he believed, contributed to rhetorical study: "In the case of a keen and ardent nature, fine words will come more readily through reading and hearing the eloquent than by pursuing the rules of rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;"Rhetoric." Augnet. n.p., 2010. Web. 12 April 2010. [http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=412 Augnet.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912094446/https://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=412 |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry and letter writing, for instance, became a central component of rhetorical study during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Prill, Paul E. "Rhetoric and Poetics in the Early Middle Ages." Rhetorica 5.2 (1987): 129–47. {{doi|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}. {{JSTOR|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Republic in Rome, poetry became a tool for rhetorical training since there were fewer opportunities for political speech.&lt;ref&gt;Prill, Paul E. "Rhetoric and Poetics in the Early Middle Ages." ''Rhetorica'' 5.2 (1987): 131. {{doi|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}. {{JSTOR|10.1525/rh.1987.5.2.129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Letter writing was the primary form through which business was conducted both in state and church, so it became an important aspect of rhetorical education.&lt;ref name="bedfordstmartins.com"&gt;"A Brief History of Rhetoric and Composition." ''The Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's, n.d. Web. 12 April 2010. [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/bb/history.html Bedfordstmartins.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516061220/http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/bb/history.html |date=16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical education became more restrained as style and substance separated in 16th-century France with [[Peter Ramus]], and attention turned to the scientific method. That is, influential scholars like Ramus argued that the processes of invention and arrangement should be elevated to the domain of philosophy, while rhetorical instruction should be chiefly concerned with the use of figures and other forms of the ornamentation of language. Scholars such as [[Francis Bacon]] developed the study of "scientific rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Zappen, James P. "Francis Bacon and the Historiography of Scientific Rhetoric." ''Rhetoric Review'' 8.1 (1989): 74–88. {{JSTOR|465682}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This concentration rejected the elaborate style characteristic of the classical oration.  This plain language carried over to [[John Locke]]'s teaching, which emphasized concrete knowledge and steered away from ornamentation in speech, further alienating rhetorical instruction, which was identified wholly with this ornamentation, from the pursuit of knowledge.

In the 18th century, rhetoric assumed a more social role, initiating the creation of new education systems.  "[[Elocution]] schools" arose (predominantly in England) in which females analyzed classic literature, most notably the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and discussed pronunciation tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul C. "Elocution and Shakespeare: An Episode in the History of Literary Taste." ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 35.3 (1984): 305–14. {{doi|10.2307/2870367}}. {{JSTOR|2870367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of rhetoric underwent a revival with the rise of democratic institutions during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Scotland's author and theorist [[Hugh Blair]] served as a key leader of this movement during the late 18th century.  In his most famous work "Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres", he advocates rhetorical study for common citizens as a resource for social success.  Many American colleges and secondary schools used Blair's text throughout the 19th century to train students of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;"A Brief History of Rhetoric and Composition." ''The Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's, n.d. Web. 12 April 2010.

Political rhetoric also underwent renewal in the wake of the US and French revolutions.  The rhetorical studies of ancient Greece and Rome were resurrected in the studies of the era as speakers and teachers looked to [[Cicero]] and others to inspire defense of the new republic.  Leading rhetorical theorists included [[John Quincy Adams]] of [[Harvard]] who advocated the democratic advancement of rhetorical art.  Harvard's founding of the Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory sparked the growth of rhetorical study in colleges across the United States.&lt;ref name="bedfordstmartins.com"/&gt; Harvard's rhetoric program drew inspiration from literary sources to guide organization and style. Recently, there have been studies conducted examining the rhetoric used in political speech acts to illustrate how political figures will persuade audiences for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/j_roffee_rhetoric_aboriginal_australians_2016.pdf |author=Roffee, J.

Debate clubs and lyceums also developed as forums in which common citizens could hear speakers and sharpen debate skills.  The American lyceum in particular was seen as both an educational and social institution, featuring group discussions and guest lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Angela G. The Lyceum and Public Culture in the Nineteenth-Century United States. (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 2005), 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs cultivated democratic values and promoted active participation in political analysis.

Throughout the 20th century, rhetoric developed as a concentrated field of study with the establishment of rhetorical courses in high schools and universities.  Courses such as [[public speaking]] and [[speech analysis]] apply fundamental Greek theories (such as the modes of persuasion: [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]) as well as trace rhetorical development throughout the course of history.  Rhetoric has earned a more esteemed reputation as a field of study with the emergence of [[Communication Studies]] departments as well as Rhetoric and Composition programs within English departments in universities and in conjunction with the linguistic turn.  Rhetorical study has broadened in scope, and is especially utilized by the fields of marketing, politics, and literature.

Rhetoric, as an area of study, is concerned with how humans use symbols, especially language, to reach agreement that permits coordinated effort of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hauser| first = Gerard| authorlink = Gerard Hauser| title = Introduction to Rhetorical Theory| publisher = [[Waveland Press]]| location = Illinois| year = 2002| page = 2|isbn = 978-1-57766-221-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], the first university in the United States, based on the European model, taught a basic curriculum, including rhetoric.  Rhetoric, in this sense, how to properly give speeches, played an important role in their training. Rhetoric was soon taught in departments of English as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Borchers | first1 = Timothy A. | title = Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction (with InfoTrac) | year = 2006  | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = Canada | isbn = 0-534-63918-6 | page = 21  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge===
The relationship between rhetoric and knowledge is an old and interesting philosophical problem, partly because of our different assumptions on the nature of knowledge. But it is fairly clear that while knowledge is primarily concerned with what is commonly known as "truth", rhetoric is primarily concerned with statements and their effects on the audience. The word "rhetoric" may also refer to "empty speak", which reflects an indifference to truth, and in this sense rhetoric is adversarial to knowledge. Plato famously criticized the Sophists for their rhetoric which had persuaded people to sentence his friend Socrates to death regardless of what was true. However, rhetoric is also used in the construction of true arguments, or in identifying what is relevant, the crux of the matter, in a selection of true but otherwise trivial statements. Hence, rhetoric is also closely related to knowledge.

The [[Egyptians]] held eloquent speaking in high esteem, and it was a skill that had a very high value in their society. The "Egyptian rules of rhetoric" also clearly specified that "knowing when not to speak is essential, and very respected, rhetorical knowledge". Their "approach to rhetoric" was thus a "balance between eloquence and wise silence". Their rules of speech also strongly emphasized "adherence to social behaviors that support a conservative status quo" and they held that "skilled speech should support, not question, society".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Ancient Egyptian Rhetoric in the Old and Middle Kingdoms |author=David Hutto‌ |journal=[[Rhetorica]] |date=Summer 2002| volume=20| issue=3| publisher=[[University of California Press]]| pages=213–33| doi=10.1525/rh.2002.20.3.213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient China]], rhetoric dates back to the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BC), and continued with later followers.

In [[ancient Greece]], the earliest mention of oratorical skill occurs in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', where heroes like [[Achilles]], [[Hector]], and [[Odysseus]] were honored for their ability to advise and exhort their peers and followers (the ''Laos'' or army) in wise and appropriate action.  With the rise of the democratic ''polis'', speaking skill was adapted to the needs of the public and political life of cities in ancient Greece, much of which revolved around the use of [[oratory (speech)|oratory]] as the medium through which political and judicial decisions were made, and through which philosophical ideas were developed and disseminated.  For modern students today, it can be difficult to remember that the wide use and availability of written texts is a phenomenon that was just coming into vogue in [[Classical Greece]].  In Classical times, many of the great thinkers and political leaders performed their works before an audience, usually in the context of a competition or contest for fame, political influence, and cultural capital; in fact, many of them are known only through the texts that their students, followers, or detractors wrote down.  As has already been noted, ''rhetor'' was the Greek term for ''orator:''  A ''rhetor'' was a citizen who regularly addressed juries and political assemblies and who was thus understood to have gained some knowledge about public speaking in the process, though in general facility with language was often referred to as ''logôn techne'', "skill with arguments" or "verbal artistry".&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes (Blackwell, 1991); Josiah Ober ''Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens'' (Princeton UP, 1989); Jeffrey Walker, "Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity;" (Oxford UP, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetoric thus evolved as an important art, one that provided the orator with the forms, means, and strategies for persuading an audience of the correctness of the orator's arguments. Today the term ''rhetoric'' can be used at times to refer only to the form of argumentation, often with the pejorative connotation that rhetoric is a means of obscuring the truth. Classical [[philosopher]]s believed quite the contrary: the skilled use of rhetoric was essential to the discovery of truths, because it provided the means of ordering and clarifying arguments.

===Sophists===
{{Main|Sophist|l1=Sophists}}
In Europe, organized thought about public speaking began in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kennedy, G.A. (1994). A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton University Press. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the first study about the power of language may be attributed to the philosopher [[Empedocles]] (d. c. 444 BC), whose theories on human knowledge would provide a newfound basis for many future rhetoricians. The first written manual is attributed to [[Corax of Syracuse|Corax]] and his pupil [[Tisias]]. Their work, as well as that of many of the early rhetoricians, grew out of the courts of law; Tisias, for example, is believed to have written judicial speeches that others delivered in the courts. Teaching in oratory was popularized in the 5th century BC by itinerant teachers known as [[sophist]]s, the best known of whom were [[Protagoras]] (c. 481–420 BC), [[Gorgias]] (c. 483–376 BC), and [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC). Aspasia of Miletus&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspasia|date=2018-10-15|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspasia&amp;oldid=864170801|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be one of the first women to engage in private and public rhetoric activities as a Sophist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetorical tradition: readings from classical times to the present|date=1990|publisher=Bedford Books of St. Martin's Press|editor1-last=Bizzell|editor1-first=Patricia|editor2-last=Herzberg|editor2-first=Bruce|isbn=031200348X|location=Boston|oclc=21325600}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sophists were a disparate group who travelled from city to city, teaching in public places to attract students and offer them an education. Their central focus was on [[logos]] or what we might broadly refer to as discourse, its functions and powers. They defined parts of speech, analyzed poetry, parsed close synonyms, invented argumentation strategies, and debated the nature of reality. They claimed to make their students "better", or, in other words, to teach virtue. They thus claimed that human "excellence" was not an accident of fate or a prerogative of noble birth, but an art or "''techne''" that could be taught and learned. They were thus among the first humanists. Several sophists also questioned received wisdom about the gods and the Greek culture, which they believed was taken for granted by Greeks of their time, making them among the first agnostics. For example, they argued that cultural practices were a function of convention or ''[[Law|nomos]]'' rather than blood or birth or ''phusis''. They argued even further that morality or immorality of any action could not be judged outside of the cultural context within which it occurred. The well-known phrase, "Man is the measure of all things" arises from this belief. One of their most famous, and infamous, doctrines has to do with probability and counter arguments. They taught that every argument could be countered with an opposing argument, that an argument's effectiveness derived from how "likely" it appeared to the audience (its probability of seeming true), and that any probability argument could be countered with an inverted probability argument. Thus, if it seemed likely that a strong, poor man were guilty of robbing a rich, weak man, the strong poor man could argue, on the contrary, that this very likelihood (that he would be a suspect) makes it unlikely that he committed the crime, since he would most likely be apprehended for the crime. They also taught and were known for their ability to make the weaker (or worse) argument the stronger (or better).  [[Aristophanes]] famously parodies the clever inversions that sophists were known for in his play ''The Clouds''.

The word "sophistry" developed strong negative connotations in ancient Greece that continue today, but in ancient Greece sophists were nevertheless popular and well-paid professionals, widely respected for their abilities but also widely criticized for their excesses.

===Isocrates===
{{Main|Isocrates }}
Isocrates (436–338 BC), like the sophists, taught public speaking as a means of human improvement, but he worked to distinguish himself from the Sophists, whom he saw as claiming far more than they could deliver. He suggested that while an art of virtue or excellence did exist, it was only one piece, and the least, in a process of self-improvement that relied much more heavily on native talent and desire, constant practice, and the imitation of good models. Isocrates believed that practice in speaking publicly about noble themes and important questions would function to improve the character of both speaker and audience while also offering the best service to a city. In fact, Isocrates was an outspoken champion of rhetoric as a mode of civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. "Against the Sophists." In ''Isocrates with an English Translation in three volumes'', by George Norlin, PhD, LL.D. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1980.; Isocrates. "Antidosis." In ''Isocrates with an English Translation in three volumes'', by George Norlin, PhD, LL.D. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus wrote his speeches as "models" for his students to imitate in the same way that poets might imitate Homer or Hesiod, seeking to inspire in them a desire to attain fame through civic leadership. His was the first permanent school in [[Athens]] and it is likely that [[Plato's Academy]] and [[Aristotle's Lyceum]] were founded in part as a response to Isocrates. Though he left no handbooks, his speeches (''"Antidosis"'' and ''"Against the Sophists"'' are most relevant to students of rhetoric) became models of oratory (he was one of the canonical "[[Ten Attic Orators]]") and keys to his entire educational program. He had a marked influence on [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], and through them, on the entire educational system of the west.

===Plato===
{{Main|Plato|Platonism}}
[[Plato]] (427–347 BC) famously outlined the differences between true and false rhetoric in a number of dialogues; particularly the ''Gorgias'' and ''Phaedrus'' dialogues wherein Plato disputes the sophistic notion that the art of persuasion (the sophists' art, which he calls "rhetoric"), can exist independent of the art of dialectic. Plato claims that since sophists appeal only to what seems probable, they are not advancing their students and audiences, but simply flattering them with what they want to hear. While Plato's condemnation of rhetoric is clear in the ''Gorgias'', in the ''Phaedrus'' he suggests the possibility of a true art wherein rhetoric is based upon the knowledge produced by dialectic, and relies on a dialectically informed rhetoric to appeal to the main character, Phaedrus, to take up philosophy. Thus Plato's rhetoric is actually dialectic (or philosophy) "turned" toward those who are not yet philosophers and are thus unready to pursue dialectic directly.  Plato's animosity against rhetoric, and against the sophists, derives not only from their inflated claims to teach virtue and their reliance on appearances, but from the fact that his teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death after sophists' efforts.

===Aristotle===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
{{Main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A marble bust of Aristotle]]
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) was a student of Plato who famously set forth an extended treatise on rhetoric that still repays careful study today. In the first sentence of [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Art of Rhetoric]], Aristotle says that "rhetoric is the counterpart [literally, the [[antistrophe]]] of dialectic".&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Rhetoric'' Book I Chapter 1 [1354a] {{cite web |url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201141/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the "antistrophe" of a Greek [[ode]] responds to and is patterned after the structure of the "[[strophe]]" (they form two sections of the whole and are sung by two parts of the chorus), so the art of rhetoric follows and is structurally patterned after the art of dialectic because both are arts of discourse production. Thus, while dialectical methods are necessary to find truth in theoretical matters, rhetorical methods are required in practical matters such as adjudicating somebody's guilt or innocence when charged in a court of law, or adjudicating a prudent course of action to be taken in a deliberative assembly. The core features of dialectic include the absence of determined subject matter, its elaboration on earlier empirical practice, the explication of its aims, the type of utility and the definition of the proper function.

For Plato and Aristotle, dialectic involves persuasion, so when Aristotle says that rhetoric is the antistrophe of dialectic, he means that rhetoric as he uses the term has a domain or scope of application that is parallel to, but different from, the domain or scope of application of dialectic. In ''Nietzsche Humanist'' (1998: 129), Claude Pavur explains that "[t]he Greek prefix 'anti' does not merely designate opposition, but it can also mean 'in place of.'"  When Aristotle characterizes rhetoric as the antistrophe of dialectic, he no doubt means that rhetoric is used in place of dialectic when we are discussing civic issues in a court of law or in a legislative assembly. The domain of rhetoric is civic affairs and practical decision making in civic affairs, not theoretical considerations of operational definitions of terms and clarification of thought. These, for him, are in the domain of dialectic.

Aristotle's treatise on rhetoric systematically describes civic rhetoric as a human art or skill (techne). It is more of an objective theory than it is an interpretive theory with a rhetorical tradition. Aristotle's art of rhetoric emphasizes persuasion as the purpose of rhetoric. His definition of rhetoric as "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion", essentially a mode of discovery, limits the art to the inventional process, and Aristotle heavily emphasizes the logical aspect of this process. In his account, rhetoric is the art of discovering all available means of persuasion. A speaker supports the probability of a message by logical, ethical, and emotional proofs. Some form of logos, ethos, and pathos is present in every possible public presentation that exists. But the treatise in fact also discusses not only elements of style and (briefly) delivery, but also emotional appeals (pathos) and characterological appeals (ethos).

Aristotle identifies three steps or "offices" of rhetoric—invention, arrangement, and style—and three different types of rhetorical proof: [[ethos]] (Aristotle's theory of character and how the character and credibility of a speaker can influence an audience to consider him/her to be believable—there being three qualities that contribute to a credible ethos: perceived intelligence, virtuous character, and goodwill);&lt;ref&gt;Note:This could be any position in which the speaker—whether an acknowledged expert on the subject, or an acquaintance of a person who experienced the matter in question—knows about the topic. For instance, when a magazine claims that ''An [[MIT]] professor predicts that the robotic era is coming in 2050,'' the use of big-name "MIT" (a world-renowned American university for the advanced research in mathematics, science, and technology) establishes the "strong" credibility.&lt;/ref&gt; [[pathos]] (the use of emotional appeals to alter the audience's judgment through metaphor, amplification, storytelling, or presenting the topic in a way that evokes strong emotions in the audience.); and, [[logos]] (the use of reasoning, either [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] or [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], to construct an argument).

Aristotle emphasized ''[[Deductive reasoning|enthymematic reasoning]]'' as central to the process of rhetorical invention, though later rhetorical theorists placed much less emphasis on it.  An "enthymeme" would follow today's form of a syllogism; however it would exclude either the major or minor premise. An enthymeme is persuasive because the audience is providing the missing premise.  Because the audience is able to provide the missing premise, they are more likely to be persuaded by the message.

Aristotle identified three different types or genres of civic rhetoric.  ''[[Forensic]]'' (also known as judicial), was concerned with determining the truth or falseness of events that took place in the past and issues of guilt.  An example of forensic rhetoric would be in a courtroom.  ''[[Deliberative]]'' (also known as political), was concerned with determining whether or not particular actions should or should not be taken in the future. Making laws would be an example of deliberative rhetoric.  ''[[Epideictic]]'' (also known as ceremonial), was concerned with praise and blame, values, right and wrong, demonstrating beauty and skill in the present.  Examples of epideictic rhetoric would include a eulogy or a wedding toast.

==Canons==
The Five Canons of Rhetoric serve as a guide to creating persuasive messages and arguments.  These are [[inventio]]n (the process of developing arguments); [[Dispositio|arrangement]] (organizing the arguments for extreme effect); [[Elocutio|style]] (determining how to present the arguments); [[Memoria|memory]] (the process of learning and memorizing the speech and persuasive messages), and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]] (the gestures, pronunciation, tone and pace used when presenting the persuasive arguments).&lt;ref&gt;Note: Memory was added much later to the original four canons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rhetoric field, there is an intellectual debate about Aristotle's definition of rhetoric. Some believe that Aristotle defines rhetoric in ''On Rhetoric'' as the art of persuasion, while others think he defines it as the art of judgment. Rhetoric as the art of judgment would mean the rhetor discerns the available means of persuasion with a choice. Aristotle also says rhetoric is concerned with judgment because the audience judges the rhetor's ethos.

One of the most famous of Aristotelian doctrines was the idea of topics (also referred to as [[The Common Topics|common topics]] or commonplaces). Though the term had a wide range of application (as a memory technique or compositional exercise, for example) it most often referred to the "seats of argument"—the list of categories of thought or modes of reasoning—that a speaker could use to generate arguments or proofs. The topics were thus a heuristic or inventional tool designed to help speakers categorize and thus better retain and apply frequently used types of argument. For example, since we often see effects as "like" their causes, one way to invent an argument (about a future effect) is by discussing the cause (which it will be "like"). This and other rhetorical topics derive from Aristotle's belief that there are certain predictable ways in which humans (particularly non-specialists) draw conclusions from premises. Based upon and adapted from his dialectical Topics, the rhetorical topics became a central feature of later rhetorical theorizing, most famously in Cicero's work of that name.

===Cicero===
{{Main|Cicero|Asiatic style|De Inventione|De Oratore|Brutus (Cicero)|De Optimo Genere Oratorum|De Partitionibus Oratoriae}}
[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bust of Marcus Tullius Cicero]]
For the Romans, oration became an important part of public life. [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) was chief among Roman rhetoricians and remains the best known ancient orator and the only orator who both spoke in public and produced treatises on the subject. ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', formerly attributed to Cicero but now considered to be of unknown authorship, is one of the most significant works on rhetoric and is still widely used as a reference today. It is an extensive reference on the use of rhetoric, and in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], it achieved wide publication as an advanced school text on rhetoric.

Cicero is considered one of the most significant rhetoricians of all time, charting a middle path between the competing Attic and [[Asiatic style]]s to become considered second only to [[Demosthenes]] among history's orators.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, Cicero: Philippics 3–9, vol. 2, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2007, pp. 129ff&lt;/ref&gt; His works include the early and very influential [[De Inventione]] (On Invention, often read alongside the ''Ad Herennium'' as the two basic texts of rhetorical theory throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance), [[De Oratore]] (a fuller statement of rhetorical principles in dialogue form), [[Topics (Cicero)|Topics]] (a rhetorical treatment of common topics, highly influential through the Renaissance), [[Brutus (Cicero)]] (a discussion of famous orators) and [[Orator (Cicero)|Orator]] (a defense of Cicero's style). Cicero also left a large body of speeches and letters which would establish the outlines of Latin eloquence and style for generations to come. It was the rediscovery of Cicero's speeches (such as the defense of Archias) and letters (to Atticus) by Italians like [[Petrarch]] that, in part, ignited the cultural innovations that we know as the Renaissance.  He championed the learning of Greek (and Greek rhetoric), contributed to Roman ethics, linguistics, philosophy, and politics, and emphasized the importance of all forms of appeal (emotion, humor, stylistic range, irony and digression in addition to pure reasoning) in oratory. But perhaps his most significant contribution to subsequent rhetoric, and education in general, was his argument that orators learn not only about the specifics of their case (the ''hypothesis'') but also about the general questions from which they derived (the ''theses'').  Thus, in giving a speech in defense of a poet whose Roman citizenship had been questioned, the orator should examine not only the specifics of that poet's civic status, he should also examine the role and value of poetry and of literature more generally in Roman culture and political life.  The orator, said Cicero, needed to be knowledgeable about all areas of human life and culture, including law, politics, history, literature, ethics, warfare, medicine, even arithmetic and geometry. Cicero gave rise to the idea that the "ideal orator" be well-versed in all branches of learning: an idea that was rendered as "liberal humanism", and that lives on today in liberal arts or general education requirements in colleges and universities around the world.

===Quintilian===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
{{Main|Quintilian|Byzantine rhetoric}}
Quintilian (35–100 AD) began his career as a pleader in the courts of law; his reputation grew so great that [[Vespasian]] created a chair of rhetoric for him in Rome. The culmination of his life's work was the ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (''Institutes of Oratory,'' or alternatively, ''The Orator's Education''), a lengthy treatise on the training of the orator, in which he discusses the training of the "perfect" orator from birth to old age and, in the process, reviews the doctrines and opinions of many influential rhetoricians who preceded him.

In the Institutes, Quintilian organizes rhetorical study through the stages of education that an aspiring orator would undergo, beginning with the selection of a nurse. Aspects of elementary education (training in reading and writing, grammar, and literary criticism) are followed by preliminary rhetorical exercises in composition (the [[progymnasmata]]) that include maxims and fables, narratives and comparisons, and finally full legal or political speeches. The delivery of speeches within the context of education or for entertainment purposes became widespread and popular under the term "declamation". Rhetorical training proper was categorized under five canons that would persist for centuries in academic circles:
* ''[[Inventio]]'' (invention) is the process that leads to the development and refinement of an argument.
* Once arguments are developed, ''[[dispositio]]'' (disposition, or arrangement) is used to determine how it should be organized for greatest effect, usually beginning with the ''[[exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''.
* Once the speech content is known and the structure is determined, the next steps involve ''[[elocutio]]'' (style) and ''[[pronuntiatio]]'' (presentation).
* ''[[Memoria]]'' (memory) comes to play as the speaker recalls each of these elements during the speech.
* ''[[Actio]]'' (delivery) is the final step as the speech is presented in a gracious and pleasing way to the audience&amp;nbsp;– the [[Grand Style]].

This work was available only in fragments in medieval times, but the discovery of a complete copy at the [[Abbey of St. Gall]] in 1416 led to its emergence as one of the most influential works on rhetoric during the Renaissance.

Quintilian's work describes not just the art of rhetoric, but the formation of the perfect orator as a politically active, virtuous, publicly minded citizen. His emphasis was on the ethical application of rhetorical training, in part a reaction against the growing tendency in Roman schools toward standardization of themes and techniques. At the same time that rhetoric was becoming divorced from political decision making, rhetoric rose as a culturally vibrant and important mode of entertainment and cultural criticism in a movement known as the "second sophistic", a development that gave rise to the charge (made by Quintilian and others) that teachers were emphasizing style over substance in rhetoric.

===Medieval to Enlightenment===
After the breakup of the western Roman Empire, the study of rhetoric continued to be central to the study of the verbal arts; but the study of the verbal arts went into decline for several centuries, followed eventually by a gradual rise in formal education, culminating in the rise of medieval universities. But rhetoric transmuted during this period into the arts of letter writing (''[[ars dictaminis]]'') and sermon writing (''ars praedicandi''). As part of the ''[[trivium (education)|trivium]]'', rhetoric was secondary to the study of logic, and its study was highly scholastic: students were given repetitive exercises in the creation of discourses on historical subjects (''suasoriae'') or on classic legal questions (''controversiae'').

Although he is not commonly regarded as a rhetorician, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (354–430) was trained in rhetoric and was at one time a professor of Latin rhetoric in Milan. After his conversion to Christianity, he became interested in using these "[[Paganism|pagan]]" arts for spreading his religion. This new use of rhetoric is explored in the Fourth Book of his ''De Doctrina Christiana'', which laid the foundation of what would become [[homiletics]], the rhetoric of the sermon. Augustine begins the book by asking why "the power of eloquence, which is so efficacious in pleading either for the erroneous cause or the right", should not be used for righteous purposes (IV. 3).

One early concern of the medieval Christian church was its attitude to classical rhetoric itself. [[Jerome]] (d. 420) complained, "What has [[Horace]] to do with the Psalms, [[Virgil]] with the Gospels, Cicero with the Apostles?" Augustine is also remembered for arguing for the preservation of pagan works and fostering a church tradition that led to conservation of numerous pre-Christian rhetorical writings.

Rhetoric would not regain its classical heights until the Renaissance, but new writings did advance rhetorical thought. [[Boethius]] (480?–524), in his brief ''Overview of the Structure of Rhetoric'', continues Aristotle's taxonomy by placing rhetoric in subordination to philosophical argument or dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg ''The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present'', Boston: Bedford / St. Martins, 2nd ed., 2001, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|introduction of Arab scholarship]] from European relations with the [[Caliphate|Muslim empire]] (in particular [[Al-Andalus]]) renewed interest in Aristotle and Classical thought in general, leading to what some historians call the 12th century Renaissance. A number of medieval grammars and studies of poetry and rhetoric appeared.

Late medieval rhetorical writings include those of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225?–1274), [[Matthew of Vendome]] (''Ars Versificatoria'', 1175?), and [[Geoffrey of Vinsauf]] (''Poetria Nova'', 1200–1216). Pre-modern female rhetoricians, outside of Socrates' friend [[Aspasia]], are rare; but medieval rhetoric produced by women either in religious orders, such as [[Julian of Norwich]] (d. 1415), or the very well-connected [[Christine de Pizan]] (1364?–1430?), did occur if not always recorded in writing.

In his 1943 [[Cambridge University]] doctoral dissertation in English, Canadian [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) surveys the verbal arts from approximately the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]] (1567–1600?).&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's dissertation was scheduled to be published in a critical edition by Gingko Press in April 2006 with the title ''The Classical Trivium: The Place of Thomas Nashe in the Learning of His Time''.&lt;/ref&gt;  His dissertation is still noteworthy for undertaking to study the history of the verbal arts together as the trivium, even though the developments that he surveys have been studied in greater detail since he undertook his study. As noted below, McLuhan became one of the most widely publicized thinkers in the 20th century, so it is important to note his scholarly roots in the study of the history of rhetoric and dialectic.

Another interesting record of medieval rhetorical thought can be seen in the many [[medieval debate literature|animal debate poems]] popular in England and the continent during the Middle Ages, such as [[The Owl and the Nightingale]] (13th century) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Parliament of Fowls]] (1382?).

===Sixteenth century===
Walter J. Ong's article "Humanism" in the 1967 ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' surveys [[Renaissance humanism]], which defined itself broadly as disfavoring medieval scholastic logic and dialectic and as favoring instead the study of classical Latin style and grammar and philology and rhetoric. (Reprinted in Ong's ''Faith and Contexts'' (Scholars Press, 1999; 4: 69–91.))
[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]
One influential figure in the rebirth of interest in classical rhetoric was [[Erasmus]] (c. 1466–1536). His 1512 work, ''De Duplici Copia Verborum et Rerum'' (also known as ''[[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style]]''), was widely published (it went through more than 150 editions throughout Europe) and became one of the basic school texts on the subject. Its treatment of rhetoric is less comprehensive than the classic works of antiquity, but provides a traditional treatment of ''res-verba'' (matter and form): its first book treats the subject of [[elocutio]], showing the student how to use [[figure of speech|schemes and tropes]]; the second book covers [[inventio]]. Much of the emphasis is on abundance of variation (''copia'' means "plenty" or "abundance", as in copious or cornucopia), so both books focus on ways to introduce the maximum amount of variety into discourse. For instance, in one section of the ''De Copia'', Erasmus presents two hundred variations of the sentence "{{lang|la|Semper, dum vivam, tui meminero.}}" Another of his works, the extremely popular [[The Praise of Folly]], also had considerable influence on the teaching of rhetoric in the later 16th century. Its orations in favour of qualities such as madness spawned a type of exercise popular in Elizabethan grammar schools, later called [[adoxography]], which required pupils to compose passages in praise of useless things.

[[Juan Luis Vives]] (1492–1540) also helped shape the study of rhetoric in England. A Spaniard, he was appointed in 1523 to the Lectureship of Rhetoric at Oxford by [[Cardinal Wolsey]], and was entrusted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to be one of the tutors of Mary. Vives fell into disfavor when Henry VIII divorced [[Catherine of Aragon]] and left England in 1528. His best-known work was a book on education, ''De Disciplinis'', published in 1531, and his writings on rhetoric included ''Rhetoricae, sive De Ratione Dicendi, Libri Tres'' (1533), ''De Consultatione'' (1533), and a rhetoric on letter writing, ''De Conscribendis Epistolas'' (1536).

It is likely that many well-known English writers were exposed to the works of [[Erasmus]] and [[Juan Luis Vives|Vives]] (as well as those of the Classical rhetoricians) in their schooling, which was conducted in Latin (not English) and often included some study of Greek and placed considerable emphasis on rhetoric. See, for example, T.W. Baldwin's ''William Shakspere's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 2 vols. (University of Illinois Press, 1944).

The mid-16th century saw the rise of vernacular rhetorics—those written in English rather than in the Classical languages; adoption of works in English was slow, however, due to the strong orientation toward Latin and Greek. [[Leonard Cox]]'s ''The Art or Crafte of Rhetoryke'' (c. 1524–1530; second edition published in 1532) is considered to be the earliest text on rhetorics in English; it was, for the most part, a translation of the work of [[Melanchthon|Philipp Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Ives Carpenter, "Leonard Cox and the First English Rhetoric," ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 13, No. 5 (May 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;146–47. {{doi|10.2307/2917751}}. {{JSTOR|2917751}}&amp;nbsp;–  subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; A successful early text was [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]]'s ''The Arte of Rhetorique'' (1553), which presents a traditional treatment of rhetoric. For instance, Wilson presents the five canons of rhetoric (Invention, Disposition, [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and Utterance or [[Actio]]). Other notable works included Angel Day's ''The English Secretorie'' (1586, 1592), [[George Puttenham]]'s ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589), and [[Richard Rainholde]]'s ''Foundacion of Rhetorike'' (1563).

During this same period, a movement began that would change the organization of the school curriculum in Protestant and especially Puritan circles and led to rhetoric losing its central place. A French scholar, Pierre de la Ramée, in Latin [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515–1572), dissatisfied with what he saw as the overly broad and redundant organization of the [[trivium (education)|trivium]], proposed a new curriculum. In his scheme of things, the five components of rhetoric no longer lived under the common heading of rhetoric. Instead, invention and disposition were determined to fall exclusively under the heading of dialectic, while style, delivery, and memory were all that remained for rhetoric. See [[Walter J. Ong]], ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason'' (Harvard University Press, 1958; reissued by the University of Chicago Press, 2004, with a new foreword by Adrian Johns). Ramus was martyred during the French Wars of Religion. His teachings, seen as inimical to Catholicism, were short-lived in France but found a fertile ground in the Netherlands, Germany and England.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Marc Fumaroli]], ''Age de l'Éloquence'', 1980, for an extensive presentation of the intricate political and religious debates concerning rhetoric in France and Italy at the time&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Ramus' French followers, [[Audomarus Talaeus]] (Omer Talon) published his rhetoric, ''Institutiones Oratoriae'', in 1544. This work provided a simple presentation of rhetoric that emphasized the treatment of style, and became so popular that it was mentioned in [[John Brinsley the elder|John Brinsley]]'s (1612) ''Ludus literarius; or The Grammar Schoole'' as being the "most used in the best schooles". Many other [[Ramist]] rhetorics followed in the next half-century, and by the 17th century, their approach became the primary method of teaching rhetoric in Protestant and especially Puritan circles.&lt;ref&gt;See Walter J. Ong, ''Ramus and Talon Inventory'' (Harvard University Press, 1958); Joseph S. Freedman, ''Philosophy and the Art Europe, 1500–1700: Teaching and Texts at Schools and Universities'' (Ashgate, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Milton]] (1608–1674) wrote a textbook in logic or dialectic in Latin based on Ramus' work.&lt;ref&gt;Which has now been translated into English by Walter J. Ong and Charles J. Ermatinger in ''The Complete Prose Works of John Milton'' (Yale University Press, 1982; 8: 206–407), with a lengthy introduction by Ong (pp. 144–205). The introduction is reprinted in Ong's ''Faith and Contexts'' (Scholars Press, 1999; 4: 111–141).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramism could not exert any influence on the established Catholic schools and universities, which remained loyal to Scholasticism, or on the new Catholic schools and universities founded by members of the religious orders known as the [[Society of Jesus]] or the Oratorians, as can be seen in the [[Jesuit]] curriculum (in use right up to the 19th century, across the Christian world) known as the [[Ratio Studiorum]] (that Claude Pavur, S.J., has recently translated into English, with the Latin text in the parallel column on each page (St. Louis: Institute of Jesuit Sources, 2005)). If the influence of Cicero and Quintilian permeates the [[Ratio Studiorum]], it is through the lenses of devotion and the militancy of the Counter-Reformation. The ''Ratio'' was indeed imbued with a sense of the divine, of the incarnate logos, that is of rhetoric as an eloquent and humane means to reach further devotion and further action in the Christian city, which was absent from Ramist formalism. The Ratio is, in rhetoric, the answer to St Ignatius Loyola's practice, in devotion, of "spiritual exercises". This complex oratorical-prayer system is absent from Ramism.

===Seventeenth century===
In New England and at [[Harvard College]] (founded 1636), Ramus and his followers dominated, as [[Perry Miller]] shows in ''The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century'' (Harvard University Press, 1939). However, in England, several writers influenced the course of rhetoric during the 17th century, many of them carrying forward the dichotomy that had been set forth by Ramus and his followers during the preceding decades. Of greater importance is that this century saw the development of a modern, vernacular style that looked to English, rather than to Greek, Latin, or French models.

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), although not a rhetorician, contributed to the field in his writings. One of the concerns of the age was to find a suitable style for the discussion of scientific topics, which needed above all a clear exposition of facts and arguments, rather than the ornate style favored at the time. Bacon in his ''The Advancement of Learning'' criticized those who are preoccupied with style rather than "the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment". On matters of style, he proposed that the style conform to the subject matter and to the audience, that simple words be employed whenever possible, and that the style should be agreeable.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lisa Jardine]], ''Francis Bacon: Discovery and the Art of Discourse'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) also wrote on rhetoric. Along with a shortened translation of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Rhetoric'', Hobbes also produced a number of other works on the subject. Sharply contrarian on many subjects, Hobbes, like Bacon, also promoted a simpler and more natural style that used figures of speech sparingly.

Perhaps the most influential development in English style came out of the work of the [[Royal Society]] (founded in 1660), which in 1664 set up a committee to improve the English language. Among the committee's members were [[John Evelyn]] (1620–1706), [[Thomas Sprat]] (1635–1713), and [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700). Sprat regarded "fine speaking" as a disease, and thought that a proper style should "reject all amplifications, digressions, and swellings of style" and instead "return back to a primitive purity and shortness" (''History of the Royal Society'', 1667).

While the work of this committee never went beyond planning, John Dryden is often credited with creating and exemplifying a new and modern English style. His central tenet was that the style should be proper "to the occasion, the subject, and the persons". As such, he advocated the use of English words whenever possible instead of foreign ones, as well as vernacular, rather than Latinate, syntax. His own prose (and his poetry) became exemplars of this new style.

===Eighteenth century===
Arguably one of the most influential schools of rhetoric during this time was Scottish Belletristic rhetoric, exemplified by such professors of rhetoric as [[Hugh Blair]] whose [[Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres]] saw international success in various editions and translations.

==Modern==
At the turn of the 20th century, there was a revival of rhetorical study manifested in the establishment of departments of rhetoric and speech at academic institutions, as well as the formation of national and international professional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Histories of the emergence of rhetorical studies in 20th-century America can be found in Cohen, H. (1994). ''The history of speech communication: The emergence of a discipline, 1914–1945''. Annandale, VA: Speech Communication Association; and Gehrke, P.J. (2009). ''The ethics and politics of speech: Communication and rhetoric in the twentieth century''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jim A. Kuypers]] and Andrew King suggest that the early interest in rhetorical studies was a movement away from elocution as taught in departments of English in the United States, and was an attempt to refocus rhetorical studies away from delivery only to civic engagement. Collectively, they write, twentieth century rhetorical studies offered an understanding of rhetoric that demonstrated a "rich complexity" of how rhetorical scholars understood the nature of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers and Andrew King, ''Twentieth-Century Roots of Rhetorical Studies'' (Westpost, CT: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists generally agree that by the 1930s a significant reason for the revival of the study of rhetoric was the renewed importance of language and persuasion in the increasingly mediated environment of the 20th century (see [[Linguistic turn]]) and through the 21st century, with the media focus on the wide variations and analyses of political rhetoric and its consequences. The rise of [[advertising]] and of [[mass media]] such as [[photography]], [[telegraphy]], [[radio]], and [[film]] brought rhetoric more prominently into people's lives. More recently the term rhetoric has been applied to media forms other than verbal language, e.g. [[Visual rhetoric]].

===Notable modern theorists===
* '''[[Chaïm Perelman]]''' was a philosopher of law, who studied, taught, and lived most of his life in Brussels. He was among the most important [[argumentation theory|argumentation]] theorists of the 20th century. His chief work is the ''Traité de l'argumentation&amp;nbsp;– la nouvelle rhétorique'' (1958), with [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]], which was translated into English as ''The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation'', by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver (1969). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca move rhetoric from the periphery to the center of argumentation theory. Among their most influential concepts are "dissociation", "the universal audience", "quasi-logical argument", and "presence".
* '''[[Kenneth Burke]]''' was a rhetorical theorist, philosopher, and poet. Many of his works are central to modern rhetorical theory: ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950), ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1945), ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), and ''Counterstatement'' (1931). Among his influential concepts are "identification", "consubstantiality", and the "dramatistic pentad". He described rhetoric as "the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Borchers | first1 = Timothy A. | title = Rhetorical theory: an introduction | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Thomson/Wadsworth]] | location = Belmont, CA| isbn = 0-534-63918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Aristotle's theory, Aristotle was more interested in constructing rhetoric, while Burke was interested in "debunking" it.
* '''[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black]]''' was a rhetorical critic best known for his book ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method''&lt;ref&gt;Black, Edwin. (1965) ''Rhetorical Criticism a Study in Method.'' Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1965) in which he criticized the dominant "neo-Aristotelian" tradition in American [[rhetorical criticism]] as having little in common with Aristotle "besides some recurrent topics of discussion and a vaguely derivative view of rhetorical discourse". Furthermore, he contended, because rhetorical scholars had been focusing primarily on Aristotelian logical forms they often overlooked important, alternative types of discourse. He also published several highly influential essays including: "Secrecy and Disclosure as Rhetorical Forms",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1988 | title = Secrecy and Disclosure as Rhetorical Forms | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 74 | issue = 2| page = 133 | doi=10.1080/00335638809383833}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Second Persona",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1970 | title = The Second Persona | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 56 | issue = 2| page = 109 | doi=10.1080/00335637009382992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "A Note on Theory and Practice in Rhetorical Criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black, Edwin | year = 1980 | title = A Note on Theory and Practice in Rhetorical Criticism | journal = Western Journal of Speech Communication: WJSC | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 331–36 | doi=10.1080/10570318009374018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Marshall McLuhan]]''' was a media theorist whose theories and whose choice of objects of study are important to the study of rhetoric. McLuhan's famous dictum "the medium is the message" highlights the significance of the medium itself. No other scholar of the history and theory of rhetoric was as widely publicized in the 20th century as McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;When McLuhan was working on his 1943 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation on the verbal arts and Nashe, he was also preparing the materials for his book ''The Mechanical Bride: The Folklore of Industrial Man'' (Vanguard Press, 1951). This was a compilation of exhibits of ads and other materials from popular culture with short essays involving rhetorical analyses of the ways in which the material in an item aims to persuade and comment on the persuasive strategies in each item.  McLuhan later shifted the focus of his rhetorical analysis and began to consider how communication media themselves affect us as persuasive devices.  McLuhan expresses this insight when he says "[[The medium is the message]]". This shift in focus from his 1951 book led to his two most widely known books, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man'' (University of Toronto Press, 1962) and ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' (McGraw-Hill, 1964)'; these books represent an inward turn to attending to one's consciousness in contrast to the more outward orientation of other rhetoricians toward sociological considerations and symbolic interaction.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[I. A. Richards]]''' was a literary critic and rhetorician. His ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' is an important text in modern rhetorical theory. In this work, he defined rhetoric as "a study of misunderstandings and its remedies",&lt;ref&gt;Richards, I. A. (1965) ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the influential concepts ''tenor'' and ''vehicle'' to describe the components of a metaphor—the main idea and the concept to which it is compared.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, I. A. (1965) ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' New York: Oxford. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The [[Groupe µ]]'''. This interdisciplinary team has contributed to the renovation of the elocutio in the context of poetics and modern linguistics, significantly with ''Rhétorique générale'' (1970; translated into English as ''A General Rhetoric'', by Paul B. Burrell et Edgar M. Slotkin, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981) and ''Rhétorique de la poésie'' (1977).
* '''[[Stephen Toulmin]]''' was a philosopher whose models of argumentation have had great influence on modern rhetorical theory. His ''Uses of Argument'' is an important text in modern rhetorical theory and [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Stephen| last=Toulmin| authorlink= Stephen Toulmin| year=2003| title= The Uses of Argument |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-53483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Richard Vatz]]''' is a rhetorician responsible for the salience-agenda/meaning-spin conceptualization of rhetoric, later revised (2014) to an "agenda-spin" model, a conceptualization which emphasizes persuader responsibility for the agenda and spin he/she creates.  His theory is notable for its agent-focused perspective, articulated in ''The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion'' (Kendall Hunt), derived from the Summer, 1973 ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'' article, "The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation".
* '''[[Richard M. Weaver]]''' was a rhetorical and cultural critic well known for his contributions to the new conservatism. He focused on the ethical implications of rhetoric and his ideas can be seen in "Language is Sermonic" and "The Ethics of Rhetoric". According to Weaver there are four types of argument, and through the argument a person habitually uses the critic can see the rhetorician's worldview. Those who prefer the argument from genus or definition are idealists. Those who argue from similitude see the connectedness between things and are used by poets and religious individuals. The argument from consequence sees a cause and effect relationship. Finally the argument from circumstance considers the particulars of a situation and is an argument preferred by liberals.
* [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldua]] was a "Mestiza" and "Borderland" rhetorician, as well as a Mexican-American poet and pioneer in the field of Chicana lesbian feminism. Mestiza and Borderland rhetoric focused on ones' formation of identity, disregarding societal and discourse labels.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunsford|first=Andrea A.|date=1998|title=Toward a Mestiza rhetoric: Gloria Anzaldua on composition and postcoloniality|jstor=20866168|journal=JAC|volume=18|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With "Mestiza" rhetoric, one viewed the world as discovering one's "self" in others and others' "self" in you. Through this process, one accepted living in a world of contradictions and ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"/&gt; Anzaldua learned to balance cultures, being Mexican in the eyes of the Anglo-majority and Indian in a Mexican culture.&lt;ref name="Lunsford 1998 1–27"/&gt; Her other notable works include: Sinister Wisdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rhetorical tradition: Readings from classical times to the present|last=Bizzell|first=Patricia|last2=Herzberg|first2=Bruce|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2000|isbn=978-0-312-14839-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=1585–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borderlands/La Fronters: The New Mestiza,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rhetorical tradition: Readings from classical times to the present|last=Bizzell|first=Patricia|last2=Herzberg|first2=Bruce|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2000|isbn=978-0-312-14839-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=1584–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and La Prieta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical rhetoric: Excavating Gloria Anzaldua's "La Prieta"|last=Camp|first=Jessica Rae|publisher=Dissertation|year=2010|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/857938624|location=Ann Harbor, MI|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gertrude Buck]]''' was one of the prominent female rhetorical theorists who was also a composition educator. Her scholastic contributions such as "The present status of Rhetorical Theory"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getrude|first=Buck|date=1900|title=The Present Status of Rhetorical Theory|jstor=2917917|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=15|pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inspire the egalitarian status of hearers-speakers to achieve the goal of communication. Another piece that she edited with Newton Scott is "Brief English Grammar" which troubled the common prescriptive grammar. This book received a lot of praise and critiques for descriptive nature of social responsibility from non-mainstream beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward a feminist rhetoric: The writing of Gertrude Buck|last=Campbell|first=Joann|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1996|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Krista Ratcliffe''' is one of the prominent female rhetorical theorists. She wrote one of her influential models of ''"Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness."'' In it, she theorizes many ways in which effect has to navigate the pitfalls of biases, ideological and cultural conditioning, and appropriation. She points out and  recommends relentless engagement. In her Book,  Ratcliffe seems to recommend&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/facultystaff/profiles/new/newfaculty-15/Ratcliffe._Krista.html|title=Krista Ratcliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she said that I would suggest that teachers should keep themselves open to hearing diverse layers in their students' texts that both challenge their biases and point to new textual possibilities.

===Methods of analysis===

====Criticism seen as a method====
Rhetoric can be analyzed by a variety of methods and theories.  One such method is criticism.  When those using criticism analyze instances of rhetoric what they do is called rhetorical criticism (see section below). According to rhetorical critic [[Jim A. Kuypers]], "The use of rhetoric is an art; as such, it does not lend itself well to scientific methods of analysis.  Criticism is an art as well; as such, it is particularly well suited for examining rhetorical creations."&lt;ref name="Jim A 2009"&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Rhetorical Criticism as Art," in Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action, Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that criticism is a method of generating knowledge just as the scientific method is a method for generating knowledge: "The way the Sciences and the Humanities study the phenomena that surround us differ greatly in the amount of researcher personality allowed to influence the results of the study.  For example, in the Sciences researchers purposefully adhere to a strict method (the scientific method).  All scientific researchers are to use this same basic method, and successful experiments must be 100 percent replicable by others.  The application of the scientific method may take numerous forms, but the overall method remains the same—and the personality of the researcher is excised from the actual study. In sharp contrast, criticism (one of many Humanistic methods of generating knowledge) actively involves the personality of the researcher.  The very choices of what to study, and how and why to study a rhetorical artifact are heavily influenced by the personal qualities of the researcher. In criticism this is especially important since the personality of the critic considered an integral component of the study.  Further personalizing criticism, we find that rhetorical critics use a variety of means when examining a particular rhetorical artifact, with some critics even developing their own unique perspective to better examine a rhetorical artifact."&lt;ref name="Jim A 2009"/&gt;

[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)]] wrote on this point that, "Methods, then, admit of varying degrees of personality.  And criticism, on the whole, is near the indeterminate, contingent, personal end of the methodological scale.  In consequence of this placement, it is neither possible nor desirable for criticism to be fixed into a system, for critical techniques to be objectified, for critics to be interchangeable for purposes of [scientific] replication, or for rhetorical criticism to serve as the handmaiden of quasi-scientific theory.  [The] idea is that critical method is too personally expressive to be systematized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black]], Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method (Madison, Wi: University of Wisconsin Press, 1978), x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim A. Kuypers sums this idea of criticism as art in the following manner: "In short, criticism is an art, not a science.  It is not a scientific method; it uses subjective methods of argument; it exists on its own, not in conjunction with other methods of generating knowledge (i.e., social scientific or scientific).  [I]nsight and imagination top statistical applications when studying rhetorical action."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Rhetorical Criticism as Art," in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).  See also, Jim A. Kuypers, "Artistry, Purpose, and Academic Constraints in Rhetorical Criticism," in ''Purpose, Practice, and Pedagogy in Rhetorical Criticism'', Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observation on analytic method====
There does not exist an analytic method that is widely recognized as "the" rhetorical method, partly because many in rhetorical study see rhetoric as merely produced by reality (see dissent from that view below).   It is important to note that the object of rhetorical analysis is typically discourse, and therefore the principles of "rhetorical analysis" would be difficult to distinguish from those of "[[discourse analysis]]".  However, rhetorical analytic methods can also be applied to almost anything, including objects—a car, a castle, a computer, a comportment.

Generally speaking, rhetorical analysis makes use of rhetorical concepts (ethos, logos, kairos, mediation, etc.) to describe the social or epistemological functions of the object of study.  When the object of study happens to be some type of discourse (a speech, a poem, a joke, a newspaper article), the aim of rhetorical analysis is not simply to describe the claims and arguments advanced within the discourse, but (more important) to identify the specific semiotic strategies employed by the speaker to accomplish specific persuasive goals.  Therefore, after a rhetorical analyst discovers a use of language that is particularly important in achieving persuasion, she typically moves onto the question of "How does it work?"  That is, what effects does this particular use of rhetoric have on an audience, and how does that effect provide more clues as to the speaker's (or writer's) objectives?

There are some scholars who do partial rhetorical analysis and defer judgments about rhetorical success.  In other words, some analysts attempt to avoid the question of "Was this use of rhetoric successful [in accomplishing the aims of the speaker]?"  To others, however, that is the preeminent point: is the rhetoric strategically effective and what did the rhetoric accomplish?  This question allows a shift in focus from the speaker's objectives to the effects and functions of the rhetoric itself.

===Strategies=== &lt;!-- Anchor from redirect; caution. --&gt;
''Rhetorical strategies'' are the efforts made by authors to persuade or inform their readers.  Rhetorical strategies are employed by writers and refer to the different ways they can persuade the reader.  According to Gray, there are various argument strategies used in writing.  He describes four of these as argument from analogy, argument from absurdity, thought experiments, and inference to the best explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gray| first=J. W.| title=Four Argument Strategies| url=http://ethicalrealism.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/four-argument-strategies/| accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Modern [[rhetorical criticism]] explores the relationship between text and context; that is, how an instance of rhetoric relates to circumstances. Since the aim of rhetoric is to be persuasive, the level to which the rhetoric in question persuades its audience is what must be analyzed, and later criticized. In determining the extent to which a text is persuasive, one may explore the text's relationship with its audience, purpose, ethics, argument, evidence, arrangement, delivery, and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaking/Writing Connection|last=Ryan|first=David|publisher=Parthenon West Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9765684-9-0|location=Berkeley, CA|page=236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method'', scholar [[Edwin Black]] states, "It is the task of criticism not to measure&amp;nbsp;... discourses dogmatically against some parochial standard of rationality but, allowing for the immeasurable wide range of human experience, to see them as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;Black, Edwin. ''Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method''. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1978), 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the language "as they really are" is debatable, rhetorical critics explain texts and speeches by investigating their [[rhetorical situation]], typically placing them in a framework of speaker/audience exchange.  The antithetical view places the rhetor at the center of creating that which is considered the extant situation; i.e., the agenda and spin.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, Lloyd F. "The Rhetorical Situation." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'', Winter (1968). 1–14. {{JSTOR|40236733}}. cf. Vatz, Richard E. "The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation." ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'', Summer (1974) {{JSTOR|40236848}} and ''The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion'', (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional theoretical approaches====

Following the [[neo-Aristotelian]] approaches to criticism, scholars began to derive methods from other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, and the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Jansinski, James. "[http://blog.umd.edu/tpg/files/2012/08/Jasinski-WJC1.pdf The Status of Theory and Method in Rhetorical Criticism]." ''Western Journal of Communication'' 65, No. 3 (Summer 2001): 249. {{doi|10.1080/1057031010937470}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of critics' personal judgment decreased in explicit coverage while the analytical dimension of criticism began to gain momentum. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, methodological pluralism replaced the singular neo-Aristotelian method.  Methodological rhetorical criticism is typically done by deduction, where a broad method is used to examine a specific case of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja. 1989. ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice''. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  These types include:
* '''[[Ideological criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– critics engage rhetoric as it suggests the beliefs, values, assumptions, and interpretations held by the rhetor or the larger culture.  Ideological criticism also treats ideology as an artifact of discourse, one that is embedded in key terms (called "[[ideographs]]") as well as material resources and discursive embodiment.
* '''[[Cluster criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a method developed by [[Kenneth Burke]] that seeks to help the critic understand the rhetor's worldview.  This means identifying terms that are 'clustered' around key symbols in the rhetorical artifact and the patterns in which they appear.
* '''[[Frame analysis]]'''&amp;nbsp;– when used as rhetorical criticism, this theoretical perspective allows critics to look for how rhetors construct an interpretive lens in their discourse. In short, how they make certain facts more noticeable than others.  It is particularly useful for analyzing products of the news media.
* '''[[Genre criticism|Generic criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a method that assumes certain situations call for similar needs and expectations within the audience, therefore calling for certain types of rhetoric. It studies rhetoric in different times and locations, looking at similarities in the rhetorical situation and the rhetoric that responds to them.  Examples include eulogies, inaugural addresses, and declarations of war.
* '''[[Narrative criticism]]'''&amp;nbsp;– narratives help organize experiences in order to endow meaning to historical events and transformations.  Narrative criticism focuses on the story itself and how the construction of the narrative directs the interpretation of the situation.

By the mid-1980s, however, the study of rhetorical criticism began to move away from precise methodology towards conceptual issues. Conceptually driven criticism&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Houston Grey, "Conceptually-Oriented Criticism," in ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action'', [[Jim A. Kuypers]], ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  operates more through abduction, according to scholar [[James Jasinski]], who argues that this emerging type of criticism can be thought of as a back-and-forth between the text and the concepts, which are being explored at the same time.  The concepts remain "works in progress", and understanding those terms develops through the analysis of a text.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, "Status," 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is considered rhetorical when it focuses on the way some types of discourse react to situational exigencies—problems or demands—and constraints.  This means that modern rhetorical criticism is based in how the rhetorical case or object persuades, defines, or constructs the audience.  In modern terms, what can be considered rhetoric includes, but it is not limited to, speeches, scientific discourse, pamphlets, literary work, works of art, and pictures. Contemporary rhetorical criticism has maintained aspects of early neo-Aristotelian thinking through close reading, which attempts to explore the organization and stylistic structure of a rhetorical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leff Michael | year = 2001 | title = Lincoln at Cooper Union: Neo-Classical Criticism Revisited | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 232–48 | doi=10.1080/10570310109374704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using close textual analysis means rhetorical critics use the tools of classical rhetoric and literary analysis to evaluate the style and strategy used to communicate the argument.

====Purpose of criticism====

Rhetorical criticism serves several purposes or functions.  First, rhetorical criticism hopes to help form or improve public taste.  It helps educate audiences and develops them into better judges of rhetorical situations by reinforcing ideas of value, morality, and suitability.  Rhetorical criticism can thus contribute to the audience's understanding of themselves and society.

According to [[Jim A. Kuypers]], a dual purpose for performing criticism should be primarily to enhance our appreciation and understanding. "[W]e wish to enhance both our own and others' understanding of the rhetorical act; we wish to share our insights with others, and to enhance their appreciation of the rhetorical act.  These are not hollow goals, but quality of life issues.  By improving understanding and appreciation, the critic can offer new and potentially exciting ways for others to see the world. Through understanding we also produce knowledge about human communication; in theory this should help us to better govern our interactions with others." Criticism is a humanizing activity in that it explores and highlights qualities that make us human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim A. Kuypers]], "Artistry, Purpose, and Academic Constraints in Rhetorical Criticism," in Purpose, Practice, and Pedagogy in Rhetorical Criticism, Jim A. Kuypers, ed. (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==French==
Rhetoric was part of the curriculum in [[Jesuit]] and, to a lesser extent, Oratorian colleges until the [[French Revolution]]. For Jesuits, right from the foundation of the Society in France, rhetoric was an integral part of the training of young men toward taking up leadership positions in the Church and in State institutions, as [[Marc Fumaroli]] has shown it in his foundational ''Âge de l'éloquence'' (1980). The Oratorians, by contrast, reserved it a lesser place, in part due to the stress they placed on modern language acquisition and a more sensualist philosophy (like [[Bernard Lamy]]'s ''La Rhétorique ou l'Art de parler'' (1675), which is an excellent example of their approach). Nonetheless, in the 18th Century, rhetoric was the structure and crown of secondary education, with works such as Rollin's ''Treatise of Studies'' achieving a wide and enduring fame across the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas M. Conley, ''Rhetoric in the European Tradition'', University of Chicago Press, 1990 for insights on French pre-1789 rhetoricians; for a fuller historical review with excerpts, Philippe-Joseph Salazar, ''L'art de parler'', Paris, Klincksieck, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with [[Nicolas Boileau]] and [[François de Malherbe]], rhetoric is the instrument of the clarity of the comment and speech ; the literature that ensues from it is named "Sublime". The main representative remains [[Antoine de Rivarol|Rivarol]].

The French Revolution, however, turned this around. Philosophers such as [[Condorcet]], who drafted the French revolutionary chart for a people's education under the rule of reason, dismissed rhetoric as an instrument of oppression in the hands of clerics in particular. The Revolution went as far as to suppress the Bar, arguing that forensic rhetoric did disservice to a rational system of justice, by allowing [[Fallacy|fallacies]] and emotions to come into play. Nonetheless, as later historians of the 19th century were keen to explain, the Revolution was a high moment of eloquence and rhetorical prowess, although set against a background of rejecting rhetoric.

Under the First Empire and its wide-ranging educational reforms, imposed on or imitated across the Continent, rhetoric regained little ground. In fact, instructions to the newly founded Polytechnic School, tasked with training the scientific and technical elites, made it clear that written reporting was to supersede oral reporting. Rhetoric reentered secondary curriculum in fits and starts, but never regained the prominence it had enjoyed under the ''ancien régime'', although the penultimate year of secondary education was known as the Class of Rhetoric. When manuals were redrafted in the mid-century, in particular after the 1848 Revolution to formulate a national curriculum, care was taken to distance their approach to rhetoric from that of the Church, which was seen as an agent of conservatism and reactionary politics.

By the end of the 1870s, a major change had taken place: philosophy of the rationalist or eclectic kind, generally Kantian, had taken over rhetoric as the true end stage of secondary education (the so-called Class of Philosophy bridged secondary and university education). Rhetoric was then relegated to the study of literary figures of speech, a discipline later on taught as Stylistics within the French literature curriculum. More decisively, in 1890, a new standard written exercise superseded the rhetorical exercises of speech writing, letter writing and narration. The new genre, called dissertation, had been invented in 1866, for the purpose of rational argument in the philosophy class. Typically, in a dissertation, a question is asked, such as: "Is history a sign of humanity's freedom?" The structure of a dissertation consists in an introduction that elucidates the basic definitions involved in the question as set, followed by an argument or thesis, a counter-argument or antithesis, and a resolving argument or synthesis that is not a compromise between the former but the production of a new argument, ending with a conclusion that does not sum up the points but opens onto a new problem. Hegelianism influenced the dissertation design. It remains today the standard of writing in French humanities.

By the beginning of the 20th century, rhetoric was fast losing the remains of its former importance, and eventually was taken out of the school curriculum altogether at the time of the Separation of State and Churches (1905). Part of the argument was that rhetoric remained the last element of irrationality, driven by religious arguments, in what was perceived as inimical to Republican education. The move, initiated in 1789, found its resolution in 1902 when rhetoric was expunged from all curricula. At the same time, Aristotelian rhetoric, owing to a revival of Thomistic philosophy initiated by Rome, regained ground in what was left of Catholic education in France, in particular at the prestigious Faculty of Theology of Paris, now a private entity. Yet, rhetoric vanished substantially from the French scene, educational or intellectual, for some 60 years..

In the early 1960s a change began to take place, as the word rhetoric and the body of knowledge it covers began to be used again, in a modest and almost secret manner. The new linguistic turn, through the rise of [[semiotics]] as well as of structural [[linguistics]], brought to the fore a new interest in figures of speech as signs, the metaphor in particular (in the works of [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Groupe µ]], Michel Charles, Gérard Genette) while famed Structuralist [[Roland Barthes]], a classicist by training, perceived how some basic elements of rhetoric could be of use in the study of narratives, fashion and ideology. Knowledge of rhetoric was so dim in the early 1970s that his short memoir on rhetoric was seen as highly innovative. Basic as it was, it did help rhetoric regain some currency in avant-garde circles. [[Psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], his contemporary, makes references to rhetoric, in particular to the Pre-Socratics. Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] wrote on Voice.

At the same time, more profound work was taking place that eventually gave rise to the French school of rhetoric as it exists today.&lt;ref&gt;See also article on [[:fr:Rhétorique|Rhétorique]] in the French Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

This rhetorical revival took place on two fronts.&lt;ref&gt;See Philippe-Joseph Salazar's overview, "Rhetoric Achieves Nature. A View from Old Europe",'' Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'' 40(1), 2007, 71–88&lt;/ref&gt; First, in 17th-century French studies, the mainstay of French literary education, awareness grew that rhetoric was necessary to push the limits of knowledge further, and also to provide an antidote to [[Structuralism]] and its denial of historicism in culture. This was the pioneering work of Marc Fumaroli who, building on the work of classicist and Neo-Latinist Alain Michel and French scholars such as Roger Zuber, published his famed ''Age de l'Eloquence'' (1980), was one of the founders of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric and was eventually elevated to a chair in rhetoric at the prestigious College de France. He is the editor in chief of a monumental ''History of Rhetoric in Modern Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de la rhétorique dans l'Europe moderne 1450–1950'', [[Marc Fumaroli]] ed., Paris, [[Presses Universitaires de France]], 1999. {{ISBN|2-13-049526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His disciples form the second generation,&lt;ref&gt;Refer to " De l'éloquence à la rhétoricité, trente années fastes ", ''Dix-Septième Siècle'' 236, LIX (3), 2007, 421–26 {{ISBN|978-2-13-056096-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rhetoricians such as Françoise Waquet and Delphine Denis, both of the Sorbonne, or [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]] ([[:fr:Philippe-Joseph Salazar]] on the French Wikipedia), until recently at Derrida's College international de philosophie, laureate of the [[Harry Oppenheimer]] prize and whose recent book on  ''Hyperpolitique'' has attracted the French media's attention on a "re-appropriation of the means of production of persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idee-jour.fr/Apprendre-la-rhetorique-un-art.html idee-jour.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511232741/http://www.idee-jour.fr/Apprendre-la-rhetorique-un-art.html |date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, in the area of Classical studies, in the wake of Alain Michel, Latin scholars fostered a renewal in Cicero studies. They broke away from a pure literary reading of his orations, in an attempt to embed Cicero in European ethics. Meanwhile, among Greek scholars, the literary historian and philologist [[Jacques Bompaire]], the philologist and philosopher E. Dupréel, and later the literature historian [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] pioneered new studies in the Sophists and the Second Sophistic. The second generation of Classicists, often trained in philosophy as well (following [[Heidegger]] and Derrida, mainly), built on their work, with authors such as [[Marcel Detienne]] (now at Johns Hopkins), Nicole Loraux, Medievalist and logician [[:fr:Alain de Libera|Alain De Libera]] (Geneva),&lt;ref&gt;''L'art des Généralités'', Paris, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Ciceronian scholar Carlos Lévy (Sorbonne, Paris) and [[Barbara Cassin]] (Collége international de philosophie, Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Cassin,''L'effet sophistique'', Paris, Gallimard, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist of science [[Bruno Latour]] and economist Romain Laufer may also be considered part of, or close to this group. Also French philosophers specialized in Arabic commentaries on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;Maroun Aouad, ''Le Livre De la Rhétorique d'Ibn Tumlus''. Paris: Vrin. 2006. ''Le Commentaire Moyen d'[[Averroes]] à la Rhétorique d'Aristote''. Paris: Vrin. 3 Vol. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Links between the two strands—literary and philosophical—of the French school of rhetoric are strong and collaborative, and bear witness to the revival of rhetoric in France.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside the French school, the work of Belgians [[Chaim Perelman]] and his disciple Michel Meyer is noteworthy, although Perelman's foundational work remained generally unknown in France until the 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent issue of ''Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric'' presents current writing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_rhetoric/toc/par.42.4.html|title=Project MUSE&amp;nbsp;– Philosophy and Rhetoric-Volume 42, Number 4, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rhetoric==

Rhetoric is practiced by [[social]] animals in a variety of ways. For example, birds use [[Bird vocalization|song]], various animals warn members of their species of danger, [[chimpanzee]]s have the capacity to deceive through communicative keyboard systems, and deer stags compete for the attention of mates. While these might be understood as [[Animal communication|rhetorical actions]] (attempts at persuading through meaningful actions and [[utterance]]s), they can also be seen as rhetorical fundamentals shared by humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-19-510932-5|location=New York|pages=11–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of animal rhetoric has been described as biorhetorics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2001. [https://www.academia.edu/6409666/On_biorhetorics A note on biorhetorics]. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 29(2): 693–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[self-awareness]] required to practice rhetoric might be difficult to notice and acknowledge in some animals. However, some animals are capable of acknowledging themselves in a mirror, and therefore, they might be understood to be self-aware and engaged in rhetoric when practicing some form of language, and therefore, rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Diane|date=2011|title=Creaturely Rhetorics|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=44|issue=1|pages=88–94|doi=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0088|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropocentrism plays a significant role in human-animal relationships, reflecting and perpetuating binaries in which humans are assumed to be beings that "have" extraordinary qualities while animals are regarded as beings that "lack" those qualities. This [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] is manifested through other forms as well, such as reason and sense, mind and body, ideal and phenomenon in which the first category of each pair ([[reason]], [[mind]], and [[Platonic ideal|ideal]]) represents and belongs to only humans. By becoming aware of and overcoming these [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] conceptions including the one between humans and animals, human knowledge of themselves and the world is expected to become more complete and holistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segeerdahl|first=Pär|date=2015|title=The rhetoric and prose of the human/animal contrast|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=42|pages=36–49|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between humans and animals (as well as the rest of the natural world) is often defined by the human rhetorical act of naming and categorizing animals through [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific]] and [[Folk taxonomy|folk]] labeling. The act of naming partially defines the rhetorical relationships between humans and animals, though both may be understood to engage in rhetoric beyond human naming and categorizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melzow|first=Candice Chovanec|date=Spring 2012|title=Identification, Naming, and Rhetoric in The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness and The Maine Woods|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|volume=19.2|issue=2|pages=356–74|doi=10.1093/isle/iss084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the binary assumptions deriving from [[anthropocentrism]], which regarded animals as creatures without extraordinarily qualities, it does exist some specific animals with a sort of [[Phronesis|phrónēsis]] which confers them capabilities to "learn and receive instruction" with rudimentary understanding of some significant signs. Those animals do practice deliberative, judicial, and [[epideictic]] rhetoric deploying [[ethos]], [[logos]], and [[pathos]] with gesture and preen, sing and growl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=George|date=1992|title=A Hoot in the Dark The evolution of general rhetoric|jstor=40238276|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|volume=25|number=1|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since animals offer models of rhetorical behavior and interaction that are physical, even instinctual, but perhaps no less artful, getting rid of our accustomed focus on verbal language and consciousness concepts will help people interested in rhetoric and communication matters promote human-animals' rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawhee|first=D.|date=2011|title=Toward a Bestial Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=44|number=1|pages=81–87|doi=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0081|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.44.1.0081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rhizobiales''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[Gram-negative]] [[Alphaproteobacteria]].

The [[rhizobia]], which [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] and are [[symbiotic]] with plant roots, appear in several different families. The four families [[Bradyrhizobiaceae]], [[Hyphomicrobiaceae]], [[Phyllobacteriaceae]], and [[Rhizobiaceae]] contain at least six genera of nitrogen-fixing, legume-nodulating, microsymbiotic bacteria. Examples are the genera ''[[Bradyrhizobium]]'' and ''[[Rhizobium]]''. Species of the Methylocystaceae are [[methanotroph]]s; they use [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) or [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as their sole energy and carbon sources. Other important genera are the human pathogens ''[[Bartonella]]'' and ''[[Brucella]]'', as well as ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' ([[genetic engineering]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">A '''slip joint''' is a mechanical construction allowing extension and compression in a linear structure.

==General forms==

Slip joints can be designed to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another.  Examples of the latter are [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]]s, [[hiking pole]]s, or similar [[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] device.  The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a [[cam]], a [[set screw]] or similar locking mechanism.  Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's [[levelling rod]]s.  These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.

Examples of continuous slip joints are given below.

==Special purpose slip joints==

===Civil Engineering===

Slip joints in large structures are used to allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way. For example, if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian [[skyway]] at some high level, there are two options in structural engineering. If the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by [[earthquake]]s. In this case it may be appropriate to construct a rigid connection between the buildings, although this may require additional supporting members within the structures. On the other hand, a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not coupled rigidly but instead which is allowed to slide or "float" relative to one or both structures. This is especially suitable where the two structures may respond differently to ground motion. The structure will not be completely free to move but rather may use elastic materials to locate it near the center of its range of motion and [[viscosity|viscous]] [[shock absorber]]s to absorb energy and to restrict the speed of relative motion. When a sliding connection is used it is extremely important that there be sufficient range of motion without failure to accommodate the maximum credible relative motion of the structures. Additional "fail safe" flexible connections may be added to ensure that the structure does not fall, although it may be damaged to a point of being unservicable or unrepairable

Slip joints are common under conditions where temperature changes can cause expansion and contraction that may overstress a structure.  These are generally referred to as ''[[expansion joint]]s.''  Bridges and overpasses frequently have sliding joints that allow a deck to move relative to piers or abutments.  The joints can be constructed with elastomeric pads that permit motion or can use rollers on flat surfaces to allow the ends to move smoothly.  The exact details are limited by the imagination of the designer.

===Mechanical Engineering===

Slip joints are sometimes found in tubular structures such as piping, but are generally avoided for this application due to requirements for sealing against leakage, instead using either a large loop that is allowed to flex or a semi-rigid [[bellows]]. Slip joints are used when the main problem is a large axial movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/products/slip_type_compensators.htm Slip Type Expansion Joints] U.S. Bellows, (retrieved January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Pipe supports often are slip joints to allow for the thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe relative to the support.

Slip Joint connections are also commonly used in [[Piping_and_plumbing_fitting#Slip_Joint_Fitting|waste water plumbing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Source reduction''' is activities designed to reduce the volume, mass, or toxicity of products throughout the life cycle.  It includes the design and manufacture, use, and disposal of products with minimum toxic content, minimum volume of material, and/or a longer useful life. 

An example of source reduction is use of a [[Reusable shopping bag]] at the grocery store;  although it uses more material than a single-use [[disposable]] bag, the material per use is less. 

== Synonyms ==
[[Pollution Prevention]] (or P2) and [[Toxics use reduction]] are also called source reduction because they address the use of hazardous substances at the source.

== Procedures ==
Source Reduction is achieved through improvements in design, production, use, reuse, recycling, and through Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP).  A [[Life-cycle assessment]] is useful to help choose among several alternatives and options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|authorlink= |author2=Kassidi  |date=August 2003 |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= 10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Source reduction in the United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] offers guidance for labelling claims: "Source reduction" refers to reducing or lowering the weight, volume or toxicity of a product or package. To avoid being misleading, source reduction claims must qualify the amount of the source reduction and give the basis for any comparison that is made. These principles apply regardless of whether a term like "source reduced" is used.

The [[Massachusetts]] Toxics Use Reduction Program (TURA) offers 6 strategies to achieve source reduction:{{fact|date=June 2015}}
# Toxic chemical substitution
# Production process modification
# Finished product reformulation
# Production [[modernization]]
# Improvements in operations and maintenance
# In-process recycling of production material

'''Special education''' (also known as '''special needs education''', '''aided education''', '''exceptional education''' or '''Special Ed''') is the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their [[individual differences]] and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.

Common special needs include [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] (such as [[dyslexia]]), [[communication disorder]]s, [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] (such as [[ADHD]]), [[physical disabilities]] (such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[spina bifida]], and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]), and [[developmental disabilities]] (such as [[autism spectrum disorders]] and [[intellectual disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx What is special education?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512043236/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx |date=12 May 2009 }} from New Zealand's Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a [[resource room]].

[[Intellectual giftedness]] is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialised teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term "special education" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students with disabilities. [[Gifted education]] is handled separately.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, [[remedial education]] can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high [[intelligence]] can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] during [[civil disorder]] or a [[war]].

In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Therefore, special education in developed countries is often regarded as a service rather than a place.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (1994).

The opposite of special education is ''general education''. General education is the standard [[curriculum]] presented without special teaching methods or supports. Students receiving special education services can enroll in a General education setting to learn along with students without disabilities.

==Identifying students or learners with special needs==
[[File:Skolegutt.jpg|alt=A boy wearing a jacket and a backpack|thumb|A six-year-old boy with [[Down syndrome]] is ready for his first day of school.]]
Some children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. They may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with [[intellectual disability]], may have various forms of [[brain damage]], may have a [[developmental disorder]], may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.

For students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have learning difficulties, two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the ''discrepancy model'' and the ''response to intervention model''. The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students' achievements are noticeably below what is expected. At which the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The [[response to intervention]] model advocates earlier intervention.

In the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student's academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her [[IQ]]. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.

The alternative approach, [[response to intervention]], identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a [[Reading for special needs|reading remediation]] program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.

==Individual needs==
A special education program should be customised to address each individual student's unique needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Special education programs need to be individualised so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Libby |title=Time and learning in the special education classroom |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y. |year=1990 |page= 122 |isbn=0-7914-0371-8 |oclc=20635959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student's [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Another name for a student's Individualized Education Plan is a student's [[Individual Learning Plan]] (ILP).

"The IEP is meant to address each child’s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs|title=Understanding Individualized Education Programs|website=Understood.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children who are not yet 3, an [[Individual Family Service Plan]] (IFSP) contains information on the child's present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.

In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a federal law that requires that every school system in the nation must provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptional Learners|last=Hallahan |first=Daniel |publisher=Pearson Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-703370-6|location=Boston|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Special Education Process.jpg|thumb|Procedure that a person must follow in order to receive special education accommodations]]
Students with special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt; The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the better it is for them to get the accommodations that they need in order for them to get the most out of their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student's needs. Accommodations and Modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aides or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_one/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107145830/http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_One/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a [[resource room]].

Parent of students with a learning disability must know what type of disability their child has, so they can get accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Special Education Process Explained|url=http://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/what-is-special-education/the-special-education-process-explained/|website=Special Education Guide|accessdate=22 March 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of provision==
[[Image:PS 721 Spec Ed jeh.JPG|thumb|PS 721, a [[special school]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] exclusively for the education of students with special needs]]

Schools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):

* ''[[Inclusion (education)|Inclusion]]:'' In this approach, students with special needs spend all, or most of the school day with students who do not have special needs. Because inclusion can require substantial modification of the general curriculum, most schools use it only for selected students with mild to moderate special needs, which is accepted as a [[best practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith P |title=Have we made any progress?

Students may occasionally leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services that might require specialised equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class, such as [[speech and language therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[rehabilitation counseling]]. They might also leave the regular classroom for services that require privacy, such as counseling sessions with a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowe, Frank |title=Making Inclusion Work |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-13-017603-6 |oclc=54374653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Segregation'' in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, students with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students. Segregated students may attend the same school where regular classes are provided, but spend all instructional time exclusively in a separate classroom for students with special needs. If their special class is located in an ordinary school, they may be provided opportunities for social integration outside the classroom, such as by eating meals with non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html Warnock Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111230317/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html |date=11 January 2013 }} (1978).

These students may receive one-on-one instruction or group instruction. Students who have been [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] or [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] are not considered excluded in this sense.
* ‘’[[Co-Teaching]]:’’ In this setting, students with disabilities are placed in a General education classroom to learn along with their disabled peers and non-disabled peers. A General Education teacher and a Special Education teacher work as partners in instruction.

===Effective Instruction for students with disabilities===

* ''Goal Directed'': Each child must have an individualised Education Program (IEP) that distinguishes his/her particular needs. The child must get the services that are designed for him/her. These services will allow him/her to reach his/her annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.
* ''Research-Based Methods''- There has been a lot of research done about students with disabilities and the best way to teach them. Testing, IQs, interviews, the discrepancy model, etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child. Once that is determined, the next step is the best way for the child to learn. There are plenty of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction
* ''Guided by student performance''- While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year, constant informal assessments must take place. These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher. The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or to easy.&lt;ref name="Bos, C. S. 2005"&gt;Bos, C. S. &amp; Vaughn, S. (2005). Strategies for teaching students with learning and behavior problems. (6th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special schools===
A ''special school'' is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], physical [[disabilities]] or behavioural problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.

Special schools provide individualised education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, [[Sensory perception|sensory]] rooms, or [[swimming pool]]s, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.

In recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in [[Inclusion (education)|mainstream schools]]. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialised education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of Least Restrictive Environment as mandated in the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Ron (2002). "Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's Schools (3rd ed.)Merrill Prentice Hall. New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative is a '''special unit''' or '''special classroom''', also called a '''self-contained classroom''', which is a separate room or rooms dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. These classrooms are typically staffed by specially trained teachers, who provide specific, individualised instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Self-contained classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the self-contained classroom full-time, or students who are [[mainstreaming (education)|included]] in certain general education classes. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a [[resource room]].

====History of special schools====
One of the first special schools in the world was the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach [[Blindness|blind]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=/pages-infos/pages/informations_generales/presentation_de_l_inja/histoire-inja/histoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 History of the INJA]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233247/http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=%2Fpages-infos%2Fpages%2Finformations_generales%2Fpresentation_de_l_inja%2Fhistoire-inja%2Fhistoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first school in U.K, for the Deaf was established 1760 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/deafed/Session%202A.htm |title=Session 2A |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922095519/http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh by [[Thomas Braidwood]], with education for [[Blindness and education|visually impaired]] people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.

In the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in [[Bleak House]] and [[Little Dorrit]].&lt;ref&gt;''The history of special education: From isolation to integration''. MA Winzer&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Students with disabilities were housed with people with [[mental illness]]es, and they were not educated much, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;Inventing the feeble mind: A history of mental retardation in the United States. S McCuen – ''Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law'', 1997 – Duke Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Deinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H. R., Beegle, R. &amp; Stowe, M.J. (2007). Public policy and developmental disabilities: A 35-year retrospective and a 5-year prospective on the core concepts in disability. In: S. Odom, R.H. Horner, M.E. Snell, &amp; J. Blacher, ''Handbook on Developmental Disabilities'', 15-34. London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of "regular teachers".

With the Amendments to the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997]], school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] to many educators, students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C.M. (1998). ''Restructuring high school for all students: Taking inclusion to the next level''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brooks Publishing co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructional strategies==
{{Anchor|Modifications|Accommodations}}
&lt;!--  This section does not discuss *where* the student is taught.  Please discuss *how* the student is taught.  --&gt;

The student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://rse.sagepub.com/content/9/6/29.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

Different instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either ''accommodations'' or ''modifications''.

An ''accommodation'' is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons.&lt;ref name=Ofqual&gt;{{cite report

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.

;Examples of modifications:
* Skipping subjects: Students may be taught less information than typical students, skipping over material that the school deems inappropriate for the student's abilities or less important than other subjects. For example, students with poor fine motor skills may be taught to print [[block letters]], but not [[cursive]] handwriting.
* Simplified assignments: Students may read the same literature as their peers but have a simpler version, such as Shakespeare with both the original text and a modern paraphrase available.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, Sue.  "Macbeth in the Resource Room: Students with Learning Disabilities Study Shakespeare."  ''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', v28 n9 p575-81 Nov 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shorter assignments: Students may do shorter homework assignments or take shorter, more concentrated tests.
* Extra aids: If students have deficiencies in working memory, a list of vocabulary words, called a ''word bank'', can be provided during tests, to reduce lack of recall and increase chances of comprehension. Students might use a calculator when other students do not.
* Extended time: Students with a slower processing speed may benefit from extended time for assignments and/or tests in order to have more time to comprehend questions, recall information, and synthesize knowledge.
* Students can be offered a flexible setting in which to take tests. These settings can be a new location to provide for minimal distractions.

;Examples of accommodations:
* Response accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Typing homework assignments rather than hand-writing them (considered a modification if the subject is [[penmanship|learning to write by hand]]). Having someone else write down answers given verbally.
* Presentation accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Examples include listening to [[audiobook]]s rather than reading printed books. These may be used as substitutes for the text, or as supplements intended to improve the students' reading fluency and phonetic skills. Similar options include designating a person to read to the student, or providing [[text to speech]] software. This is considered a modification if the purpose of the assignment is [[Learning to read|reading skills acquisition]]. Other presentation accommodations may include designating a person to take notes during lectures or using a talking [[calculator]] rather than one with only a visual display.
* Setting accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Taking a test in a quieter room. Moving the class to a room that is physically accessible, e.g., on the first floor of a building or near an [[elevator]]. Arranging seating assignments to benefit the student, e.g., by sitting at the front of the classroom.
* Scheduling accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students may be given rest breaks or extended time on tests (may be considered a modification, if speed is a factor in the test). Use a timer to help with time management.

All developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

In addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student's personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with special needs and includes [[speech and language pathology]], [[audiology]], psychological services, [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], counseling services, including [[rehabilitation counseling]], orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology services, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other appropriate support services.&lt;ref name="Related Services"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.

As an example, students who have [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s, poor impulse control, or other behavioral challenges may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Simpson, Richard L. |author2=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A university field, termed ''severe disabilities'', also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Snell, M.E. |author2=Brown, F. |year=2011 |title=Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities |edition=7th |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with [[supported employment]] services, and typically with "transition to adulthood" &lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., DeStefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policies''. Sycamore, IL:Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, D. &amp; Ferguson, P. (1987/2011). The promise of adulthood. In: M. Snell &amp; F. Brown, ''Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities''. Madrid: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.

==Issues==
At-risk students (those with educational needs that are not associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students who have disabilities. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as students with disabilities may impede the educational progress of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwood CR |title=Longitudinal analysis of time, engagement, and achievement in at-risk versus non-risk students |journal=Except Child |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=May 1991  |pmid=2070811 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some special education classes have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/Watering_Up_the_Curriculum_for_Adolescents_with_Learning_Disabilities,_Part_I:_Goals_of_the_Knowledge_Dimension |title=Watering Up the Curriculum for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities, Part I: Goals of the Knowledge Dimension |accessdate=2010-04-21 |last=Ellis |first=Edwin |year=2002 |publisher=WETA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of inclusion (in mainstream classrooms) has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://publicculture.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/13/3/349 |title=The Critical Limits of Embodiment: Disability's Criticism |author=Carol A.

Parents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single "fully included" student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge/&gt;

Linked to this, there is debate about the extent to which students with special needs, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lews|first1=Ann|last2=Norwich|first2=Brahm|title=Special Teaching for Special Children?|date=2005|publisher=Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes, UK|isbn=0335214053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mintz|first1=Joseph|title=Professional Uncertainty, Knowledge and Relationship in the Classroom: A Psycho-social Perspective|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415822961|url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415822961/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students' placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s or [[ADHD]], while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001996968|title=Development And Validation Of A Process For Screening Referrals To Special Education |author=Amanda M.

Whether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a [[persistent vegetative state]], is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/education/20donovan.html?pagewanted=all

|newspaper = The New York Times
|author = Otterman, Sharon
|date = 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.

Another large issue is the lack of resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with [[Disability and Poverty|special needs in developing countries]] do not have access to education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue would be budget cuts. Cuts can affect special education students who don't have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to children with disabilities. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f8ad9957-dcd5-4bd6-9000-d2db068bc640@sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4201{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that we spend too much money on it, there is not enough money put into it or that the money that is given isn't being spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to suffer budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that don't actually benefit the child.&lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427399&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global issues ===
Children with disabilities are often denied their right to education. However, little is known about their school attendance patterns. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location= |pages=44, Box 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|year=2014|title=Teaching and Learning: Achieving quality for all|url=|journal=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world's children, were living with a ‘moderate or severe disability’ in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, people of working age with disabilities were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in [[Bangladesh]], 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in [[Zambia]]; 56% and 72% in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

It has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, [[Bhutan]] and [[Iraq]], children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In [[Thailand]], almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005/06, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Children with disabilities require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services.

;South Africa
White Papers in 1995 and 2001 discuss special education in the country. Local schools are given some independent authority.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Both modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student's individual needs.

;Japan
{{Main|Education in Japan}}

Japanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: [[special school]]s, special classrooms with another school, in [[resource rooms]] (which are called ''tsukyu''), or in regular classrooms.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special schools are reserved for students whose severe disabilities cannot be accommodated in the local school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. ''Tsukyu'' are [[resource room]]s that students with milder problems use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.

;Pakistan
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
After independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of special/disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. Recently, Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.

Special education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Both [[special school]]s and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most students with disabilities are placed in special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students with special education who wish accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam's integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

With respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for students who are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students must provide documentation Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

[[File:Kötitz Rathaus.JPG|thumb|A special school for children with special emotional needs in Kötitz, Germany]]

Most students with special needs in Germany attend a [[special school]] that serves only children with special needs. These include:
* ''Förderschule für Lernbehinderte'' (special school for learning disabilities): for children who have challenges that impair learning
* ''Förderschule mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Geistige Entwicklung'' (school for cognitive development): for children with very severe learning challenges
* ''Förderschule Schwerpunkt emotionale und soziale Entwicklung'' (school for emotional and social development): for children who have special emotional needs
* ''Förderschule für Blinde'' (school for the blind): for blind children
* ''Förderschule für Sehbehinderte'' (school for the visually impaired): for children who are visually challenged
* ''Förderschule für Gehörlose'' (school for the deaf): for deaf children
* ''Förderschule für Schwerhörige'' (school for the hearing impaired): for children who are hearing impaired
* ''Förderschule für Körperbehinderte'' (school for children with physical disabilities): for children with physical disabilities
* ''Förderschule für Sprachbehinderte'' (school for children with language disorders): for children with language disorders
* ''Förderschule für Taubblinde'' (school for the deafblind): for children who are deafblind
* ''Schule für Kranke'' (school for ill children): for children who are too ill to attend school or are hospitalized for a longer period of time.
* ''Förderschule für schwer mehrfach Behinderte'' (school for children with severe and multiple disabilities): for children with severe and multiple disabilities who need very special care and attention. Sometimes these children are only susceptible for very basic emotional and sensory stimulation. Thus teachers at these school (as well as at schools for the deafblind) are highly specialized professionals.

One in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.

Some special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school).

Students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Greece

Greek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations are responsive to students' needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.

As a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the "Going to School Together" policy (''Weer Samen Naar School'').&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards "suitable education" (''passend onderwijs''), based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''Norway'''

The National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]]. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the State, and 4 units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.

Students with disabilities have a "guaranteed right" to appropriate accommodations on assessments.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Schools are generally considered autonomous.

;Slovenia

On national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school's examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Spain

Schools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Spanish non-governmental organizations like [[ONCE]] have traditionally provided significant services to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Sweden

Local schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

There are special schools (Swedish:Särskola) for students with low abilities to attend normal education. There has in 2012-2013 been media criticism on the fact that students with light problems such as [[dyslexia]] have been placed in special schools, seriously hampering their chances on the labour market.

;Switzerland

Education is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; However, integration is typical.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

In [[England and Wales]] the [[acronym]] ''SEN'' for [[Special Educational Needs]] denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |title=Special education needs, Special needs education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306171514/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England ''SEN PPS'' refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. ''SENAS'' is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. ''SENCO'' refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child's educational provision. The [[Department for Education]] oversees special education in England.

Most students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5vhVPZoIG?url=http://education.staffordshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6C2C3FF2-43F1-40A4-AB6F-77E4CC4602F6/22865/SENCOResourceCentreCompletedocument2.pdf Management of Inclusion].  The SENCO Resource Centre, part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] the [[Additional Support Needs Act]] places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In [[Scotland]] the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the [[Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004|Additional Support for Learning Act]] means that both ''SEN'' and ''ASN'' (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.

At a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|The Ministry of Education]], who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|title=Special Needs Education in Turkey - Turkey - Angloinfo|work=Angloinfo|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417154851/https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to get special education you are required certain things:
* "Residency certificate&amp;nbsp;
* Written application by the parents to the school administration&amp;nbsp;
* Personal development report of the child (if already registered)&amp;nbsp;
* Child's health report from the hospital." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği]] (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a [[special school]].

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.

As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.

Before 1978, little action was taken to educate children with disabilities in Columbia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created.

The history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called "Plan Nacional para el Desarrollo de la Education Especial". The purposes of the plan was to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include students with disabilities, called Law 115. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuadros|first=Jose|date=May 2005|title=The Status of Disability in Colombia and the Importance of Parental Perceptions on the Development of Special Education|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ966524.pdf|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children Plus|volume=1|pages=8|via=google scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamenopoulou|first=Leda|date=2018|title=Inclusive Education in the global South?

The most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that "the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services".

All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs.

Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/16_03/Hist163.shtml |title=The History of Special Education|author=Priscilla Pardini |year= 2002 |journal=Rethinking Schools |volume=16 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.&lt;ref name=Blanchett /&gt; Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, "thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education."&lt;ref&gt;Tejeda-Delgado, M.

During the 1960s, in some part due to the [[civil rights movement]], some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ladson-Billings, Gloria |title=The dreamkeepers: successful teachers of African American children |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=1-55542-668-9 |oclc=30072651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision, which declared unconstitutional the "[[separate but equal]]" arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for [[PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and [[Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia]], which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of students with disabilities was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Blanchett&gt;Blanchett, W. J. (2009). A retrospective examination of urban education: From "brown" to the resegregation of African Americans in special education—it is time to "go for broke". Urban Education, 44(4), 370–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.

In US government-run schools, the dominant model is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]]. In the United States, three out of five students with academic learning challenges spend the overwhelming majority of their time in the regular classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009).

== Integrating technology in special ed. classrooms ==

=== Autism ===
Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences. 

[[Autism]] is known as a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently than others. Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands.&amp;nbsp;For students with autism, there are apps called "visual scene displays" that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech-language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student's verbal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/teaching-technology-autism_n_6865030.html|title=The Technology That's Giving Students With Autism a Greater Voice|date=2015-04-20|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It's now believed that there's no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

=== Down syndrome ===
If a student has [[down syndrome]], [[assistive technology]] can help with their learning experience. Author of&amp;nbsp;''Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,''&amp;nbsp;Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Down_Syndrome.html?id=wuh9OlwsWaQC|title=Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together|last=Hassold|first=Terry J.|last2=Patterson|first2=David|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471296867|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology is crucial in helping Down's students with their writing ability. Down syndrome children tend to have shorter, stubbier fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down's often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help down syndrome students during their educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downsyndromepossibilities.blogspot.com/p/assisstive-technology.html|title=Down Syndrome: Assisstive Technology|website=Down Syndrome|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Today many people with disabilities are breaking barriers through the use of technology. For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology is a necessary tool that enables them to engage in or perform many tasks. Integrating technology will allow students to increase their self-confidence, self-motivation, independence and they will also be able to engage in different activities within the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hfdss006/conf/2002/proceedings/16.htm|title=2002 Conference Proceedings|website=www.csun.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|[[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in an attempt to justify God's existence in light of the apparent imperfections of the world.]]
{{God|related}}
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar|challenges}}

'''Theodicy''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|i}}), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]], thus resolving the issue of the [[problem of evil]]. Some theodicies also address the [[evidential problem of evil]] by attempting "to make the existence of an [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omnibenevolence|all-good or omnibenevolent]] God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Pecorino, ''An Introduction to Philosophy: An Online Textbook'' (2000), Chapter 3: ‘Philosophy of Religion’, Section 11: Problem of Evil, online at http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%203%20Religion/Problem_of_Evil.htm. Retrieved September 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that [[existence of God|God's existence]] is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.&lt;ref&gt;A defence is “an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction between the existence of God... and the existence of evil.” Michael Rea and Louis B. Pojman, eds., ''Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology'' (Cengage Learning, 2015, 7th ed.), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work ''[[Théodicée]]'', though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher [[John Hick]] traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, ''Evil and the God of Love'', identifying three major traditions:
# the Plotinian theodicy, named after [[Plotinus]]
# the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which Hick based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]
# the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which Hick developed, based on the thinking of St. [[Irenaeus]]

The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg, Ola Agevall, ''The Max Weber Dictionary: Key Words and Central Concepts'' (Stanford University Press, 2005), 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (Doubleday, 1st ed, 1967), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Holocaust]], a number of [[Jewish theology|Jewish theologians]] developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|version of the free-will defence]] argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.{{Citation needed lead|date=October 2016}}

Similar to a theodicy, a [[#Cosmodicy and anthropodicy|cosmodicy]] attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.

==Definition and etymology==
As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the "answer to the question of why God permits evil".&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom, and Evil'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] that mitigates against the existence of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theodicy and {{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word ''theodicy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words Θεός ''Τheos'' and δίκη ''dikē''. ''Theos'' is translated "God" and ''dikē'' can be translated as either "trial" or "judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=di/kh "δίκη"]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theodicy literally means "justifying God".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', s. v. [http://0-www.britannica.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/EBchecked/topic/590596/theodicy "theodicy"], accessed October 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Nick Trakakis]] proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:
* Common sense views of the world
* Widely held historical and scientific opinion
* Plausible moral principles&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H4 |title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |author=Trakakis, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin &amp; Tsui-James 2002, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; A theodicy is often based on a prior [[natural theology]], which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Defenses propose solutions to the [[logical problem of evil]], while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

{{quote|"It is important to note that there are at least two concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad concept picks out any bad state of affairs... [and] has been divided into two categories: natural evil and moral evil. Natural evils are bad states of affairs which do not result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral evils. Evil in the broad sense, which includes all natural and moral evils, tends to be the sort of evil referenced in theological contexts... [T]he narrow concept of evil picks out only the most morally despicable... [it] involves moral condemnation, [and] is appropriately ascribed only to moral agents and their actions."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"&gt;Calder, Todd, "The Concept of Evil", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.

Philosopher [Susan Nieman] says "a [[Crimes against humanity|''crime against humanity'']] is something for which we have procedures, ... [and it] can be ... fit into the rest of our experience. To call an action ''evil'' is to suggest that it cannot [be fitted in]..."&lt;ref name="Susan Nieman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieman|first1=Susan|title=Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-16850-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LpKCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Evil%20in%20Modern%20Thought%20by%20Susan%20Nieman&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  

Marxism, "selectively elaborating Hegel," defines evil in terms of its effect.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=N. T.|title=Evil and the Justice of God|year=2006|publisher=Intervarsity Press|location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-3415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}  Philosopher John Kekes says the effect of evil must include actual harm "that 'interferes with the functioning of a person as a full-fledged agent.' (Kekes 1998, 217)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  Christian philosophers and theologians such as  [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[N. T. Wright]] also define evil in terms of effect saying an "...act is objectively good (or bad) if it is good (or bad) in its consequences".&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swinburne|first1=Richard|title=Providence and the Problem of Evil|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-823799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;  Hinduism defines evil in terms of its effect saying "the evils that afflict people (and indeed animals) in the present life are the effects of wrongs committed in a previous life".&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Some contemporary philosophers argue a focus on the effects of evil is inadequate as a definition since evil can observe without actively causing the harm, and it is still evil.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  

[[Pseudo-Dionysus]] defines evil by those aspects that show an absence of good.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|37}}  Writers in this tradition saw things as belonging to 'forms' and evil as an absence of being a good example of their form: as a deficit of goodness where goodness ought to have been present. In this same line of thinking, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] also defined evil as an absence of good, as did theologian and monk [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said: "... a man is called ''bad'' insofar as he lacks a virtue, and an eye is called ''bad'' insofar as it lacks the power of sight."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|37}} ''Bad'' as an absence of ''good'' resurfaces in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Karl Barth|Barth]].  Very similar are the [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Plotinus]] and contemporary philosopher Denis O'Brien, who say evil is a privation.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, D., 1996, “Plotinus on matter and evil,” in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, L.P. Gerson (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 171–195.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Plotinus"&gt;Plotinus, The Enneads, S. Mackenna (trans.), London: Faber, 4th edition, revised by B.S. Page, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Immanuel Kant]] was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil, giving an evaluative definition of evil based on its cause as having a will that is not fully good.  Kant has been an important influence on philosophers like [[Hanna Arendt]], [[Claudia Card]], and Richard Bernstein.&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|title=Kant: Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: And Other Writings|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-59049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...Hanna Arendt... uses the term [radical evil] to denote a new form of wrongdoing which cannot be captured by other moral concepts."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  The Muslim also provides an evaluative definition of evil saying it is the result of the world not being fully Muslim.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Claudia Card says evil is excessive wrong-doing; others like [[Hillel Steiner]] say evil is qualitatively not quantitatively distinct from mere wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt; 

[[John Locke|Locke]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Liebniz]] define good and evil in terms of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="John Locke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1836|publisher=B.Griffin and Co.|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=2018|publisher=Lerner Publishing Group|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=978 151 248609 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liebniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm|title=Theodicy|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo books|isbn=978-1-61640-295-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Richard Swinburne find that definition inadequate, saying, "the good of individual humans...consists...in their having free will...the ability to develop ...character..., to show courage and loyalty, to love, to be of use, to contemplate beauty and discover truth... All that [good]...cannot be achieved without ... suffering along the way."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

{{quote|"Most theorists writing about evil believe that evil action requires a certain sort of motivation... the desire to cause harm, or to do wrong,...pleasure (Steiner 2002), the desire to annihilate all being (Eagleton 2010), or the destruction of others for its own sake (Cole 2006). When evil is restricted to actions that follow from these sorts of motivations, theorists sometimes say that their subject is pure, radical, diabolical, or monstrous evil. This suggests that their discussion is restricted to a type, or form, of evil and not to evil per se."&lt;ref name= "Todd Calder"/&gt;}}

Some theorists define evil by what emotions are connected to it. "For example, Laurence Thomas believes that evildoers take delight in causing harm or feel hatred toward their victims (Thomas 1993, 76–77)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;   Buddhism defines evil as behavior resulting from a failure to emotionally detach from the world.&lt;ref name="Nyanaponika Thera"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thera|first1=Nyanaponika|title=The Roots of Good and Evil: Buddhist Texts translated from the Pali|date=2008|isbn=978-955-24-0316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians generally define evil in terms of both human responsibility and the nature of God: "If we take the essentialist view of Christian ethics... evil is anything contrary to God's good nature...(character or attributes)."&lt;ref name="Joseph B. Onyango Okello"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okello|first1=Joseph B. Onyango|title=Evil and Pain: A Critique of the Materialistic Account of Evil|date=2017|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, Oregon|isbn=978-1-5326-0134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Judaic view, while acknowledging the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil, is rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves the responsibility for evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} 

"[It is] deeply central to the whole tradition of Christian (and other western) religion that God is loving toward his creation and that involves him behaving in morally good ways toward it."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Within Christianity "God is supposed to be in some way personal... a being who is essentially eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, Creator and sustainer of the universe, and perfectly good. An omnipotent being is one who can do anything logically possible... such a being could not make me exist and not exist at the same time but he could eliminate the stars...  An omniscient being is one who knows everything logically possible for him to know... he will not necessarily know everything that will happen [i.e. humans with freewill] unless it is predetermined that it will happen..." &lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|3-15}} God's perfect goodness is moral goodness.&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|15}} "Western religion has always held that there is a deep problem about why there is pain and suffering--which there would not be if God were not supposed to be morally good... a personal being who was not morally good would not be the great being God is supposed to be... [Since theodicy is concerned with] the existence (or not) of the sort of God with which Western religion is concerned, this understanding of the definition of God must stand."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

==Reasons for theodicy==
German philosopher [[Max Weber]] interpreted theodicy as a social problem,&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed theodicy as a "problem of meaning". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly [[rationality|rational]], the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a "meaningful cosmos". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—[[predestination]], [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and [[karma]]—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead 2001, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Richard Swinburne says "most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==History==
The term ''theodicy'' was coined by German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work, written in [[French language|French]], ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz 1734&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ''Théodicée'' was a response to [[skepticism|skeptical]] Protestant philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], who wrote in his work ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the [[Bible]] asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ | title=Pierre Bayle | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=January 22, 2012 | author=Lennon, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Voltaire]] criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (''Poem on the Lisbon disaster''), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the [[Lisbon earthquake]] demonstrated that God was not providing the "best of all possible worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, [[Candide]] and ''Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne''&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel ''Candide''.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1992), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil "theodicies", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of [[natural theology]], meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm | title=Theodicy | publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia | year=2012 | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Kempf, Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, British philosopher [[John Hick]] published ''Evil and the God of Love'', in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, [[Augustinian theodicy|Augustinian]], which had dominated [[Western Christianity]] for many centuries, and [[Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean]], which was developed by the Eastern [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dialogue "Is God a Taoist?",&lt;ref&gt;Smullyan 1977, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1977 in his book ''[[The Tao is Silent]]'', [[Raymond Smullyan]] claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing "evil", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce "evil", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ancient religions===
“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, David (1989). ''God and Evil''. Hoboken: Ktav Pub. House. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Assman, Jan (2001). ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'' trans. David Lorton. Cornell University Press. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Philip Irving Mitchell of the [[Dallas Baptist University]] notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy.htm | title=Theodicy: An Overview | publisher=Dallas Baptist University | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Mitchell, Dr Philip Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Sarah Iles Johnston]] argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held [[polytheistic]] beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many [[deity|gods]] and [[goddess]]es who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued [[human]]ity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004, pp. 531–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Epicurean trilemma]]" however was already raised ~300BC by [[Epicurus]]. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.

====Biblical theodicy====
{{Main article|Theodicy and the Bible}}
The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the [[Book of Job]] is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Old Testament''. Modern Library Edition, Introduction, authored by George Steiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice ...beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty...  The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control."&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ko|first1=Grace|title=Theodicy in Habakkuk|date=2014|publisher=Paternoster|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

It is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy.&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21,28}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil, By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mark S. M.|title=Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil|date=2015|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-6470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}   

This is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}  Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as "the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

"Isaiah is generally recognized as one of the most progressive books of the prophetic corpus."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Linafelt|editor1-first=Tod|title=Strange Fire: Reading the Bible After the Holocaust|date=2000|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-5165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}}  Hebrew Bible scholar [[Marvin A. Sweeney]] says "...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront... [with] three major dimensions of the question...: Yahweh's identification with the conqueror, Yahweh's decree of judgment against Israel without possibility of repentance, and the failure of Yahweh's program to be realized by the end of the book."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"/&gt;{{rp|209}}  Christian theologians read some passages in Isaiah differently.   "In either case, suffering is understood as having transcendent meaning... human agency can give particular instances of suffering a mystical significance that transforms it into something productive."&lt;ref name="Sarah K. Pinnock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinnock|first1=Sarah K.|title=Beyond Theodicy: Jewish and Christian Continental Thinkers Respond to the Holocaust|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-5523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. "The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end--"the soul that sins shall die"--and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations." It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blenkinsopp|first1=Joseph|title=Ezekiel|date=1990|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-8042-3118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}  

"Theodicy in the Minor Prophets differs little from that in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel."&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redditt|first1=Paul L|title=Thematic Threads in the Book of the Twelve|date=2003|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=3-11-017594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the first chapter of Habakuk raises questions about Yahweh's justice, laments God's inaction in punishing injustice, and looks for God's action in response--then objects to what God chooses.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 1}} Instead of engaging in debate, God gives Habakuk a vision of the future which includes five oracles that form a theodicy: (1) God has a plan and has appointed a time for judgment.  It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues  (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people  (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Intro, Chapter 3}}  Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Psalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked.  The writer gains perspective when he "enters the sanctuary of God (16-17)" seeing that God's justice will eventually prevail.  He reaffirms his relationship with Yahweh, is ashamed of his resentment, and chooses trust. &lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 73}}  Psalm 77 contains real outspokenness to God as well as determination to hold onto faith and trust.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 77}} 

For the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Frame and Joseph E. Torres, Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2015), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human freewill, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm. ...the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|Intro.,51}} 

This is somewhat illustrated in the [[Book of Exodus]] when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics, Frame 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augustinian theodicy===
{{Main article|Augustinian theodicy}}
The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] reading of [[Augustinian theodicy]], as promoted primarily by [[John Hick]], is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=24 March 2000; substantive revision 12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a [[privation]]—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–78&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains that God remains blameless and good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]] reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the issue of [[just war]] as developed in his book [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine asserted that peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

===Irenaean theodicy===
{{Main article|Irenaean theodicy}}

[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;
Davis 2001, pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, [[John Hick]] collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a "vale of soul-making" (a phrase that he drew from [[John Keats]]), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origenian theodicy===
In direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither [[Augustine of Hippo]] nor [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the [[Church Fathers]] who articulated a theory of ''[[apokatastasis]]'' (or [[universal reconciliation]]), [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Mark (2012). ''Origen and the Problem of Evil'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relatively minor theodicies===
[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 436–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The Finite God Theodicy maintains that God is all-good ([[omnibenevolent]]) but not all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]).
:* The [[Best of all possible worlds|Best of all Possible Worlds]] Theodicy, a traditional theology, argues that the creation is the best of all possible worlds.
:* The [[Original Sin]] Theodicy holds that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin.
:* The Ultimate Harmony Theodicy justifies evil as leading to “good long-range consequences”.
:* The Degree of Desirability of a Conscious State Theodicy has been reckoned a “complex theodicy.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramblings of a Thomist, Blog of March 27, 2008 http://thomisticramblings.blogspot.com/2008/03/minor-theodicies-and.html. Accessed September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that a person’s state is deemed evil only when it is undesirable to the person. However, because God is unable to make a person’s state desirable to the person, the theodic problem does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 444–45. Martin finds this theodicy in George Schlesinger, ''Religion and Scientific Method'' (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012) and judges it unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[Reincarnation]] Theodicy believes that people suffer evil because of their wrong-doing in a previous life.
:* The Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
:* The Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

=== Islamic world ===

[[Mu'tazila]] theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of [[moral realism]], according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ayman Shihadeh|title=Suffering|editor=Josef W. Meri|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA772}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; They posited that individuals have free will to commit evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the [[Zaydi]] and [[Twelver]] branches of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Most Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] standpoint.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (''khalq'') from acquisition (''kasb'') of actions.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;{{cite book|title=What is Islamic Philosophy?|author=Roy Jackson|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of [[Al-Shahrastani]] (1086–1153):&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{quote|God creates, in man, the power, ability, choice, and will to perform an act, and man, endowed with this derived power, chooses freely one of the alternatives and intends or wills to do the action, and, corresponding to this intention, God creates and completes the action.}}

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

[[Ibn Sina]], the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, [[neoplatonic]] standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Philosophical Sufi theologians such as [[Ibn Arabi]] were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of [[Ibn Sina]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum "There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Religious Diversity, Evil, and a Variety of Theodicies |author=Michael L.

The [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]], whose writings became influential in [[Wahhabism]], argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts.&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Jon|last=Hoover|title=Ḥanbalī Theology|editor=Sabine Schmidtke|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199696703-e-014|subscription=yes|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that divine creation is good from a casual standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;

===Jewish anti-theodicy===
{{Main article|Holocaust theology}}
In 1998, Jewish theologian [[Zachary Braiterman]] coined the term anti-theodicy in his book ''(God) After Auschwitz'' to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to [[Job (religious figure)|Job's]] protests in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty &amp; Taliaferro 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs &amp; Wolfson 2002, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holocaust]] prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnock 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; French Jewish philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]], who had himself been a [[prisoner of war]] in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be "blasphemous", arguing that it is the "source of all immorality", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson &amp; Roth 2005, pp. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'', supports the "theology of protest", which he saw as presented in the play, ''[[The Trial of God]]''. He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the [[book of Job]], in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal 1993, pp. 250–51&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Richard L. ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, ''emunah'') in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of "holy protest" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham ([[Vayeira|Genesis 18]]) and Moses ([[Ki Tissa|Exodus 33]]), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: "Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy,&lt;ref&gt;''Über das Misslingen aller philosophischen Versuche in der Theodizee'' http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a viable practical theodicy is identified with [[Chabad messianism|messianism]]. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to Elie Wiesel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/ The original letter in Yiddish is found in R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ''Likutei Siḥot'', Vol. 33 (New York: Kehot, 1962–2001), pp. 255–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian alternatives to theodicy===
A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Billings, "Theodicy as a 'Lived Question': Moving Beyond a Theoretical Approach to Theodicy", http://www.luthersem.edu/ctrf/JCTR/Vol05/billings.htm Accessed September 25, 2013. About the author: http://www.westernsem.edu/about/faculty-staff/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Nick Trakakis]] observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.”&lt;ref&gt;Nick Trakakis, “Theodicy: The Solution to the Problem of Evil, or Part of the Problem?”, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/72023480656648g2/ Springerlink.com], accessed December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Musser and [[Joseph L. Price]], eds., ''A New Handbook of Christian Theology'' (Abingdon Press, 1992), s.v. “Tragedy.”&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Farley, ''Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: a Contemporary Theodicy'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1990) 12, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Katherine Pinnock, ''Beyond Theodicy'' (SUNY Press, 2002), 135, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Barth]] viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of [[divine providence]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'' (T &amp; T Clark, 1957), IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes "the idea of the goodness of God".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', III-1, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; For Barth, only the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion:&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Justification (theology)|justification of sinful humanity]] and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]] offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil", 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whale, J. S. The Christian answer to the problem of evil. 1948&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Mark Twain]] had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by [[Stephen Gottschalk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism" (Indiana University Press, 2006) 83, 123, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redemptive suffering]] based in Pope John Paul II's [[theology of the body]] embraces suffering as having value in and of itself.&lt;ref name="Adrian J. Reimers"&gt;{{cite article|last=Reimers|first=Adrian J.|title=Human Suffering and Jon Paul II's Theology of the Body|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~areimers/Suffering-JPII-expanded.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicprimer.org/papal/theology_of_the_body.pdf|title=Catholicprimer.org|website=www.catholicprimer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleonore Stump]] in "Wandering in Darkness" uses psychology, narrative and exegesis to demonstrate that redemptive suffering, as found in Thomistic theodicy, can constitute a consistent and cogent defence for the problem of suffering.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stump|first=Eleonore|title=Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=N.Y. New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-927742-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Free will defense===
{{see also|Theodicy and the Bible#Bible and free will theodicy}}
As an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] offers [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|a free will defense]] which argues that human [[free will]] sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.&lt;ref name="Ehrman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart D. Ehrman|title=God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question – Why We Suffer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOCx_wcDkbYC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-174440-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmodicy and anthropodicy&lt;!--'Anthropodicy' redirects here--&gt;===
A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the [[universe]] in the face of [[evil]], and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of [[human nature]] in the face of the evils produced by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Meiner, Kristin Veel, eds., ''The Cultural Life of Catastrophes and Crises'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2012), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;van der Ven 1989, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as "a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Devenish 1992, pp. 5–23&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:
{{quote|In classical terms, this is to broach the problem of theodicy: how to think about God in the face of the presence of suffering in God's creation. After God's dethronement as the subject of history, the question rebounds to the new subject of history: the human being. As a consequence, theodicy becomes anthropodicy – justifications of our faith in humanity as the subject of history, in the face of the suffering that is so inextricably woven into the history that humanity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley 2010, pp. 870–902&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Essential kenosis ====

Essential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as "open theism") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence|url = https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolling-Love-God-Relational-Providence/dp/0830840842/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257309&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uncontrolling+love+of+god|publisher = IVP Academic|date = 2015-12-06|isbn = 9780830840847|language = English|first = Thomas Jay|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Love: A Theology|url = https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Love-Dr-Thomas-Oord-ebook/dp/B003UD7QQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nature+of+love+oord|publisher = Chalice Press|date = 2010-04-10|language = English|first = Dr Thomas|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a "metaphysical dualism", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls "the power of love" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.&lt;ref name="Gijsbert van den Brink"&gt;{{cite book| last="van den Brink"| first=Gijsbert| title=Almighty God: A Study on the Doctrine of Divine Omnipotence| publisher=Kok Pharos publishing House| location=Kampen, the Netherlands|year=1993|pages=263–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">A '''tidal shock''' occurs when a [[star cluster]] or other distributed [[astronomical object]] passes by a large mass
such as an [[interstellar cloud]], resulting in [[gravitational perturbation]] on a time scale that is much less than the mean time for a star to complete an orbit within the cluster. The [[tidal force]] from this event can increase the dynamic energy of the cluster, in effect heating it up. This causes the cluster to expand and shed some of the outer stars.&lt;ref name=aj176_L51/&gt;

Tidal shocks occur, for example, when a [[globular cluster]] passes through the galactic plane or near the core of the [[Milky Way]]. These events are an important factor during the early evolution of a globular cluster. They work to truncate the outer part of clusters, thereby limiting the impact of future tidal shocks.&lt;ref name=lee2001/&gt; Streams of stars shed from a globular cluster as a result of tidal shock can form what are termed [[tidal tail]]s. These are extended streams of stars that lead away from the cluster.&lt;ref name=raa9_10_1131/&gt; Such streams can be used to trace the orbital path of the cluster.&lt;ref name=jkas35_2_75/&gt;

Exhaustively testing all combinations of an [[integrated circuit]] with 309 [[Input (computer science)|input]]s and 1 [[Output (computing)|output]] requires testing of a total of 2&lt;sup&gt;309&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of inputs. Since the number 2&lt;sup&gt;309&lt;/sup&gt; is a transcomputational number (that is, a number greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;), the problem of testing such a system of [[integrated circuit]]s is a transcomputational problem. This means that there is no way one can verify the correctness of the circuit for all combinations of inputs through [[Brute-force search|brute force]] alone.&lt;ref name="Klir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miles|first=William|title=Bremermann's Limit|url=http://www.wmiles.com/2010/01/bremermanns-limit|accessdate=1 May 2011}} While the source uses 308 as the number of inputs, this number is based on an error: 2&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pattern recognition===
Consider a ''q''&amp;times;''q'' array of the [[chessboard]] type, each square of which can have one of ''k'' [[color]]s. Altogether there are ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[color]] [[pattern]]s, where ''n'' = ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The problem of determining the best classification of the patterns, according to some chosen criterion, may be solved by a search through all possible color patterns. For two colors, such a search becomes transcomputational when the array is 18&amp;times;18 or larger. For a 10&amp;times;10 array, the problem becomes transcomputational when there are 9 or more colors.&lt;ref name="Klir"/&gt;

This has some relevance in the physiological studies of the [[retina]]. The retina contains about a million [[Light sensitivity|light-sensitive]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. Even if there were only two possible states for each cell (say, an active state and an inactive state) the processing of the [[retina]] as a whole requires processing of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;300,000&lt;/sup&gt; bits of information. This is far beyond [[Bremermann's limit]].&lt;ref name="Klir"/&gt;

===General systems problems===
A [[system]] of ''n'' variables, each of which can take ''k'' different states, can have 
''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; possible system states. To analyze such a system, a minimum of ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bits of information are to be processed. The problem becomes transcomputational when ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;. This happens for the following values of ''k'' and ''n'':&lt;ref name="Klir"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''k'' || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10
|-
| ''n'' || 308 || 194 || 154 || 133 || 119 || 110 || 102 || 97 || 93
|}

==Implications==
The existence of real-world transcomputational problems implies the limitations of computers as data processing tools. This point is best summarized in Bremermann's own words:&lt;ref name="Bre"/&gt;

:"The experiences of various groups who work on problem solving, theorem proving and [[pattern recognition]] all seem to point in the same direction: These problems are tough. There does not seem to be a royal road or a simple method which at one stroke will solve all our problems. My discussion of ultimate limitations on the speed and amount of data processing may be summarized like this: Problems involving vast numbers of possibilities will not be solved by sheer data processing quantity. We must look for quality, for refinements, for tricks, for every ingenuity that we can think of. Computers faster than those of today will be a great help. We will need them. However, when we are concerned with problems in principle, present day computers are about as fast as they ever will be.

:We may expect that the technology of data processing will proceed step by step – just as ordinary technology has done. There is an unlimited challenge for ingenuity applied to specific problems. There is also an unending need for general notions and theories to organize the myriad details."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">In [[biology]], '''trimorphism''' is the existence in certain [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s of three distinct forms, especially in connection with the [[reproductive organ]]s. 

In trimorphic plants there are three forms, differing in the lengths of their [[Carpel|pistils]] and [[stamen]]s, in size and color of their [[pollen]] grains, and in some other respects; and, as in each of the three forms there are two sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils.  These organs are so proportioned in length to each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level with the stigma of the third form.  To obtain full [[fertility]] with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the one should be fertilized by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in another form.  Hence six unions are legitimate, that is, fully fertile, and 12 are illegitimate, or more or less unfertile.  Wallace has shown that the females of certain butterflies from the [[Malay Archipelago]] appear in three conspicuously distinct forms without intermediate links.

In [[crystallography]], ''trimorphism'' refers to the occurrence of certain forms in [[mineral]]s which have the same [[chemical composition]], but are referable to three systems of [[crystallization]].

[[File:Proton Prevé RESS (Reinforced Safety Structure) (03).jpg|thumb|right| [[Proton Prevé]] with unibody construction]]

A '''vehicle frame''', also known as its ''[[chassis]]'', is the main supporting [[structure]] of a [[motor vehicle]], to which all other components are attached, comparable to the [[skeleton]] of an [[organism]].

Until the 1930s virtually every car had a structural frame, separate from its body. This construction design is known as ''[[body-on-frame]]''. Over time, nearly all passenger cars have migrated to [[Coachbuilder#Unibody construction|unibody construction]], meaning their chassis and bodywork have been integrated into one another. 

Nearly all [[truck]]s, buses, and most [[Pickup truck|pickups]] continue to use a separate frame as their chassis.

==Functions==
The main functions of a frame in motor vehicles are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nBVefxD_0agC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=The+main+functions+of+an+automobile+frame |page=410 |title=A textbook of automobile engineering |first=R. K. |last=Rajput |publisher=Laxmi Publications |year=2007 |isbn= 9788170089919 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To support the vehicle's mechanical components and body
# To deal with static and dynamic loads, without undue deflection or distortion.
:These include:
::*Weight of the body, passengers, and cargo loads.
::*Vertical and torsional twisting transmitted by going over uneven surfaces.
::*Transverse lateral forces caused by road conditions, side wind, and steering the vehicle.
::*Torque from the engine and transmission.
::*Longitudinal tensile forces from starting and acceleration, as well as compression from braking.
::*Sudden impacts from collisions.

Types of frame according to the construction:
::* Ladder type frame 
::*X-Type frame
::*Off set frame
::* Off set with cross member frame
::*Perimeter Frame

==Frame rails==

[[File:1956truckframe.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pickup truck]] frame. Notice hat-shaped crossmember in the background, c-shape rails and cross member in center, and a slight arc over the axle.]]
Typically the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames is [[Steel#Carbon steels|carbon steel]]; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction. In the case of a separate chassis, the frame is made up of [[structural element]]s called the ''rails'' or [[Beam (structure)|''beams'']]. These are ordinarily made of steel ''channel'' sections, made by folding, rolling or pressing steel plate.

There are three main designs for these. If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped (U-shaped) results.
"Boxed" frames contain chassis rails that are closed, either by somehow welding them up, or by using premanufactured [[Hollow structural section|metal tubing]].

&lt;big&gt;'''C-shape'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By far the most common, the C-channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another. It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in thickness from 1/8" to 3/16") and rolling both sides over to form a c-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hat'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hat frames resemble a "U" and may be either right-side-up or inverted with the open area facing down. Not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust, however they can be found on 1936–1954 [[Chevrolet]] cars and some [[Studebaker]]s.
[[File:Chassis (4689544258).jpg|thumb|High performance custom frame, using boxed rails and tube sections]]
Abandoned for a while, the hat frame gained popularity again when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, in effect creating a boxed frame.

&lt;big&gt;'''Boxed'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Originally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube. Modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet.

In the 1960s, the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot-welded here and there down the seam; when turned into NASCAR "stock car" racers, the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength.

===Design features===
[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|right|thumb|Pickup truck chassis holding the vehicle's engine, drivetrain, suspension, and wheels]]
While appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal, frames encounter great amounts of stress and are built accordingly. The first issue addressed is '''beam height''', or the height of the vertical side of a frame. The taller the frame, the better it is able to resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame. This is the reason [[truck|semi-trucks]] have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker.

As looks, ride quality, and handling became more important to consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running straight over both [[axle]]s, arched frames sit lower—roughly level with their axles—and curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing, but don't curve down on the other side, and are more common on front ends.

Another feature seen are tapered rails that narrow vertically and/or horizontally in front of a vehicle's cabin. This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same frame rail. For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.

On ''perimeter'' frames, the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating what is known as ''torque boxes''.

==Types==

===Ladder frame===
[[File:Developed ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and lightening holes (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and [[lightening holes]]]]
So named for its resemblance to a ladder, the ladder frame is one of the simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks.  This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the [[floor pan]] sitting above the frame instead of inside it.

The term '''unibody''' or '''unit body''' is short for '''unitized body''', or alternatively ''unitary construction'' design. It is &lt;blockquote&gt;A type of body/frame construction in which the body of the vehicle, its floor plan and chassis form a single structure. Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=unit body |work=engineering-dictionary.org |url= http://www.engineering-dictionary.org/Unit_body  |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Traditional [[body-on-frame]] architecture has shifted to the lighter unitized body structure that is now used on most cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/shift-unitized-body-no-slam-dunk |title=Shift to Unitized Body No Slam Dunk |date=1 September 2008 |first=Bill |last=Visnic |work=Wards Auto |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last UK mass-produced car with a separate chassis was the [[Triumph Herald]], which was discontinued in 1971.

Integral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame. In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle—forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or by a combination of these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a [[monocoque]] structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still ribs, bulkheads and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description [[semi-monocoque]] more appropriate.

The first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the 1922 [[Lancia Lambda]] to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its [[Torpedo (car)|torpedo car]] body.&lt;ref name="Genta"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KxTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Probably+the+first+attempt+to+develop+such+an+architecture+was+done+with+the+1922+Lancia+Lambda |pages=23–26 |title=The Motor Car Past, Present and Future |first=Giancarlo |last=Genta |first2=Lorenzo |last2=Morello |first3=Francesco |last3=Cavallino |first4=Luigi |last4=Filtri |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=9789400785519 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lambda though its open layout, with unstressed roof, made it less a ''monocoque'' shell and more a bowl - 11,000 were produced.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/news/a17656/from-the-carriage-trade-to-carbon-fiber/ |title=From the Carriage Trade to Carbon Fiber All about an automobile's body/chassis |publisher=Road and Track |first=Dennis |last=Simanaitis |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key role in developing the unitary body was played by the American firm the Budd Company, now [[Budd Company#Automobiles|ThyssenKrupp Budd]].&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; Budd supplied pressed-steel bodywork, fitted to separate frames, to automakers [[Dodge]], [[Ford]], [[Buick]], and the French company, [[Citroën]].  

In 1930, [[Joseph Ledwinka]], an engineer with Budd, designed an automobile prototype with full unitary construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagley.org/librarynews/automobile-engineer-joseph-ledwinka |publisher=Hagley Museum and Library  |title=Joseph Ledwinka |author= |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citroën]] purchased this fully unitary body design for the [[Citroën Traction Avant]]. This high volume, mass production car was introduced in 1934 and sold 760,000 units over the next 23 years of production.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; This application was the first iteration of the modern structural integration of body and chassis, using spot welded deep stamped steel sheets into a structural cage, including sills, pillars and roof beams.&lt;ref name="Genta"/&gt; In addition to a unitary body with no separate frame, the Traction Avant also featured other innovations such as four-wheel [[independent suspension]], and [[front-wheel drive]]. The result was a low-slung vehicle with an open, flat-floored interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiconline.com/news/20-cars-changed-automotive-industry-forever |title=20 Cars that Changed the Automotive Industry Forever|publisher=Magic Online|author= |date=13 October 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Chrysler Airflow]] (1934–1937) Budd supplied a variation - three main sections from the Airflow's body were welded into what Chrysler called a bridge-truss construction. For the Chrysler Airflow unfortunately, this method was not ideal - panel fits were poor.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt; To convince a skeptical public of the strength of ''unibody'' both Citroën and Chrysler created advertising films showing cars surviving after being pushed off a cliff.&lt;ref name="R&amp;T"/&gt;

[[Opel]] was the second European and the first German car manufacturer to produce a car with unibody structure - production of the compact [[Opel Olympia|Olympia]] started in 1935. A larger [[Opel Kapitän|Kapitän]] went into production in 1938, although its front longitudinal beams were stamped separately and then attached to the main body.

The streamlined 1936 [[Lincoln-Zephyr]] with conventional [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] utilized a unibody structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://theoldmotor.com/?p=131195 |title=The Designs of John Tjaarda Result in the 1936 Lincoln Zephyr |date=27 December 2014 |publisher=The Old Motor |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, unit construction was no longer a new idea for cars, "but it was unheard of in the [American] low-price field [and] [[Nash Motors|Nash]] wanted a bigger share of that market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3dBsrwHxxq8C&amp;q=Unit+construction+wasn't+a+new+idea+in+1941,+but+it+was+unheard+of+in+the+low-price+field.+Nash+wanted+a+bigger+share+of+that+market,+and+its+all-new+unibody+600+series |page=54|title=Great cars of the forties |author=''Consumer Guide'' Auto Editors |publisher=Louis Weber |date=1985 |isbn=9780881762808 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://retrorambling.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/great-american-cars-of-the-forties-1941-nash-600/ |title=Great American Cars Of The Forties – 1941 Nash 600 |date=8 July 2014 |first=Tidious |last=Ted |work=Retrorambling |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single unit body construction of the [[Nash 600]] provided weight savings and Nash's Chairman and CEO, [[George W. Mason]] was convinced "that unibody was the wave of the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BkBWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22single+unit%22+body+construction.+Weight+savings+realized+on+the+1941+Nash+600+convinced+Mason+that+unibody+was+the+wave+of+the+future.+He+wanted+real+and+distinct+product+advantages |page=33 |title=My Mother's Compact Car: Twenty Years Of Rambler |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=2 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narus"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E7KhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Unibody+was+the+big+news.+The+600+was+unique |page=27 |title=Nash, 1939-1954 |first=Donald J. |last=Narus |publisher=New Albany Books |year=2012 |isbn=9781467521246 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then more cars were redesigned to the unibody structure, which is now "considered standard in the industry".&lt;ref name="Narus"/&gt; By 1960, unitized body design was used by Detroit's Big Three on their compact cars ([[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Plymouth Valiant]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair]]). After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form [[American Motors]], its Rambler-badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody.

Although the 1934 [[Chrysler Airflow]] had a weaker than usual frame and body framework welded to the chassis to provide stiffness, in 1960, Chrysler moved from body-on-frame construction to a unit-body design for most of its cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/body/unit-body.html |title=Chrysler moves to Unibody (unit-body construction): 1960 |work=allpar.com |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the American-manufactured unibody automobiles used [[torque boxes]] in their vehicle design to reduce vibrations and chassis flex, with the exception of the [[Chevy II]] which had a bolt-on front apron (erroneously referred to as a subframe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ask.cars.com/2008/10/what-is-unibody.html |title=What is unibody construction? |work=Ask.Cars.com |first=Joe |last=Bruzek |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Motors (with its partner [[Renault]]) during the late-1970s incorporated unibody construction when designing the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] platform using the manufacturing principles (unisides, floorpan with integrated frame rails and crumple zones, and roof panel) used in its passenger cars, such as the [[AMC Hornet|Hornets]] and all-wheel-drive [[AMC Eagle|Eagles]] for a new type of frame called the "Uniframe ... a robust stamped steel frame welded to a strong unit-body structure, giving the strength of a conventional heavy frame with the weight advantages of Unibody construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Iem-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=In+engineering+the+XJ+Jeeps,+Roy+Lunn+and+his+team+came+up+with+a+new+type+of+frame+called+the+Uniframe+a+strong+unit-+body+structure,+giving+the+strength+of+a+conventional+heavy+frame+with+the+weight+advantages+of+Unibody+construction |page=124 |title=Jeep: The History of America's Greatest Vehicle |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |year=2014 |isbn=9781627882187 |publisher=Motorbooks |accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was also used with the XJC concept developed by American Motors prior to its absorption by Chrysler, which later became the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ)]]. —including modern day sport utility vehicles ([[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] et al.).  

The ''unibody'' is now the preferred construction for mass market automobiles and [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]]. This design provides weight savings, improved space utilisation, and ease of manufacture. Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two [[energy crises]] of the 1970s and the [[2000s energy crisis|2000s]] where compact SUVs using a truck platform (primarily the USA market) were subjected to CAFE standards after 2005 (by the late-2000s truck-based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers). An additional advantage of a strong-bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers.

===Backbone tube===
{{main article|Backbone chassis}}
A backbone chassis is a type of automobile construction chassis that is similar to the body-on-frame  design. Instead of a two-dimensional ladder type structure, it consists of a strong tubular backbone (usually rectangular in cross section) that connects the front and rear suspension attachment areas. A body is then placed on this structure.

===X-frame===
[[File:Chassis (4689544886).jpg|thumb|Rolling X-frame chassis]]
This is the design used for the full-size American models of General Motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment, each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle. It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps, since each row had to cover frame rails as well. Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame.

The X-frame was claimed to improve on previous designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side-impact and collision protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-an-x-ray-look-at-gms-x-frame-1957-1970/ |title=Automotive History: An X-Ray Look At GM's X Frame (1957 – 1970) |first=Paul |last=Niedermeyer |date=19 January 2012 |website=Curb Side Classic |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This design was replaced by perimeter frames.

===Perimeter frame===
[[File:Anadol FW11 prototype chassis.jpg|thumb|[[Reliant FW11|Anadol FW11]] prototype with perimeter frame]]
Similar to a ladder frame, but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails just behind the rocker / sill panels. This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for [[body-on-frame]] cars in the United States, but not in the rest of the world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no perimeter frame automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its fourth generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).

In addition to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety in the event of a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, and is used in combination with torque boxes and soft suspension settings.

===Platform frame===

}}
This is a modification of the perimeter frame, or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor, have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for extra strength and rigidity. Neither floor pieces are simply sheet metal straight off the roll, but have been stamped with ridges and hollows for extra strength.

Platform chassis were used on several successful European cars. The most well-known of this is the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], on which it is called body on pan construction. Another German example are the [[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|Mercedes-Benz "Ponton"]] cars of the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4743728-Mercedes-Benz-190SL-the-Teutonic-T-bird-is-born-1954 |title=Thread: Mercedes Benz 190SL, the "Teutonic T-bird" is born, 1954... |publisher=vwvortex.com |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was called a "frame floor" in English-language advertisements.

The French [[Renault 4]] of which over eight million were made, also used a platform frame. The frame of the [[Citroen 2CV]] represents a more minimal interpretation of a platform chassis.

===Space frame===
{{main article|Space frame#Cars}}
In a (tubular) spaceframe chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a three-dimensional skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. In order to maximise rigidity and minimise weight, the design makes maximum use of triangles, and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive, never bending, so they can be kept as thin as possible.
[[File:Jaguar C-Type Frame.JPG|thumb|right|Jaguar C-Type frame]]
The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the  1930s by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[William Bushnell Stout]] (the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]] and the [[Stout Scarab]]) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150" &gt;{{Cite book |title=Colin Chapman: Inside the Innovator |last=Ludvigsen |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=1-84425-413-5 |ref={{harvid|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman}} |pages=150–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1951 [[Jaguar C-Type]] [[sports car racing|racing sports car]] that won the [[Le Mans 24 hours]] twice, had a lightweight multi-tubular, triangulated frame, over which an aerodynamic aluminium body was crafted.

The Italian term ''[[Superleggera]]'' (meaning "super-light") was trademarked by [[Carrozzeria Touring]] for lightweight sports-car body construction that ''only resembles'' a space-frame chassis. Using a three-dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin is attached to the outside of the frame and is often made of aluminium. This body construction is however ''not'' stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis.
[[File:Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 chassis - Flickr - J.Smith831.jpg|thumb|The Lamborghini Aventador has a carbon fibre central monocoque, with front and rear steel subframes, mounting the mechanicals]]

===Subframe===
{{main article|Subframe}}
A subframe is a distinct structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure. Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle high chassis forces and can transfer them evenly to a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell. Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars, and are used to attach the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] to the vehicle.  A subframe may also contain the [[Engine#Modern|engine]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. It is normally of box steel construction, but may be tubular.

Examples of passenger car use include the 1967–1981 [[GM F platform]], the numerous years and models built on the [[GM X platform (1962)]], GM's M/L platform vans(Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, which included an all-wheel drive variant), and the unibody [[AMC Pacer]] that incorporated a front subframe to isolate the passenger compartment from engine, suspension, and steering loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5gSgvG7JNp0C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=Subframe+cars |pages=123–124 |title=Hot rodder's bible |first=Gerry |last=Burger |first2=Steve |last2=Hendrickson |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=9780760307670 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hpRWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=AMC+Pacer+smooth+and+quiet+ride+can+probably+be+attributed+to+a+front+subframe+that+isolates+the+passenger+capsule+from+engine,+suspension+and+steering+loads |page=24 |title=AMC Pacer station wagon |journal=Car and Driver |volume=22 |year=1977 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[Raw sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] in the [[New River (California)|New River]] as it passes from [[Mexicali]] to [[Calexico, California]]]]
'''Water pollution''' is the contamination of [[Body of water|water bodies]], usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[marine pollution|ocean]]s, [[aquifer]]s and [[groundwater]]. Water pollution results when [[Contaminant|contaminants]] are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated [[wastewater]] into natural water bodies can lead to [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[aquatic ecosystems]]. In turn, this can lead to [[public health]] problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or [[irrigation]]. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]].&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Water pollution can be grouped into [[surface water]] pollution. [[Marine pollution]] and [[nutrient pollution]] are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a [[storm drain]], [[wastewater treatment plant]] or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as [[Surface runoff|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted [[bodies of water|water bodies]] can be impacted. The effects can damage individual [[species]] and impact the natural [[Biocoenosis|biological communities]] they are part of.   

The causes of water pollution include a wide range of [[chemical]]s and [[pathogen]]s as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of [[thermal pollution]] is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic" /&gt;{{rp|375}}   

Water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriate [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]] and management plans. The infrastructure may include [[wastewater treatment plants]]. [[Sewage treatment|Sewage treatment plants]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. [[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for farms, and [[erosion control]] from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. [[Nature-based solutions]] are another approach to prevent water pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Canal-pollution.jpg|thumb|Pollution in the [[Lachine Canal]], Canada]]
Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] contaminants. Due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use, such as [[drinking water]], or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as [[volcano]]es, [[algae bloom]]s, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of [[water resource policy]] at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |author=Pink, Daniel H. |publisher=Yahoo |title=Investing in Tomorrow's Liquid Gold |date=April 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423172532/https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/a/waterdayqa.htm |author=West, Larry |publisher=About.com |title=World Water Day: A Billion People Worldwide Lack Safe Drinking Water |date=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt; 

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in [[India]] die of water pollution related illness (including [[waterborne diseases]]) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |title=An overview of diarrhea, symptoms, diagnosis and the costs of morbidity |year=2010 |work=CHNRI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231350/http://www.inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 percent of the [[Water resources of China|water in the cities of China]] is polluted.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/07/content_449451.htm China says water pollution so severe that cities could lack safe supplies]". Chinadaily.com.cn. June 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, half a billion Chinese had no access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Joseph |last2=Yardley |first2=Jim |date=2007-08-26 |title=As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in [[developing country|developing countries]], [[developed countries]] also continue to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on [[water quality]] in the [[United States]] in 2009, 44 percent of assessed stream miles, 64 percent of assessed lake acres, and 30 percent of assessed [[bays]] and [[estuary|estuarine]] square miles were classified as polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=Fact Sheet: 2004 National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Surface water pollution ===
{{see also|Nutrient pollution}}
Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is [[marine pollution]].

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|thumb|upright|A polluted river draining an abandoned [[copper mine]] on Anglesey]]

One common path of entry by [[Contaminant|contaminants]] to the sea are rivers. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations.  

Large [[gyre]]s ([[vortex]]es) in the oceans trap floating [[plastic debris]]. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning any creature that eats it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaikab|first=Gwyneth Dickey|date=2011-03-28|title=Marine microbes digest plastic|url=|journal=Nature|publisher=Macmillan|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1038/news.2011.191|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. This results in obstruction of digestive pathways, which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation.

There are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant, but a derivative condition. An example is [[silt]]-bearing [[surface runoff]], which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column, hampering [[photosynthesis]] in aquatic plants.

===Groundwater pollution===
{{Main|Groundwater pollution}}
Interactions between [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, also referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution.&lt;ref name="circ1139" /&gt; By its very nature, groundwater [[aquifer]]s are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. The distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. 

Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on [[soil]] characteristics and site geology, [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], and the nature of the contaminants. Causes of groundwater pollution include: naturally-occurring (geogenic), [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems, [[sewage]], [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]], commercial and industrial leaks, [[hydraulic fracturing]], [[landfill leachate]].

==Categories of pollution sources==
Surface water and [[groundwater]] have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (1998). [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] Circular 1139.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. Conversely, groundwater can also feed surface water sources. Sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin.

===Point sources===
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Point source pollution at a [[shipyard]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.]]

{{Further|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

[[Point source water pollution]] refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, such as a [[water pipe|pipe]] or [[ditch]]. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]], a factory, or a city [[storm drain]]. 

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) defines point source for [[regulation|regulatory]] enforcement purposes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA), section 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}} (14).&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-point sources===
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. This type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. A common example is the leaching out of [[nitrogen]] compounds from fertilized agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Brian |title=Water Pollution by Agriculture |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B |date=2008 |volume=363 |pages=659–666 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2176 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Moss2/publication/6173580_Water_Pollution_by_Agriculture/links/53d607050cf220632f3d6bf2.pdf|pmc=2610176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient [[surface runoff|runoff]] in [[stormwater|storm water]] from "sheet flow" over an [[agricultural field]] or a forest are also cited as examples of non-point source pollution.

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Contaminated storm water washed off of [[parking lot]]s, roads and highways, called [[urban runoff]], is sometimes included  under the category of non-point sources. However, because this runoff is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters, it becomes a point source.

==Contaminants and their sources==
{{Further|Wastewater|Sewage|Industrial wastewater}}

The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of [[chemical]]s, [[pathogen]]s, and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring ([[calcium]], [[sodium]], iron, [[manganese]], etc.) the [[concentration]] usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna.

[[Oxygen]]-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the [[gill]]s of some fish species.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact"&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] Fact Sheet No. EPA-841-F-05-001. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in [[pH]]), [[electrical conductivity]], temperature, and [[eutrophication]]. Eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an [[ecosystem]] to an extent that increases the [[Primary production|primary productivity]] of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.

===Pathogens===

Disease-causing [[microorganism]]s are referred to as [[pathogen]]s. Pathogens can produce [[waterborne diseases]] in either human or animal hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kFbRYQUqcAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0854046216&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=0-85404-621-6|editor1-last=Harrison|editor1-first=Roy M.|edition=4th|location=Cambridge, UK|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coliform bacteria]], which are not an actual cause of disease, are commonly used as a [[indicator bacteria|bacterial indicator]] of water pollution.

High levels of pathogens may result from on-site [[sanitation]] systems ([[septic tank]]s, [[pit latrine]]s) or inadequately treated [[sewage]] discharges.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/sso/control/diseases.htm “Illness Related to Sewage in Water.”] Accessed February 20, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427093431/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/sso/control/diseases.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older cities with ageing infrastructure may have leaky sewage collection systems (pipes, pumps, valves), which can cause [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.

Pathogen discharges may also be caused by poorly managed livestock operations.

===Organic, inorganic and macroscopic contaminants===
Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Many of the chemical substances are [[toxic]].&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5D2DQAAQBAJ|title=Aquatic Pollution&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; An Introductory Text|last=Laws|first=Edward A.|date=2018|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119304500|edition=4th|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229}}

===Change in temperature===
{{Main|Thermal pollution}}
Thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in a change in the physical properties of water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate= |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate= |pages=415–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"/&gt;{{rp|375}} Urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-additional-resources |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=February 2003 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Fact Sheet. EPA 841-F-03-003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers.

==Measurement==
[[File:Research- water sampling equipment.jpg|thumb|right|[[environmental science|Environmental scientists]] preparing water autosamplers.]]

Water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Most involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests. Some methods may be conducted ''[[in situ]]'', without sampling, such as temperature. Government agencies and research organizations have published standardized, validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book |editor1-last=Baird |editor1-first=Rodger B. |editor2-last=Clesceri |editor2-first=Leonore S. |editor3-last=Eaton |editor3-first=Andrew D. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rice |editor4-first=Eugene W. |year=2012 |title=Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater |edition=22nd |url=http://www.standardmethods.org |subscription=yes |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Public Health Association |isbn=978-0875530130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason "grab" samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] intervals.

Sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. Depending on the type of assessment, the organisms may be identified for [[biosurvey]]s (population counts) and returned to the water body, or they may be dissected for [[bioassay]]s to determine [[toxicity]].
{{Further|Water quality#Sampling and measurement}}

===Physical testing===
Common physical tests of water include temperature, solids concentrations (e.g., [[total suspended solids]] (TSS)) and turbidity.

===Chemical testing===
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|environmental chemistry}}
Water samples may be examined using the principles of [[analytical chemistry]]. Many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. Frequently used methods include [[pH]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD),&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|title=Chemistry of the Environment|year=2008|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0-8160-7747-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD),&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;{{rp|104}} nutrients ([[nitrate]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds), metals (including copper, [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], lead and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]), oil and grease, total [[petroleum]] hydrocarbons (TPH), and [[pesticide]]s.

===Biological testing===
{{Main|Bioindicator}}
Biological testing involves the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They are any [[indicator species|biological species]] or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a group of bio-indicators are the [[copepod]]s and other small water [[crustacean]]s that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.

==Control of pollution==
===Municipal wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment|Wastewater treatment}}
[[File:Deer Island MA.JPG|right|thumb|[[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant|Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant]] serving Boston, Massachusetts and vicinity.]]
In urban areas of developed countries, municipal [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) is typically treated by centralized [[sewage treatment plants]]. Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., with secondary treatment steps or more advanced treatment) can remove 90 percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. Some plants have additional systems to remove [[Nutrient|nutrients]] and pathogens, but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive.

[[Nature-based solutions]] are also being used instead of (or in combination with) centralized treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s or [[Combined sewer|combined sewer overflows]] employ one or more [[environmental engineering|engineering]] approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage, including:
* utilizing a [[green infrastructure]] approach to improve storm water management capacity throughout the system, and reduce the [[hydraulic]] overloading of the treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2010 |title=Green Infrastructure Case Studies |chapter=Case Study: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100FTEM.txt |publisher=EPA |pages=49–51 |id=EPA-841-F-10-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* repair and replacement of leaking and malfunctioning equipment&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;
* increasing overall hydraulic capacity of the sewage collection system (often a very expensive option).

=== On-site sanitation and safely managed sanitation ===
{{Further|Sanitation}}
Households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual [[septic tank]], which pre-treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. This can lead to [[groundwater pollution]] if not properly done.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people currently (in 2017) do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]], according to an estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of [[open defecation]]: during rain events or floods, the [[human feces]] are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple [[pit latrines]] may also get flooded during rain events. The use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
{{Main article|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
[[File:REDOX DAF unit 225 m3-h-1000 GPM.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dissolved air flotation]] system for treating industrial wastewater.]]
Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove the pollutants, and then discharge the partially treated [[wastewater]] to the municipal sewer system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants, through a process called [[pollution prevention]].

To remove heat from wastewater generated by [[Power station|power plants]] or [[Factory|manufacturing plants]] the following technologies are used:
*[[cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through [[evaporation]] or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=50000H5P.txt |publisher=EPA |date=September 1997 |id=EPA/310-R-97-007 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
'''Non point source controls'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) washed off fields is the largest source of [[agricultural pollution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact" /&gt; Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops and installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS-NCPS"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

Nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) are typically applied to farmland as commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/integrated-pest-management-ipm-principles |title=Integrated Pest Management Principles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Pest Control and Pesticide Safety for Consumers |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|thumb|Feedlot in the United States]]
'''Point source wastewater treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
Farms with large livestock and poultry operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, are called ''concentrated animal feeding operations'' or ''feedlots'' in the US and are being subject to increasing government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Des Moines, IA. [http://www.iowadnr.gov/afo/ "Animal Feeding Operations in Iowa."] Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal [[slurry|slurries]] are usually treated by containment in [[anaerobic lagoon]]s before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with [[straw]] and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Erosion and sediment control from construction sites===
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Silt fence]] installed on a construction site.]]
Sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of:
* [[erosion control]]s, such as [[mulch]]ing and [[hydroseeding]], and
* [[sediment control]]s, such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Nashville, TN (2012). [http://tnepsc.org/handbook.asp "Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of:
* spill prevention and control plans, and
* specially designed containers (e.g. for concrete washout) and structures such as overflow controls and diversion berms.&lt;ref&gt;

===Control of urban runoff (storm water)===
{{Main|Urban runoff}}
{{See also|Green infrastructure}}
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|right|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for controlling [[urban runoff]]]]
Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] (BMPs) in the U.S., may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS"&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]] techniques, installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |title=Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219220712/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |archive-date=2015-02-19 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, constructed [[wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association.

Thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;{{Rp|p. 5–58|date=May 2012}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
The standard deviation of wind direction is a measure of lateral [[turbulence]] and is used in a method for estimating the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes|Pasquill stability category]] in air pollution dispersion.

The simple method for calculating standard deviation requires two passes through the list of values. The first pass determines the average of those values; the second pass determines the sum of the squares of the differences between the values and the average. This double-pass method requires access to all values. A [[Standard deviation#Rapid calculation methods|single-pass method]] can be used for normal data but is unsuitable for [[Polar coordinate system|angular]] data such as wind direction where the 0°/360° (or ±180°) discontinuity forces special consideration. For example, the directions 1°, 0°, and 359° (or −1°) should not average to the direction 180°.

The Yamartino method, introduced by Robert J. Yamartino in 1984, solves both problems. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has chosen it as the preferred way to compute the standard deviation of wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/met/mmgrma.pdf Meteorological Monitoring Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications (section 6.2.1)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A further discussion of the Yamartino method, along with other methods of estimating the standard deviation of wind direction can be found in Farrugia &amp; Micallef.

It is possible to calculate the exact standard deviation in one pass. However, that method needs slightly more calculation effort.

==Algorithm==
Over the time interval to be averaged across, ''n'' measurements of wind direction (''θ'') will be made and two totals are accumulated without storage of the ''n'' individual values. At the end of the interval the calculations are as follows: with the average values of sin&amp;nbsp;''θ'' and cos&amp;nbsp;''θ'' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;s_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the average wind direction is given via the four-quadrant arctan(x,y) function as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\arctan(c_a,s_a).&lt;/math&gt;

From twenty different functions for ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; using variables obtained in a single-pass of the wind direction data, Yamartino found the best function to be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \arcsin (\varepsilon) \left[1+\left(\tfrac 2 {\sqrt 3} -1\right) \varepsilon^3\right], &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\sqrt{1-(s^2_a+c^2_a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key here is to remember that sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' = 1 so that for example, with a constant wind direction at any value of ''θ'', the value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; will be zero, leading to a zero value for the standard deviation.
 
The use of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; alone produces a result close to that produced with a double-pass when the dispersion of angles is small (not crossing the discontinuity), but by construction it is always between 0 and 1.  Taking the [[arcsine]] then produces the double-pass answer when there are just two equally common angles: in the extreme case of an oscillating wind blowing backwards and forwards, it produces a result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians, i.e. a [[right angle]].  The final factor adjusts this figure upwards so that it produces the double-pass result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an almost uniform distribution of angles across all directions, while making minimal change to results for small dispersions.

The theoretical maximum error against the correct double-pass ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore about 15% with an oscillating wind. Comparisons against Monte Carlo generated cases indicate that Yamartino's algorithm is within 2% for more realistic distributions.

A variant might be to weight each wind direction observation by the wind speed at that time.
