'''''Allegory to the Element Earth''''' is a painting by the Venetian Renaissance artist [[Leandro Bassano]] of about 1580, now in [[The Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].

==History==
In the 16th century the world was thought to consist of four elements, each associated with the four seasons.  Air was attributed to spring, fire to summer, earth to autumn, and water to winter.  In 1648 a written work by Carlo Ridolfi records that Leandro Bassano's father, [[Jacopo Bassano|Jacopo]], painted a series of allegories of the four elements for a prince.  The series was likely installed in a single room of a palace or villa.  The replica, presented here, is believed to have been painted by Leandro Bassano at his father's studio.  The elder Bassano and his sons were the first in Italian art to fill their works with common subjects and natural details.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=M.S.|title=Masterpieces of Italian Painting|year=2005|publisher=The Trustees of the Walters Art Gallery|pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
In this work representing the element earth, several workers gather and carry fruits, vegetables, and game.  The ancient Roman goddess of fertility, [[Cybele]], drives across the sky in a wagon pulled by lions.  The structure on the left alludes to a setting of a nobleman's villa.  The table is draped with an oriental carpet and covered with sweets, fruits, and wine.  The presence of these objects indicates that the land being worked by the servants does not belong to them.  Several animals are also represented throughout the painting and are shown in coexistence despite their variety.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

==Analysis==
The classical ideals, mythology, and architectural elements represented in the painting suggest that it was created for an audience familiar with the [[humanistic]] focus on the ancient world.  The coexistence of a variety of animals represented in the painting hints at an Eden-like state.  The dark scenery provided the artist the opportunity to create dramatic light and shade with rich oil paints.  The colors standout dramatically against the dark shadows, a technique known as [[chiaroscuro]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

==Off the Wall==
''Allegory of the Element Earth'' was featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, in 2012.  A reproduction of the painting was on display at the Whole Foods Market on Smith Avenue.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |title=Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall |access-date=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |archive-date=2012-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Gallery, London]] began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;[Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, The Baltimore Sun, September 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apple Design Awards''' (also known as the '''ADA''') is a special event hosted by [[Apple Inc.]] at its annual [[Worldwide Developers Conference]]. The event is meant to recognize the best and most innovative [[Macintosh]] and [[iOS]] [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] produced by [[independent software vendor|independent developers]], as well as the best and most creative uses of Apple's products. The ADAs, as they are commonly known, are awarded in a variety of categories which vary from year to year. The Apple Design Awards have been presented each year since 1996, though for the first two years of their existence they were known as the '''Human Interface Design Excellence (HIDE) Awards'''.

Since 2003 the physical awards were designed with an Apple logo that glows when touched. The trophy is an aluminum cube, and each side is 3.9 inches (or 10 cm) long. The cube weighs 55.5 ounces (1575 grams)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pixelmator|title=Apple Design Award|url=http://www.pixelmator.com/ada/|accessdate=2018-04-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731173705/http://www.pixelmator.com/ada/|archivedate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Bahman Mirza Qajar Mausoleum ''' — is a mausoleum with 3 domes located 25 meters north-east from [[Imamzadeh Mausoleum (Barda)|Imamzadeh architectural complex in Barda]].

==Design==
This architectural monument is one of the rare types in Arran's architectural style to be built with baked bricks. Its domes are consolidated from both inside and outside. Bahman Mirza Qajar was buried in the third room from entrance, which is also middle of the last room. The grave is built of a kind of tomb style. There are six inscriptions on the black marble on the inner walls of the dome. The texts are written in plain text, and the texts are related to the verses of the Koran: The life of the buried man is described as full of agony, frustration, longing, and shaking.

==Bahman Mirza==
The person buried in the grave is Bahman Mirza, scientist and historian from the Qajar dynasty. Bahman Mirza bin Naib As-Sultan Abbas Mirza, was the son of a prince. According to Raudet Uc-Safayi Nasiri, he was fourth in the age group of 26 surviving sons of [[Abbas Mirza]]. He was born in 1810. In his work, Tazgireyi Mohammed-Shahi, it is noted that at the time of his youth, his father appointed him ruler of [[Ardabil]]. According to the author's own note, this book was written with the request of his brother, [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]], in 1835–1836. There is also a few poems left in the Persian language. According to some sources, Bahman Mirza had been the ruler of Persian Azerbaijan since 1842. He didn’t stay in this post for a long time. His nephew [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] was appointed to this post. In the meantime, Nasiraddin, the new ruler of Azerbaijan ordered the removal of eyes of Bahman Mirza. Having seen the situation, Bahman Mirza rushed to the Russian navigator and wanted shelter from him. The ambassador received him very well and allowed Bahman to live in Russia. On May 12, 1848, he arrived in Baku with the Lankaran ship. On May 15, he went to Shamakhi from Baku. Bahman Mirza, who was looking for a permanent place of residence, didn’t stay here, came to Tiflis on May 20 to live. At that time, his work ended in the Iranian era, the era of Azerbaijan began. On May 28, his 7 wives and 19 children from these wives were brought to Nakhchivan, after which they were sent to Tiflis, to heads of the family.

According to some reports, seeing him expatriate, his brother, Naser al-Din Shah, understood his mistake, pardoned him, and asked him to return. But Bahman did not come back again. Bahman Mirza was unable to live in Tiflis for a long time and bought the property of Malikbekov, who moved from Shusha on October 4, 1851, and stayed there with his family and lived in this city. Though he lived in Shusha, he took an active part in the cultural events of Karabakh. He often came to Barda, one of the oldest cities in Azerbaijan. During his 24 years in Karabakh, he began to write his new novel "Shukurnamei Shahanshahi". In this work, he described the sequence of historical events of the period from [[Genghis Khan]] to the XIX century. The work was completed in 1871. Having seen the old age, the scientist built a mausoleum for himself in Barda, 1880, and ordered his sons to bury him in the mausoleum. He died on February 11, 1884. His sons buried him in the mausoleum that was 25 meters east from Imamzadeh.

Bahman Mirza's had library of about 38,000 books. Currently, some of these books are kept in Tbilisi, and the rest are kept in libraries in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Yerevan. Several books from his library are in the Institute of Manuscripts of the Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences. Manuscripts of Bahman Mirza's "Tazgireyi Mohammed - Shahi" and "Shukurnamei - Shahshanshah" are preserved there. Those books and manuscripts have been confirmed by Bahman Mirza's own seal and signature.

At present, the villages of "Boyuk Qajar" and "Bala Qajar" in the Barda region are formed of his descendants. Later his sons served as high-ranking officers in the Russian army. His four generals and four colonel sons were in military service in Russia and Iran. His son, who died in the Russian-Japanese war in 1904, was buried next to his father, Bahman Mirza Qajar. In recent years, the mausoleum has been restored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12303">[[File:65th venice film festival.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Venice International Film Festival]] is part of the [[Venice Biennale]]. The famous [[Golden Lion]] is awarded to the best film screening at the competition.]]
'''Biennale''' ({{IPA-it|bi.enˈnaːle|pron}}), [[Italian language|Italian]] for "biennial" or "every other year", is any event that happens every two years. It is most commonly used within the [[art world]] to describe large-scale international [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. As such the term was popularised by [[Venice Biennale]], which was first held in 1895. The phrase has since been used for other artistic events, such as the "[[Biennale de Paris]]", "[[Kochi-Muziris Biennale]]", or even as a [[portmanteau]] as with [[Berlinale]] (for the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]) and [[Vienna International Film Festival|Viennale]] (for [[Vienna]]'s international film festival). "Biennale" is therefore used as a general term for other recurrent international events (such as triennials, [[Documenta]], [[Skulptur Projekte Münster]]).

== Characteristics ==
According to author Federica Martini, what is at stake in contemporary biennales is the diplomatic/international relations potential as well as urban regeneration plans. Besides being mainly focused on the present (the “here and now” where the cultural event takes place and their effect of "spectacularisation of the everyday"), because of their site-specificity cultural events may refer back to, {{Who|date=July 2017}} produce or frame the history of the site and communities' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;Vittoria Martini e Federica Martini, ''Just another exhibition.

[[Image:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|The Great Exhibition in [[The Crystal Palace]] in Hyde Park, London, in 1851, the first attempt to condense the representation of the world within a unitary exhibition space.]]
A strong and influent symbol of biennales and of large-scale international exhibitions in general is the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], the gigantic and futuristic London architecture that hosted the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition in 1851]]. According to philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]],&lt;ref&gt;Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} the Crystal Palace is the first attempt to condense the representation of the world in a unitary exhibition space, where the main exhibit is society itself in an a-historical, spectacular condition. The Crystal Palace main motives were the affirmation of British economic and national leadership and the creation of moments of spectacle. In this respect, 19th century World fairs provided a visual crystallization of colonial culture and were, at the same time, forerunners of contemporary theme parks.

=== The Venice Biennale as an archetype ===
[[File:Map of Venice Biennial.pdf|thumb|left|The structure of the Venice Biennale in 2005 with an international exhibition and the national pavilions.]]
The [[Venice Biennale]], a periodical large-scale cultural event founded in 1895, served as an archetype of the biennales. Meant to become a [[World Fair]] focused on [[contemporary art]], the Venice Biennale used as a pretext the wedding anniversary of the Italian king and followed up to several national exhibitions organised after Italy unification in 1861. The Biennale immediately put forth issues of city marketing, cultural tourism and urban regeneration, as it was meant to reposition Venice on the international cultural map after the crisis due to the end of the [[Grand Tour]] model and the weakening of the Venetian school of painting. Furthermore, the Gardens where the Biennale takes place were an abandoned city area that needed to be re-functionalised. In cultural terms, the Biennale was meant to provide on a biennial basis a platform for discussing contemporary art practices that were not represented in fine arts museums at the time. The early Biennale model already included some key points that are still constitutive of large-scale international art exhibitions today: a mix of [[city marketing]], internationalism, [[gentrification]] issues and destination culture, and the spectacular, large scale of the event.

=== Biennales after the 1990s ===
The situation of biennials has changed in the contemporary context: while at its origin in 1895 Venice was a unique cultural event, but since the 1990s hundreds of biennials have been organized across the globe. Given the ephemeral and irregular nature of some biennials, there is little consensus on the exact number of biennials in existence at any given time. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Furthermore, while Venice was a unique agent in the presentation of contemporary art, since the 1960s several museums devoted to contemporary art are exhibiting the contemporary scene on a regular basis. Another point of difference concerns 19th century internationalism in the arts, that was brought into question by post-colonial debates and criticism of the contemporary art “ethnic marketing”, and also challenged the Venetian and World Fair’s national representation system. As a consequence of this, Eurocentric tendency to implode the whole word in an exhibition space, which characterises both the Crystal Palace and the Venice Biennale, is affected by the expansion of the artistic geographical map to scenes traditionally considered as marginal. The birth of the Havana Biennial in 1984 is widely considered an important counterpoint to the Venetian model for its prioritization of artists working in the Global South and curatorial rejection of the national pavilion model.

'''Black women filmmakers''' have contributed to the filmmaking industry across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn Audrey. ''Women Filmmakers of the African &amp; Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity'' (SUI: 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), 2&lt;/ref&gt; There are disputes concerning whom the first black women filmmaker is, but the earliest director with undisputed evidence is [[Zora Neale Hurston]], who created the film ''Children's Games'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks-Betram|first1=Peggy|title=Drusilla Dunjee Houston|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/drusilla-dunjee-houston-2/|website=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=12 April 2018|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Black women filmmakers==
The film industry has been difficult for black women to break into. According to Nsenga Burton, writer for ''The Root'', "the film industry remains overwhelmingly white and male."&lt;ref name="root"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/black-women-and-hollywood-shuffle |title=Black Women and the Hollywood Shuffle |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121132639/http://www.theroot.com/views/black-women-and-hollywood-shuffle |archivedate=2010-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her book ''Black Women Film and Video Artists'', Jacqueline Bobo notes that "there is a substantial body of work created by Black women film/video makers, extending back to the early part of this century. Unfortunately, the work is overlooked not only by many distributors, but also by critical reviews and scholarly analyses, with the notable exception of those by Black women scholars, have been few and far between."&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. Black Women Film &amp; Video Artists. New York: Routledge, 1998. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the issues concerning the involvement of Black females in film making is not simply the involvement or lack in numbers, but the influence given to them. As Ada Gay Griffin examines in ''Seizing the Moving Image'' the issues in telling a Black story in film cannot be resolved by adding a couple of black actors or hiring black crews to produce the film, but by seizing control of the image as Griffin argues and this is done by gaining production ownership of the films which can be done by Black women gaining more [[Studio executive|Studio Executive]] positions in the film industry which is severely lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Popular Culture|last=Wallace|first=Michele|publisher=Bay Press|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56584-459-9|location=Seattle|pages=231-233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when looking at [[Hollywood]]'s industry Black women filmmakers become the most unnoticeable, they become existent only in the periphery of the industry. In other words, it may be somewhat apparent that Black women filmmakers are small in numbers but the fact of the matter is that there are many black woman filmmakers that are actively contributing to the film industry.

Jacqueline Bobo, an associate professor in the women's studies program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, argues that the general public sees Black women's works as small, irregular works of interest to small circle of intimate friends.&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. ''Black Women Film &amp; Video Artists''. New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Jacqueline Bobo establishes that black women filmmakers have been productive throughout the twentieth century. Dating back to the 1900s, black women filmmakers have created a ''Genesis of a Tradition.'' Through Gloria J Gibson-Hudson's essay titled "The Ties That Bind: Cinematic Representations By Black Women Filmmakers," she notes that these black women have developed a framework or "commonalities" that evolved from social and historical circumstances. 

Documentation exists of Black women producing and directing films during the prolific interim of Black film production from 1910 through the 1920s. Archivist and film scholar Pearl Bowser notes that Black women worked behind the camera on numerous films during this time on what were known as "race" films, that is, independent films produced by Black filmmakers, rather than white-controlled films about Black life. Historical records show that two women were especially noteworthy in filmmaking during this period. [[Madame C.J. Walker]], one of the first Black millionaires, made her fortune manufacturing and distributing cosmetics and hair-care products for Black women. In addition to her retail business, Walker owned the Walker Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana and produced training and promotional films about her cosmetics factory. The theater still stands today and was recently purchased by IUPUI for renovations. These films, Bowser declares, "offered a visual record of women's work history" and the "development of cottage Industries." Bowser also points to the importance of Madam Toussaint Welcome, Booker T. Washington's personal photographer, who produced at least one film about Black soldiers who fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. ''Black Women Film &amp; Video Artists''. New York: Routledge, 1998, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s other pioneer Black female filmmakers included [[Zora Neale Hurston]], a folklorist who created work centering on ethnographic films. Zora Hurston earned her MA in Cultural Anthropology at Columbia University. The film ''Children's Games,'' was directed by Hurston, and is the first non-silent film to be directed by a black woman.&lt;ref&gt;Bobo, Jacqueline, ed. ''Black Women Film &amp; Video Artists''. New York: Routledge, 1998, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Eslanda Goode Robeson is another 1930's pioneer regarding Black female filmmakers. She too held a Ph.D. in anthropology and made ethnographic films similar to Hurston's reels.  Similar to Hurston's films, they are available for viewing at the Library of Congress but their fragile conditions renders it inaccessible for public screening.

In 1991, [[Julie Dash]] became the first black female filmmaker to have a full-length general theatrical release in the US for her film ''Daughters of the Dust''. The film was recognized in 1999 by the 25th annual Newark Black Film Festival as one of the most important cinematic achievements in black cinema in the 20th century. ''Daughters of the Dust'' was placed on the National Film Resgistry by the Library of Congress in 2004, making it one of 400 other American-made films that are preserved and protected as national treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julie Dash|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/julie-dash-41|website=www.thehistorymakers.org|publisher=The HistoryMakers|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ava DuVernay]], a pioneer of black female filmmakers, became the first black woman to win the US Dramatic Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. She received an Oscar nomination for her documentary ''[[13th (film)|13th]]'', and has also made history as the first black woman director to be nominated for a Golden Globe. DuVernay continued her career in filmmaking with her most recent film [[A Wrinkle in Time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wrinkle in Time|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/?ref_=nv_sr_1|website=www.imdb.com|publisher=IMDB.com, Inc|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2018 with an estimated budget surpassing $100 million, which makes DuVernay the first black female to direct a live-action film with that large of a budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Casey|title=Ava DuVernay is the First African-American Woman to Direct a $100 Million Film|url=http://time.com/4438223/ava-duvernay-100-million-film/|website=www.time.com|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is set to direct ''[[New Gods]]'', a Warner Bros. and DC Comics film, in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMDb|title=The New Gods - Internet Movie Database tt8145762|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8145762/|website=IMDb|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bristol board''' (also referred to as '''Bristol paper''' or '''Super white paper''') is an [[Woodfree uncoated paper|uncoated]], machine-finished [[paperboard]]. It is named after the city of [[Bristol]] in the southwest of [[England]] as that is where it was first produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mixed Media Superstar: All About Bristol Board|url=https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-bristol-board/|publisher=Craftsy|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sizes include {{cvt|22+1/2|×|28+1/2|in|mm|0}} and its bulk thickness is {{convert|0.006|in|mm}} or higher&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-bristolpaper.htm About.com: Desktop Publishing].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ISO 216|A4, A3, A2 and A1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series Daler Rowney] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831062219/http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series |date=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/Paper_and_Pads.html Goldline pads included in product listings]&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol board may be rated by the number of [[wikt:ply|plies]] it contains or, in Europe, by its [[grammage]] of 220 to 250&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is normally white, but is also made in different colours.

==Applications==
Bristol paper is used for printing documents, [[brochures]], promotional materials and [[envelopes]]. It is often used for water color painting. It is also used for [[paperback]] book or catalog covers, [[file folders]], tags, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets]]. Another use is for scale models; some students use this kind of paper for the walls in their scale models. One-ply Bristol is thin enough to be translucent, and two and three ply bristol are the most popular thicknesses. 

Bristol board is commonly used for [[technical drawing]], [[illustration]] projects, [[comic book]] art, and other two-dimensional art forms. It provides two working surfaces, front and back. This quality separates it from illustration board, which has only a front working surface. 

The surface texture is either '''plate''' or '''vellum'''. ''Plate'' finish is as smooth as glass{{fact|date=November 2018}}, and is very good for pen and ink. ''Vellum'' (or ''kid'') finish is a medium texture more appropriate to friction-based media, such as crayon, chalks, or charcoal. A third finish, ''engravers'' or ''wedding'', may be used for formal [[engraving|engraved]] wedding invitations.

A '''burial vault''' is a structural underground [[tomb]].{{commonscat|Burial vaults}}

It is a stone or brick-lined underground space or 'burial' chamber for the interment of a [[death|dead]] body or bodies. These burial tombs were originally and are still often [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and usually have stone slab entrances. They are often privately owned and used for specific family or other groups, but usually stand beneath a public religious building, such as a [[church architecture|church]], or in a [[churchyard]] or [[cemetery]]. A [[crypt]] may be used as a burial vault.

[[Chess]] became a source of inspiration in the arts in literature soon after the spread of the game to the [[Arab World]] and [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The earliest works of art centered on the game are [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in medieval manuscripts, as well as poems, which were often created with the purpose of describing the [[rules of chess|rules]]. After chess gained popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries, many works of art related to the game were created. One of the most well-known,&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt; [[Marco Girolamo Vida]]'s ''Scacchia ludus'', written in 1527, made such an impression on the readers that it singlehandedly inspired other authors to create poems about chess.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt;

In the 20th century, artists created many works related to the game, sometimes taking their inspiration from the life of famous players ([[Vladimir Nabokov]] in ''[[The Defense]]'') or  well-known games ([[Poul Anderson]] in ''Immortal Game'', [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] in ''[[The Squares of the City]]''). Some authors invented new [[chess variant]]s in their works, such as [[Games of the Discworld#Stealth Chess|stealth chess]] in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series or [[Three-dimensional chess#Tri-Dimensional Chess|Tri-Dimensional chess]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

==History==

===10th to 18th century===
[[File:Alfonso-LJ-27V.jpg|thumb|Some of the earliest examples of chess-related art are [[Middle Ages|medieval]] illustrations accompanying books or manuscripts, such as this [[chess problem]] from the 1283 ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'']]
[[File:The Chess Game - Sofonisba Anguissola.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sofonisba Anguissola]], ''The Chess Game,'', 1555, [[National Museum, Poznań]], [[Poland]]]]
Palatine Chapel in the Norman Palace in [[Palermo]] you can admire the first painting of a chess game that is known to the world. The work dates from around 1143 and the artists who created the Muslims were chosen by the Norman king of Sicily Roger II of Hauteville, who erected the church.
The earliest known reference to chess in a European text is a [[Medieval Latin]] poem, ''[[Versus de scachis]]''. The oldest manuscript containing this poem has been given the estimated date of 997.&lt;ref name=Speculum&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gamer |first1=Helena M. |year=1954 |title=The Earliest Evidence of Chess in Western Literature: The Einsiedeln Verses |journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] |publisher= |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages= 734–750|url= |doi= 10.2307/2847098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples include [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] accompanying books. Some of them have high artistic value. Perhaps the best known example is the 13th-century ''[[Libro de los juegos]]''. The book contains 151 illustrations, and while most of them are centered on the board, showing [[chess problem|problems]], the players and architectural settings are different in each picture.&lt;ref name=Golladay-p657&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etd.library.arizona.edu/etd/GetFileServlet?file=file:///data1/pdf/etd/azu_etd_2444_1_m.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf |title=Los Libros de Acedrex Dados E Tablas: Historical, Artistic and Metaphysical Dimensions of Alfonso X’s Book of Games |author=Sonja Musser Golladay |year=2007 |work= |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=6 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717133812/http://etd.library.arizona.edu/etd/GetFileServlet?file=file%3A%2F%2F%2Fdata1%2Fpdf%2Fetd%2Fazu_etd_2444_1_m.pdf&amp;type=application%2Fpdf# |archive-date=2011-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces illustrating chess problems in [[Luca Pacioli]]'s manuscript ''[[De ludo scacchorum]]'' ({{lang-la|On the Game of Chess}}) (c. 1500), described as "futuristic" even by today's standards,&lt;ref name=Winnipeg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32762994.html |title=Experts link Leonardo da Vinci to chess puzzles in Renaissance treatise |author= |date=14 March 2008 |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have been designed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=Winnipeg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;{{cite news

|title=Renaissance chess master and the Da Vinci decode mystery |author=[[Raymond Keene]] |date=10 March 2008 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After chess became gradually more popular in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially in Spain and Italy, many artists began writing poems using chess as a theme.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p11&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scachs d'amor]]'' ({{lang-ca|Chess of love}}), written by an unknown artist in the end of the 15th century, describes a game between [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], using chess as an [[allegory]] of love. The story also serves as a pretence to describe the rules of the game. ''De ludo scacchorum'' (unrelated to the manuscript mentioned above) by {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Bernardino Caldogno|it}}, also created at that time, is a collection of gameplay advice, presented in poetic fashion.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p12&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Terni Scacchi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terniscacchi.com/scacchi-scuola/scacchi-elenco-romanzi-racconti.htm |title=Elenco romanzi e racconti sul gioco degli scacchi |trans-title=List of novels and short stories on chess |author= |date= |work=Terni Scacchi |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2010|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  works of chess-related art is [[Marco Girolamo Vida]]'s ''Scaccia ludus'' (1527), centered on a game played between [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] on [[Mount Olympus]]. It is said that, because of its high artistry, the poem made a great impression on anyone who read it, including [[Desiderius Erasmus]].&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt; It also directly inspired at least two other works.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p14&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The first is [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s poem ''[[Chess (poem)|Chess]]'' (c. 1565), which describes the game as a battle between two armies, while the second is [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones']]'' [[William Jones (philologist)#Latin chess poem|Caissa, or the game of chess]]'' (1772).

=== 19th century onwards ===
Since the 19th century, artists have been creating novels and – since the 20th century – films related to chess. Sometimes, they are inspired by famous games, like [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s ''[[The Squares of the City]]'', structured after the famous match between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Mikhail Chigorin]]; [[Poul Anderson]]'s short story ''Immortal Game'', inspired by [[Immortal Game|the 1851 game]] played by [[Adolf Anderssen]] and [[Lionel Kieseritzky]] (which also appears in the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''); or [[Waldemar Łysiak]]'s ''Szachista'' ({{lang-pl|The Chess Player}}), centered on a game played between [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[The Turk]]. The game [[Poole – HAL 9000|Frank Poole versus HAL 9000]] from the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' is also based on an actual match, albeit not widely known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1254321&amp;kpage=1 Roesch vs Willi Schlage (1910)] in [[chessgames.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists drawn their inspirations from the life of players. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] wrote ''[[The Defense]]'' after learning about [[Curt von Bardeleben]],&lt;ref name=Krabbe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_1.htm |title=Open chess diary 1-20 (entry 3) |author=[[Tim Krabbé]] |date= |work=Tim Krabbé's blog |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' was loosely based on the life of [[Bobby Fischer]].&lt;ref name=musical&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/08/theater/theater-does-anyone-make-a-bad-move-in-chess.html |title=Does Anyone Make a Bad Move In 'Chess'? |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=8 May 1998 |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors invented new [[chess variant]]s in their works, such as [[Games of the Discworld#Stealth Chess|stealth chess]] in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series or [[Three-dimensional chess#Tri-Dimensional Chess|Tri-Dimensional chess]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

One unusual connection between art and chess is the life of [[Marcel Duchamp]], who almost fully [[Marcel Duchamp#Transition from art to chess|suspended his artistic career]] to focus on chess in 1923.

==Community Parades==

Occurring in late October on the Saturday before [[Halloween]], ''Night of Dread'' is an annual community event in which giant puppets and images of fears are paraded through the streets and then burned in a bonfire at Dufferin Grove Park with live music, dancing and [[fire spinning]].

'''''Dead Man Walking''''' is the first [[opera]] by [[Jake Heggie]], with a [[libretto]] by [[Terrence McNally]]. Based on the [[Dead Man Walking (book)|book of the same name]] by Sister [[Helen Prejean]], [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille|C.S.J.]], the work premiered on October 7, [[2000 in music#Opera|2000]], at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], produced by the [[San Francisco Opera]].

==Performance history==
The 2000 premiere production was commissioned by then-General Director [[Lotfi Mansouri]] and the stage director was [[Joe Mantello]]. Sets, costumes and lighting were designed by Michael Yeargen, Sam Fleming, and [[Jennifer Tipton]], respectively. 

The Australian premiere and first performance outside the United States&lt;ref name=shmith&gt;Michael Shmith, "The sister of mercy", ''Sunday Age'', 17 August 2003, Agenda, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; took place in August 2003 at the [[State Opera of South Australia]], with [[Teddy Tahu Rhodes]] as Joseph De Rocher and [[Kirsti Harms]] as Sister Helen.  Helen Prejean was in the audience.&lt;ref name=shmith/&gt; The production was nominated for six [[Helpmann Awards]], winning two: "Best Set Design" and "Best Male in an Operatic Performance". The opera has since been performed numerous times across the United States and in other countries.

The Canadian premiere took place in January 2006 in Calgary, Alberta, with [[Daniel Okulitch]] in the role of Joseph De Rocher. The European premiere was given in May 2006 at the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden, Germany. The same production had its opening night on September 26, 2007, at the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna and also played at the [[Malmö Opera]] in Malmö, Sweden. In 2007 it was revived for limited run at the State Theatre in Sydney and that same year was given its university and Rocky Mountain regional premiere at the University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;ref&gt;Blomster, Wes (19 October 2007). [http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13089935 "CU Opera presents regional premiere of Heggie's 'Dead Man Walking'"]. ''[[Daily Camera]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was also produced in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, by the [[Union Avenue Opera Company]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Lavazzi, [http://www.timocel.com/walking_KDHX.html "''Dead Man Walking'' at Union Avenue Opera]", Operatic St. Louis / KDHX, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A new orchestration of the opera, for 31 musicians, prepared under Jake Heggie's direction, was premiered at the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] Theater in San Francisco in February 2015 by Opera Parallèle.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, Alan (24 February 2015).

== Synopsis ==
:Place: [[Louisiana]]
:Time: 1980s

'''Prologue:''' A teenage boy and a teenage girl are parked near a secluded lake at night, on a date. They have the radio on in their car, and are [[making out]] to its music. The De Rocher brothers, hiding nearby, emerge from the shadows, quietly. One turns the radio off; the two brothers attack the teens. Anthony grabs the boy, who begins struggling; Joseph attacks the girl and begins to [[rape]] her. The boy continues struggling until Anthony shoots him once, at the base of the skull, [[Execution-style murder|execution-style]]; this causes the girl to scream. In a panic, Joseph stabs her until she is silent.

=== Act 1 ===
''Scene 1: Hope House, Sister Helen's mission, run by the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]]''

Sister Helen, with the aid of some of the other sisters, is teaching the children a [[hymn]]; this hymn, "He Will Gather Us Around", becomes Helen's [[leitmotif]] during the course of the opera. After the children leave, Helen reveals to her colleagues that she has heard from an inmate on death row with whom she has been corresponding. He has asked her to be his spiritual adviser through his execution, and she has decided to accept. The sisters are shocked, warning Helen of the dangers of her position, but she is firm.

''Scene 2: The drive to the prison''

Helen drives to [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (Angola) and muses on her acceptance of De Rocher's request. She is stopped by a motorcycle policeman for speeding, but he lets her off with a warning after a short humorous soliloquy; "I never gave a ticket to a nun before. Gave a ticket to an IRS agent once… got audited that year. Tell you what…"

''Scene 3: Angola State Prison''

Helen arrives at the prison and is met by Father Grenville, the prison chaplain, who conducts her inside.

''Scene 4: Father Grenville's office''

Father Grenville criticizes Sister Helen's choice to work with De Rocher, claiming that the man is unreachable; he tells her that she's in over her head. Helen responds that it is her duty to attempt to help the man. Father Grenville leaves her to meet with Warden Benton, who asks many of the same questions and also criticizes her decision. He conducts her to [[Death Row]] to meet with De Rocher.

''Scene 5: Death Row''

Warden Benton and Sister Helen walk through Death Row to reach the visiting room. They're heckled by the inmates (chorus) who in turn shout profanities at her and ask her to say prayers for them.

''Scene 6: Death Row visiting room''

Warden Benton conducts De Rocher into the visiting room. He is friendly and easy-going. They converse; he asks her to speak at the pardon board [[hearing (law)|hearing]] on his behalf to have his sentence commuted to life. He seems convinced that she will not return to help him; she assures him that such is not the case.

''Scene 7: The pardon board hearing''

Sister Helen is present with De Rocher's mother and two of his younger brothers, who plead with the pardon board on his behalf. One of Joseph's victims' parents lashes out at her in anger.

''Scene 8: The courthouse parking lot''

The four parents of De Rocher's victims speak angrily to his mother and to Sister Helen, who tries to calm both sides. The parents accuse her of not understanding their pain and sorrow. Word comes from the pardon board; De Rocher has not been granted commutation. Barring [[intercession]] from the [[governor]] for clemency, he is to die for his crime.

''Scene 9: Death Row visiting room''

De Rocher is convinced that Helen has abandoned him; she enters, late, and tells him that she has not and will not. He is angry and rejects all her suggestions to confess and make peace with his actions. The warden enters and tells Helen to leave at once.

''Scene 10: The prison waiting room''

Helen is trying to find money to buy food from the vending machine, having forgotten to eat. She begins to hear the voices, in her head, of the parents, the children at Hope House, Father Grenville, the motorcycle policeman, Warden Benton, and her colleagues, all telling her to stop trying to help De Rocher. The warden enters to tell her that the governor has refused to act to save him, and gives Helen some money for the machine. She stands for a moment, then faints.

=== Act 2 ===
''Scene 1: Joseph De Rocher's prison cell''

A guard enters and tells De Rocher, who is doing pushups, that his [[Capital punishment|execution]] date has been set for August 4. The guard leaves; Joseph muses on his fate.

''Scene 2: Sister Helen's bedroom''

Helen wakes up in terror from a nightmare, alarming Sister Rose, who begs her to stop working with De Rocher. Rose reminds her that she has not slept well since she began helping him. Helen says she cannot; the two women pray for the strength to forgive De Rocher.

''Scene 3: Joseph's cell''

It is the evening of the date set for the execution. De Rocher and Sister Helen are talking; they discover they share a common love for [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]. For the first time he admits that he is afraid. She reassures him, urging him to confess and make peace with what he has done; again he refuses. The warden enters and informs them that his mother is there to see him.

''Scene 4: The visiting room''

Mrs. De Rocher and her two younger sons have arrived. Joseph visits with them, and tries to apologize; she does not hear him, preferring to believe to the end that he is innocent. She complains that she baked him cookies, but was not allowed to bring them in. She asks Helen to take a last picture of the four of them together with the [[camera]] in her [[Handbag|purse]]. The guards lead Joseph away; she looks after him, reminiscing, near tears, eventually losing control. She thanks Helen for all that she has done; Helen promises to take the cookies for her.

''Scene 5: Outside the Death House''

Helen speaks with the victims' parents. One of them, Owen Hart, takes her aside and confesses that he is less sure of what he wants now than he was; he tells her that he and his wife have separated due to the stress they have felt. Helen tries to console him; they agree to part as "Fellow victims of Joseph De Rocher".

''Scene 6/7: Joseph's holding cell''

Helen and De Rocher converse for the last time; she asks him to confess to the murders. This time, something in him snaps; he breaks down and tells her the entire story. He expects Helen to hate him; instead, she says she forgives him, and that she will be "the face of love" for him. He thanks her. Father Grenville enters and begins the final preparations for the execution.

''Scene 8: March to the [[execution chamber]]/The execution chamber''

Guards, inmates, the warden, the parents, the chaplain, and protesters assembled outside the prison sing the [[Lord's Prayer]] as Sister Helen reads a passage from the [[book of Isaiah]]. They approach the death chamber, and Helen is separated from De Rocher. The warden asks if he has any last words; he says he does, and asks forgiveness from the parents of the murdered teenagers. The warden gives the nod, and the execution proceeds. De Rocher dies thanking Helen once again for her love; the opera ends as she stands over his body and sings her hymn one last time.

== Critical reaction ==
Critical reaction to the opera was generally favorable; in particular, critics praised the sharp, finely delineated performances by the principals and the simple yet effective production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.culturalresuena.es/2018/02/dead-man-walking-jake-heggie/|title=¿Venganza o perdón?

Many also found that McNally's [[libretto]] to be among the most finely crafted in recent memory: "the splendid libretto – by turns plainspoken and eloquent, with wonderful splashes of wry humor to lighten the tone when it most needs it – creates the structural backbone of this wrenching drama".&lt;ref name="SFG" /&gt; Although not all of it has been set to music, McNally gave the libretto to Heggie with the express instructions to use whatever portions of it he felt necessary, and to discard the rest.

'''''Drowned Land''''' is a 1912 [[oil painting|oil sketch]] by the 20th-century Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].

The work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the [[Mississagi River]]. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]] in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into a full-time painting.

==Background==
{{Further|Tom Thomson#Exploring Algonquin Park (1912–13)|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#First ventures to Algonquin Park (1912–13)}}

In 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two month expedition up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today [[Mississagi Provincial Park]]).{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}} Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip,{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}} the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain [[squall]] and the second in a series of rapids.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{efn|group=note|Thomson would write to his friend M. J. (John) McRuer: {{quote|[...] 

We started in at Bisco and took a long trip on the lakes around there going up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and over into the Mississauga &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississagi River|Mississagi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; water we got a great many good snapshots of game—mostly moose and some sketches, ''but'' we had a dump in the forty-mile rapids which is near the end of our trip and lost most of our stuff—we only saved 2 rolls of film out of about 14 dozen. Outside of that we had a peach of a time as the Mississauga is considered the finest canoe trip in the world.

==Analysis==

{{See also|Tom Thomson#Industry in nature|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Photography}}

Thomson's art director while at [[Grip Ltd.]], Albert Robson, identified ''Drowned Land'' as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=6}} [[Art history|Art historian]] David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on [[Lake Scugog]] or near [[Owen Sound]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} It was painted with [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[paper]], which was further embossed with [[canvas]] texture, all mounted on [[plywood]]. A similar support was used for ''View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses''.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=146}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Near Owen Sound.jpg|thumb|''Near Owen Sound'', November 1911. [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]]]

The painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 24]}} It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, ''Near Owen Sound'', in terms of colour, drawing and [[Texture (painting)|texture]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}} On display is a "camera-like precision" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that ''Drowned Land'' as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their "uncanny precision."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#photography 63]}} The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as ''The Canoe'' and ''Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park''. These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of [[Topography|topographers]] in the early-nineteenth century.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}

The painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=29}} Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, [[Pointer boat|pointers]], [[Alligator boat|alligators]] and [[Log driving|drives]],{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} the presence of industry being on his mind from early on.{{sfnb|Reid|1971|pp=2–10}} ''Drowned Land'' however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

'''''Gomorrah''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''Gomorra''''') is a [[non-fiction]] [[Investigative journalism|investigative]] book by [[Roberto Saviano]] published in 2006, which documents Saviano's infiltration and investigation of various areas of business and daily life controlled or affected by [[Organized crime in Italy| criminal organization]] [[Camorra]].

==The book==
The book describes the clandestine particulars of the [[business]] of the [[Camorra]], a powerful [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[mafia]]-like organization. In this book Saviano employs [[prose]] and news-reporting style to narrate the story of the Camorra, exposing its territory and business connections.

Since 2006, following the publication of the book, Saviano has been threatened by several Neapolitan “[[Capo di tutti capi|godfathers]]”. The Italian Minister of the Interior has granted him a permanent [[police escort]], but he's been often attacked by politicians of [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s cabinet. Also, his escort has been questioned.

As of December 2008, the book has sold almost 4 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174278 |title=Streets of ‘Gomorrah’|work= Newsweek|date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book comes from a text by [[Giuseppe Diana]], a parish priest in Casal di Principe who was killed by the Camorra in March 1994: "time has come to stop being a Gomorrah."&lt;ref name=varese&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a913746680&amp;fulltext=713240928 |title=The Camorra closely observed], by Federico Varese|journal=Global Crime|volume= 10|issue= 3 |date=August 2009 |pages= 262 – 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception ==
''Gomorrah'' won numerous literary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Viareggio-Repaci Prize for best [[debut novel]], Premio Giancarlo Siani, Premio Dedalus, Premio "Lo Straniero", Premio Letterario Edoardo Kihlgren for best debut novel, Premio Tropea, the Vittorini Prize for civic engagement and the Guido Dorso literary prize&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 the number of copies sold in Italy surpassed 2,000,000.

''Gomorrah'' has been translated in 51 countries. It appeared in the best sellers’ lists of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Sweden and Finland. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has placed it amongst the most important books of 2007, while ''[[The Economist]]'' has included it among the hundred books of the year. Saviano is the only Italian to be placed in both lists.

''Gomorrah'' was described by some critics and other Italian authors (such as [[Wu Ming]], [[Carlo Lucarelli]] and [[Valerio Evangelisti]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/outtakes/NIE_have_to_be_the_parents.htm A Reflection on ''Gomorrah'' in the context of the New Italian Epic ], opening talk at the conference "The Italian Perspective on metahistorical fiction: The New Italian Epic", IGRS, University of London, October 2nd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html a single webpage regrouping two articles by major Italian authors published on two important daily newspapers: Carlo Lucarelli, "Noi scrittori della nuova epica", ''La Repubblica'', May 3rd, 2008 and Valerio Evangelisti, "Literary Opera", ''L'Unità'', May 6th, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065856/http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html |date=2009-03-16 }}. 
Lucarelli wrote: "I agree with enthusiasm and great interest to Wu Ming's reflections on the New Italian Epic, and I practically identify myself with many of their observations. By "practically" I mean in terms of a literary praxis, a research done by means of books and novels [...] by means of history, which for us Italians has never become past and is always present and contemporary [...], also by means of telling the hidden everyday life of the camorra, as Saviano did...'"

According to Evangelisti, "''Gomorrah'', which is far from being a mere journalistic report, makes a statement which [[Jean-Patrick Manchette]] would have appreciated: crime is not a secondary element of capitalism, a perversion of its principles. On the contrary, crime is at the core of capitalism, it's one of the main pillars of the system [...] This unidentified object – is it a report or a novel? – has a choral nature that links it to epic, in this case an epic that has no heroes but is capable to embrace a whole world."&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a turbulent, heterogeneous stream in Italian writing called the [[New Italian Epic]], whose representatives are particularly keen on producing not only novels and non-fiction narratives, but also real UNOs, Unidentified Narrative Objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/suoni/audiotheque.htm#allegorithms Italian novelist Wu Ming  explains the concept of New Italian Epic] in a conference at Middlebury College, VT, March 31st, 2008 - audio, English, 50:00&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gomorrah'' itself was described as a UNO by several critics, readers and  writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/Giap/gomorra.htm "Appunti sul come e il cosa di Gomorra], on wumingfoundation.com, June 2006 (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical, cinematic and television adaptations==
''Gomorrah''  has been made into a play written by Saviano with Mario Gelardi and [[Gomorrah (film)|a 2008 film]] directed by [[Matteo Garrone]] and produced by Fandango. On September 24, 2008, the film was picked by ANICA (Italy's Association of the Cinematic and Audiovisual Industry) to represent Italy in the race for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] Oscar nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic06d5fa4f707358585ba55a4294ccd82 Eric J. Lyman, "''Gomorrah'' in Oscar's foreign-language gang: Italian organized crime drama joins list of contenders"], Hollywood Reporter, September 24th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Garrone's film adaptation of the book, Christoph Huber wrote: "With its interest in moving beyond the categories of novel or non-fiction, Saviano's work has been identified as part of a heterogeneous strain of national literature, subsumed as the New Italian Epic. A term that certainly isn't disgraced by ''Gomorrah'', the film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html Christop Huber, "Gomorrah", Cinemascope #35] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514052128/http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html |date=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the book was also loosely adapted as an [[Gomorrah (TV series)|eponymous television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rees |first=Jasper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11011682/Gomorrah-Sky-Atlantic-review-ugly-in-a-good-way.html |title=Gomorra, Sky Atlantic, review: 'ugly, in a good way' |work=Telegraph |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">The '''Health Impact Fund''' ('''HIF''') is a proposed pay-for-performance mechanism that would provide a market-based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally. It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global [[disease burden|burden of disease]]. The HIF is the creation of a team of researchers led by the [[Yale]] philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] and the [[University of Calgary]] economist [[Aidan Hollis]], and is promoted by the non-profit organization [[Incentives for Global Health]] (IGH).

==Motivation==
In the current system of development and distribution of medicines, millions of people in poor countries die from diseases because the patented medicines they need are unaffordable or because no medicine exists to cure their ailments.  Little pharmaceutical research is concentrated on [[diseases of poverty|diseases specific to the poor.]] This is largely because it has been difficult for pharmaceutical companies to profit from [[drug development|research and development]] directed at products needed by the poor. The cost of pharmaceutical research and development is high and unlikely to be recovered from those in poor countries who cannot afford the medicines. Therefore, "the Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor." &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, T. Pogge. 2011. “Revitalizing Pharmaceutical Innovation for Global Health,” Health Affairs 30(2):367. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pharmaceutical research and development is partly a result of the global patent regime established by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).  Prior to TRIPS, countries were free to not enact intellectual property laws covering medicines, leading to flourishing generic drug industries in countries such as [[India]]. Following TRIPS, all [[World Trade Organization]] members were required to institute strict, American-style intellectual property rights. As a result, the supply of generic medicines to poor countries has been sharply diminished.&lt;ref name="stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1279 Scrooge and Intellectual Property Rights]," ''British Medical Journal'' 333, no. 7582 (2006), pp. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]], the pharmaceutical patent system needs an "alternative" that would "give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions."&lt;ref name="stiglitz" /&gt;

==Design of the Fund==
The HIF is intended to address the problems with an uncomplemented pharmaceutical patent system.  The HIF uses market forces to create incentives to develop medicines for typically neglected diseases and to distribute these medicines at low prices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical patent-holders would receive financial rewards by opting to register their new medicines, or new uses of existing medicines, with the Fund. By registering, a patent-holder agrees to distribute its medicine globally at [[cost]] and to cooperate in measuring the health impact of that medicine. In return, the firm receives an annual reward based on its measurable contribution to reducing the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Registrants of new drugs are eligible for reward payments for ten years starting at the date of [[Approved drug|marketing approval]] of their product. New uses receive rewards for five years. Following the reward period, registrants agree to allow [[generic drug|generic]] manufacturing of their medicines, in order to prevent price spikes.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Registrants retain their rights to control follow-on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the health impact of a registered product==
When assessing the health impact of a registered product, “the HIF would essentially estimate the difference between (1) the actual health status of people who consumed the registered product and (2) the estimated health status of those people, had they not had access to the registered product.”&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard measure of health impact is the [[Quality-Adjusted Life Year]] (QALY). For example, if all registered products were in conjunction estimated to have saved 10 million QALYs, then a registered product that saved 1 million of those QALYS would receive ten percent of the available reward funds for that year.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The health impact assessment of a registered product would be conducted for each year of its registration with the HIF, and payments would be disbursed annually.

==Funding==
The HIF is to be financed by governments. Ideally, countries will commit a fixed amount of their [[gross national income]] (GNI) to the HIF (0.03 percent of a country’s GNI is the suggested minimum).&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Next step: an innovative pilot==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
As performance measurement is a core component of the HIF, it needs to be robust across different products and in diverse settings. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IGH will perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. The HIF would expand assessment beyond pre-approval clinical trials, using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical trials, physician surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed HIF mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for-performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale.

Outcomes and Benefits of the Pilot:
(1.)	Create a comprehensive metric to evaluate the health impact of medicines based on the actual reductions in mortality and morbidity each achieves.
(2.)	Determine how to apply this metric reliably through a field-test that focuses on a new drug’s introduction into a specific area. No attempt has ever been made to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine.
(3.)	Benefit people in the field-test area by giving them access to an important new product at an affordable price and by rewarding the innovator promoting its wide and effective use by those who can benefit from it.

IGH is currently{{when|date=March 2014}} exploring opportunities for potential pilots.

==Relationship to other proposals==
The HIF can be seen as a kind of comprehensive [[advance market commitments|Advanced Market Commitment]], since it essentially is a way of incentivizing new research while ensuring access at low prices. However, compared to the Advanced Market Commitment, it is comprehensive because it could apply to any drug or vaccine, and it would operate in all countries. Alternatively, one can put it in the context of prizes, since it has prize-like characteristics in terms of incentivizing research while not enabling high prices. A third way of viewing it is as a supplementary global [[health insurance|drug insurance system]],  in which the [[copayment]] made by consumers is equal to the cost of production.

The HIF staff has prepared a memo setting out their view of the intellectual history of the HIF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/origins.doc HIF intellectual history memo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

=== Criticisms ===

When the HIF was proposed in 2008, it attracted criticism from Professor Brook Baker and Knowledge Ecology International for not requiring open licensing of registered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgap.org/trips/bakeronHIF.htm Baker criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keionline.org/hif Knowledge Ecology International criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it allowed drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly, subject to regulated prices. The proponents modified the proposal in response, suggesting greater flexibility about this aspect of the HIF,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/HIF_supplementsNov09.pdf Modified proposal in response to Baker and KEI criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; but this remains a controversial feature of the proposal, when compared to other prize fund proposals that feature open licensing of patents to generic manufacturers.

Brita Pekarsky (2010) has argued that the cost of the HIF may be too high, if it is taking money away from other valuable development aid or health related activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brita Pekarsky, “Should Financial Incentives be Used to Differentially Reward ‘Me-Too’ and Innovative Drugs,” ''Pharmacoeconomics''  28.1(2010): 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Grootendorst (2009) states that the primary drawback of the HIF is the difficulty of measuring health impact accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grootendorst, “How Should We Support Pharmaceutical Innovation?,” ''Expert. Rev. Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Res.'' 2009: 9(4) – 313-320.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes particularly the problems of trying to attribute health impact to drugs that have long latency periods in their effectiveness (such as vaccines and anti-hypertensives); the problems of consistency across different therapeutic areas; and the technical difficulty of disentangling the effect of the drug from confounding factors.

Jorn Sonderholm (2009) argues that there is a lack of evidence that patents create a barrier to access, so that the HIF may fail to address a real problem.&lt;ref&gt;Jorn Sonderholm, “A Reform Proposal in Need of Reform: A Critique of Thomas Pogge’s Proposal for How to Incentivize Research and Development of Essential Drugs,” ''Public Health Ethics'' 0.0 (2009): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana (2011) criticized the HIF on a variety of grounds, including its approach to the distribution of benefits and costs, the impact on generic competition and the role of the HIF in strategic negotiations on intellectual property rights,&lt;ref&gt;Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana, "Health Impact Fund – Raising Issues Of Distribution, IP Rights And Alliances," ''IP-Watch.Org'', September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a response from IGH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2011/10/03/a-response-from-the-authors-of-the-health-impact-fund/ Response to criticism by Fukuda-Parr and Ariana]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afschin Gandjour and Nadja Chernyak state that the HIF does not have a rational basis for the underlying willingness to pay per health gain and, instead, uses an arbitrary figure such as 0.03% of the GNI. Furthermore, the HIF assumes an arbitrary duration of reward (e.g., 10 years) and does not adjust health gains for equity concerns and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandjour|first1=Afschin|last2=Chernyak|first2=Nadja|title=A new prize system for drug innovation|journal=Health Policy|date=October 2011|volume=102|issue=2-3|pages=170–177|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Social Democratic Party of Germany officially endorsed the HIF and called on the German government to actively support a HIF pilot.&lt;ref&gt;German Social Democratic Party, "[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/021/1702135.pdf Germany's responsibility to fight for health in developing countries - neglected diseases, reduce child and maternal mortality and a strong Global Fund]," Drucksache 17/2135, June 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing (related to Public health, innovation and intellectual property) described the HIF as one of a few "promising" proposals deserving further examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/who-hif.html "WHO Working Group Endorses HIF"], Incentives for Global Health. 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   A new WHO Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) has noted that the HIF proposal would benefit from a pilot to demonstrate feasibility.

Carl Nathan (2009) suggests that the HIF could help to overcome obstacles to the control of tuberculosis such as development and distribution of vaccines and medicines to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Nathan, “Taming Tuberculosis: A Challenge for Science and Society,” ''Cell Host and Microbe'' 5(2009): 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

John J. DeGioia, President of Georgetown University, has complimented the HIF for bringing moral imperatives and pragmatic market principles together.  He states, "that this is the beauty of the Health Impact Fund . . . it translates idealism into innovation."&lt;ref&gt;John J. DeGioia, [http://president.georgetown.edu/sections/speeches/61659.html  “Making New Medicines Available to All: The Health Impact Fund,”] Georgetown University, Gonda Theater.  1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Barry and Matt Peterson favour the HIF as a mechanism for providing innovators with incentives to develop new medicines that have significant health impacts rather than significant sales impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Barry and Matt Peterson, “Shallow Cuts: GSK’s Voluntary Price Reductions and Patent Pooling Are Not Enough,” ''Public Ethics Media'', 4 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Orbinski states that the HIF is an innovative policy proposal that "should be implemented."&lt;ref&gt;James Orbinski, “Are Patents Impeding Medical Care and Innovation?”, [http://www.plosmedicine.org/home.action ''PLoS Medicine''] 7.1(2009): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Icelandic Art Center''''' (''[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: Kynningarmiðstöð íslenskrar myndlistar;'' IAC) is the platform for [[Iceland]]ic [[visual art]] activities. IAC promotes Icelandic art by connecting the local visual art community with the international art network. IAC enforces national and international collaborations in order to improve opportunities for Icelandic artists in their home country and to increase their visibility abroad.

The Icelandic Art Center was founded in 2005 and is located at [[Lækjargata]] 3 in [[Reykjavík]]. 

Its main objectives are to provide an information center; promote Icelandic art and mediation to international art events; commission the Icelandic Pavilion at [[Venice Biennale]]; initiate exhibitions and conference; and have a visitor program. In 2007, Frida Bjørk Ingvarsdóttir was the chairwoman of the IAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/diary/andrew-berardini-on-jens-hoffmann-and-olafur-eliasson-in-san-francisco-15796|title=Luxury Imports|website=www.artforum.com|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">In [[mathematics]], the  '''Jucys&amp;ndash;Murphy elements''' in the [[group algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; of the [[symmetric group]], named after [[Algimantas Adolfas Jucys]] and G. E. Murphy, are defined as a sum of [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;X_1=0, ~~~  X_k= (1 k)+ (2 k)+\cdots+(k-1\ k), ~~~ k=2,\dots,n. &lt;/math&gt;

They play an important role in the [[representation theory]] of the [[symmetric group]].

==Properties==
They generate a commutative subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [ S_n] &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover,
''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; commutes with all elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_{n-1}] &lt;/math&gt;.

The vectors constituting   the basis of Young's "seminormal representation"   are eigenvectors for the action of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For any [[standard Young tableau]] ''U'' we have:

:&lt;math&gt;X_k v_U =c_k(U) v_U, ~~~ k=1,\dots,n, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'') is the ''content'' ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' of the cell (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') occupied by  ''k'' in the standard Young tableau&amp;nbsp;''U''.

'''Theorem''' (Jucys): The [[Center (algebra)|center]] &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbb{C} [S_n])&lt;/math&gt; of the group algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt;  of the symmetric group is generated by the [[symmetric polynomial]]s in the elements ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''Theorem''' (Jucys): Let ''t'' be a formal variable commuting with everything, then the following identity for polynomials in variable ''t'' with values in the group algebra  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; holds true:

:&lt;math&gt; (t+X_1) (t+X_2) \cdots (t+X_n)= \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sigma t^{\text{number of cycles of }\sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ([[Okounkov]]&amp;ndash;[[Vershik]]): The subalgebra of  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [S_n] &lt;/math&gt; generated by the centers

: &lt;math&gt; Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_1]), Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_2]), \ldots,  Z(\mathbb{C} [ S_{n-1}]),  Z(\mathbb{C} [S_n])  &lt;/math&gt;

is exactly the subalgebra generated by the Jucys&amp;ndash;Murphy elements ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

[[File:G(012).JPG|thumb|First page of the [[Codex Boernerianus]] with lacuna in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:1-4]]
A '''lacuna'''{{refn|group=Note|From [[Latin]] ''lacūna'' ("ditch, gap"), literally "little ''lacus''" ("lake, basin").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|lacuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|lacuna}}, {{L&amp;S|lacus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}&amp;nbsp;'''lacunae''' or '''lacunas''') is a gap in a [[manuscript]], [[inscription]], text, painting, or a musical work. A manuscript, text, or section suffering from gaps is said to be "lacunose" or "lacunulose". Some books intentionally add lacunas to be filled in by the owner (e.g., "The _____ played with the _____ in the _____."), often as a game or to encourage children to create their own stories.

Weathering, decay, and other damage to old manuscripts or inscriptions are often responsible for lacunae&amp;mdash;words, sentences, or whole passages that are missing or illegible. [[Palimpsests]] are particularly vulnerable. To reconstruct the original text, the context must be considered. In [[papyrology]] and [[textual criticism]] this may lead to competing reconstructions and interpretations. Published texts that contain lacunae often mark the section where text is missing with a bracketed ellipsis. For example, "This sentence contains 20 words, and [...] nouns," or, "Finally, the army arrived at [...] and made camp."

==Famous examples==
* A famous [[Old English]] example of a lacuna is in the manuscript [[British Library MS Cotton Vitellius A. xv]], the poem [[Beowulf]]:
::hyrde ich thæt [... ...On]elan cwen. '''(Fitt 1, line 62)'''
:This particular lacuna is always reproduced in editions of the text, but many people have attempted to fill it, notably editors Wyatt-Chambers and Dobbie, among others, who accept the verb "waes" (''was''). Malone (1929) proposed the name [[Yrse]] for the unnamed queen, as that would alliterate with [[Onela]]. This is still hotly debated amongst editors, however.&lt;ref&gt;G.

* Another notable lacuna is the eight-leaves-long [[Great Lacuna]] in the ''[[Codex Regius]]'', the most prominent source for [[Norse mythology]] and early Germanic heroic legends. Parts of it survived in independent manuscripts and in prose form in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.
* In [[Minuscule 69|Codex Leicester]] the text skips from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:45 to 14:17 without a break; possibly a scribe rewrote it from a defective manuscript.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Little House on the Prairie'' books}}
The original '''Little House books''' were a series of eight autobiographical children's novels written by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] and published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] from 1932 to 1943. The eighth book, ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'', featured Laura Ingalls at ages 15 to 18 and was originally published with one page at the end containing the note, "The end of the Little House books."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/43051065] {{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth and last novel written by Wilder, ''The First Four Years'' was published posthumously and unfinished in 1971. Although her intentions are unknown&lt;!--we say in the book article--&gt;, it is commonly considered part of the [[Little House series]] and is included in the 9-volume paperback box set ''Little House, Big Adventure'' (Harper Trophy, May 1994).&lt;ref name=9set1994/&gt;

Several book series and some single novels by other writers have been published for children, young adults and adult readers. They provide fictionalized accounts of the lives of Wilder's great-grandmother [[Martha Morse Tucker]], grandmother [[Charlotte Tucker Quiner]], mother [[Caroline Ingalls]], and daughter [[Rose Wilder Lane]]'s childhood and teenage years, as well as Wilder's own missing years—those portions of her life not featured in her novels, including most of her adult life. One story not written by Wilder is ''[[Old Town in the Green Groves]]'' by [[Cynthia Rylant]]. It tells the story of the "lost little house" years.

In addition, simplified versions of the original series have been published for younger children in chapter and picture book form.

Some nonfiction books by Ingalls Wilder, and some by other writers, are sometimes called Little House books or Little House on the Prairie books.

The eight ''Little House'' books published during the author's lifetime are [[public domain]] in countries where the [[List of countries' copyright lengths|term of copyright]] lasts 50 years or less after the death of the author.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==''Little House in the Big Woods''==
{{main|Little House in the Big Woods}}
[[Image:1932-LittleHouseInTheBigWoods.jpg|thumb|left |150px| Front cover of the first edition, 1932 (distributed with a dustjacket)]]
[[File:Little House Wayside replica.jpg|thumb|left|Little House replica at the [[Little House Wayside]], 2007 ]]
The story of the first book in the series, ''Little House in the Big Woods'', revolves around the life of the Ingalls family in their small home near [[Pepin, Wisconsin]]. The family includes mother Caroline Lake Quiner Ingalls, father Charles Phillip Ingalls, eldest daughter [[Mary Ingalls|Mary Amelia Ingalls]], middle daughter (and protagonist) Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder, and youngest sister Carrie.&lt;ref&gt;en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Ingalls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: Young Pioneer'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Laura turns five years old during the book, the author was actually only three years old during the real-life events documented in the novel.  According to a letter from Wilder's daughter, Rose, to biographer William Anderson, the publisher had Laura change her age in the book because it seemed unrealistic for a three-year-old to have such specific memories.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: The Iowa  Story'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the sake of continuity, in Wilder's later book, ''Little House on the Prairie'', Laura portrayed herself as between six and seven years of age.

''Little House in the Big Woods'' describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the family goes to Grandma Ingalls’s and has a “sugaring off”. The family and neighbors harvest sap and make [[maple syrup]]. The Ingalls family returns home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off, and the dance that followed, for the rest of her life.

The book also describes other farm work duties and events, such as the birth of a calf, and the availability of [[milk]], [[butter]] and [[cheese]], gardening, field work, and hunting and gathering. Everyday housework is described in detail. When Pa goes into the woods to hunt, he usually comes home with a deer and smokes the meat for the coming winter. One day he notices a bee tree and returns from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the [[honey]]. When Pa returns in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary beg him to play his [[fiddle]], as he is too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.

== ''Farmer Boy'' ==
{{main|Farmer Boy}}
''Farmer Boy'', published in 1933, is the second of the Little House series.  It is the sole book that does not focus on the childhood of Laura Ingalls.  It is focused on the childhood of Laura's future husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]], growing up on a farm in upstate New York in the 1860s.  It takes place before Laura was born.

The book begins just before Wilder's ninth birthday and follows at least two harvest cycles. Set around 1866, it describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm and Almanzo's part in it.  The novel includes stories of Almanzo's brother Royal and his sisters Eliza Jane and Alice. 

Notably, the ages of the Wilder children do not appear to be accurate to their real ages in comparison to Almanzo. Royal is stated to be thirteen, and Eliza Jane and Alice twelve and ten respectively, at the time when Almanzo is just prior to nine years old. In reality, when Almanzo turned nine, Royal would have been nineteen, old enough to leave home, and Eliza Jane and Alice would have been sixteen and twelve years old. This makes it likely that parts of the storyline based around the three older children was fabricated, at least in terms of what Almanzo himself could remember.

Almanzo had a third sister, Laura (1844–1899), who at the time and events in the novel was already about twenty-two and had presumably moved out. He later had a brother, Perley (1869–1934), who was not yet born at the time ''Farmer Boy'' is set.

==''Little House on the Prairie''==
{{main|Little House on the Prairie (novel)}}
''Little House on the Prairie'', published in 1935, is the third of the series of books known as the Little House series, but only the second book to focus on the life of the Ingalls family. The book takes place from 1873–1874.

The book tells about the months the Ingalls family spent on the prairie of Kansas, around the town of [[Independence, Kansas]]. At the beginning of this story, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa Ingalls]] decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of [[Wisconsin]], and move the family, via [[covered wagon]] to the [[Indian Territory]] near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (technically still under [[Osage Nation|Osage]] ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders. Laura, along with Pa and [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]], [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], and baby [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]], moves to [[Kansas]]. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]], which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.

[[Image:Caroline&amp;CharlesIngalls.jpg|thumb|right| Caroline and Charles Ingalls]]

When the family reaches Indian Territory, they meet Mr. Edwards, who is extremely polite to Ma, but tells Laura and Mary that he is "a wildcat from [[Tennessee]]." Mr. Edwards is an excellent neighbor, and helps the Ingalls family in every way he can, beginning with helping Pa build their house. Pa builds a roof and a floor for the house and digs a well with assistance from another neighour, Mr. Scott, and the family is finally settled.

Unlike during their time in the Big Woods, the family meets difficulty and danger on the prairie. The Ingalls become terribly ill with "[[malaria|fever 'n' ague]]" (fever with severe chills and shaking) which was later identified as [[malaria]]. Laura comments on the varied ways they believe to have acquired it, with "Ma" asserting that it came from eating bad watermelon. Dr.Tan, an African American doctor, takes care of the family while they are sick. Around this time,  Mr. Edwards brings Laura and Mary their Christmas presents from Independence, and in the spring, the Ingallses plant the beginnings of a small farm.

Ma's prejudice against American Indians, and Laura's childish feelings, are shown side by side with the portrayal of the Osage tribe that lives on and owns the Ingalls's land. A recurring feature of the book is Laura's desire to see a Native American baby, referred to as a [[papoose]] by the family, culminating with Laura demanding that Pa kidnap a baby from the Osage tribe as they leave, shocking both Ma and Pa and encouraging an emotional reality hit for Laura. At the end of this book, the family is told that the land must be vacated by settlers as it is not legally open to settlement yet, and in 1874 Pa elects to leave the land and move before the Army forcibly requires him to abandon the land.

Many of the incidents in the book are actual situations that happened to the Ingalls family. In fact the actual years the events took place were in 1869 to 1870, So Laura was actually two to three years old while the Ingalls lived in Indian Territory during 1869–1870, and she did not remember the incidents herself, she did more historical research on this novel than on any other novel she wrote in an attempt to have all details as accurate as possible.

==''On the Banks of Plum Creek''==
{{main|On the Banks of Plum Creek}}
The fourth book in the series, ''On the Banks of Plum Creek'', takes place from 1871 to 1874, and follows the Ingalls family as they move from Kansas to an area near [[Walnut Grove, Minnesota]], and settle in a dugout "on the banks of [[Plum Creek (Redwood County, Minnesota)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html |title=The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum |publisher=Hoover.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025222424/http://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html |archive-date=2014-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jack, the family bulldog, moves with the family to Plum Creek, though in real life he did not make the journey. Laura's age is still not accurately portrayed in relation to actual events. During the course of the story, Laura is between the ages of seven and nine years old, but in 1871 her real age would have been four or five.

Pa trades his horses Pet and Patty to the property owner (a man named Hanson) for the land and crops, but later gets two new horses as Christmas presents for the family, which Laura and her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]] name "Sam" and "David". Pa soon builds an above-ground, wooden house for the family. Laura and Mary go to school for the first time at Barry Corner School, where they meet their teacher, Miss Eva Beadle, and befriend Christy and Cassie Kennedy. They also meet [[Nellie Oleson]], who makes fun of Laura and Mary for being "country girls." They begin attending the town church on Sundays, with services given by the widely-loved Reverend Alden, and Laura and Mary go to Sunday School with their new friends. Laura plays with her bulldog Jack when she is home, and she and Mary are invited to a party at the Olesons' home. Laura and Mary invite all the girls (including Nellie) to a party at their house to reciprocate. The family soon goes through hard times when a plague of [[Rocky Mountain Locust]], or grasshoppers, devastates their crops.  For the family to survive, Pa has to go east alone to get a job to make money to get them through the year.  The whole family is very excited when he returns from this job.  The book ends with Pa returning safely to the house after being unaccounted for during a severe four-day [[blizzard]].

==''By the Shores of Silver Lake''==
{{main|By the Shores of Silver Lake}}
The fifth book in the series, ''By the Shores of Silver Lake'' is based on Laura's late childhood spent near [[De Smet, South Dakota]], beginning in 1879. The book also introduces Laura's youngest sister [[Grace Ingalls|Grace]].

The story begins when the family is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has recovered from the [[Scarlet fever|scarlet fever]] which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry’s railroad camp. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa to look for a homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so the rest of the family follows later by train.

The day Pa leaves, however, their beloved bulldog Jack is found dead, which saddens Laura greatly. In actuality, the dog upon whom Jack was based was no longer with the family at this point, but the author inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence. Laura also begins to play a more mature role in the family due to Mary's blindness—Pa instructs Laura to "be Mary's eyes" and to assist her in daily life as she learns to cope with her disability. Mary is strong and willing to learn.

The family travels to Dakota Territory by train—this is the children's first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this new mode of transportation that allows them to travel in one hour the distance it would take a horse and wagon an entire day to cover. When the family reunites at the railroad camp, Laura meets her cousin Lena and the two become good friends.

As winter approaches and the railroad workers head back East, the Ingallses wonder where they might stay for the winter. As luck would have it, the county surveyor needs a house-sitter while he is East for the winter, and Pa signs up. It is a winter of luxury for the Ingalls family as they are given all the provisions they need in the large, comfortable house. They spend a cozy winter with their new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Boast, and both families look forward to starting their new claims in the spring.

The "Spring Rush" comes early. The large mobilization of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' trip to the claims office. The girls are left alone and spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa, which Mary begins to attend later in the series.

With the aid of his old friend Mr. Edwards, Pa successfully files his claim. As the spring flowers bloom and the prairie comes alive with new settlers, the Ingalls family moves to their new piece of land and begins building what will become their permanent home.

==''The Long Winter''==
{{main|The Long Winter (novel)}}
The sixth book in the series take place mostly over the winter of 1880–1881, one of the most notably severe winters in history, also known as "The Snow Winter".&lt;ref&gt;Laskin, David.

[http://files.usgwarchives.net/sd/history/robinson/liii.txt Chapter III]. pp. 306-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]] begins in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls homestead on a hot August day in 1880. Laura's father, Pa, is haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going to be hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.

Laura attends school with her younger sister, Carrie, until the weather becomes too severe to permit them to walk to and from the school building. Blizzard after blizzard sweeps through the town over the next few months. The frequent blizzards prevent supply trains from getting to De Smet and food and fuel become scarce and expensive. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the trains, leaving the town stranded. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.

As predicted, the blizzards continue for seven months. Finally, the trains begin running again, bringing the Ingalls a Christmas barrel full of good things – including a turkey. In the last chapter, they sit down to enjoy their Christmas dinner in May.

The book is notable as being the first in which Laura's age is historically accurate (in 1880 she would have been 13, as she states in the first chapter). However, Almanzo Wilder's age is misrepresented.  Much is made of the fact that he is 19 pretending to be 21 in order to obtain a homestead claim from the US government. In reality, WIlder was ten years older than Laura. In 1880, his true age would have been 23.  Scholar Ann Romines has suggested that Laura made Almanzo younger because it was felt that more modern audiences would be scandalized by the great difference in their ages in light of their young marriage.

==''Little Town on the Prairie''==
{{main|Little Town on the Prairie}}
The seventh book begins in 1881, just after the long winter, and is largely set in the town of De Smet, South Dakota.

The story begins as Laura accepts her first job performing sewing work in order to earn money for Mary to go to a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura's hard work comes to an end when she is let go, and the family begins planning to raise cash crops to pay for Mary's college. After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. While Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home and are truly surprised.

In the fall, the Ingalls prepare for a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power. She also meets a new girl, Ida Brown, who has been adopted by the town's minister and his wife. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo’s sister. [[Nellie Oleson]], Laura's nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is attending the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. This is because to begin with, Miss Wilder is not very strict and wants to be friends with all the children.  Therefore, the children realize that they can get away with acting up most of the time. When Miss Wilder realizes she no longer has control, she begins to use steadily crueler and unneeded punishments, including humiliating Carrie in front of the entire school and striking her hands. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term, and is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and then Mr. Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.

Throughout this book, Laura's struggles with order and commitment are highlighted; her grades in school are no longer perfect, and she finds less pleasure in her unchanging life, growing restless and agitated. She focuses her goals on keeping Mary in college, but seems unsure about what she wants for herself. This comes to a head when she throws down her schoolbooks in a tantrum, declaring that she wants something to change and she is tired of having to act like an adult. Later that night, Pa reveals that the elders of the town are founding a literary society; far from what the name suggests, it is a weekly source of entertainment for the townsfolk, ranging from spelling competitions to a [[minstrel show]]. The literary meetings become Laura's primary reason for endurance, and with something to look forward to she is happy to study again.  

At around the same time as the literary meeitngs, Almanzo Wilder begins escorting Laura home from church. By Christmastime, Almanzo once again sees Laura home, and offers to take her on a sleigh ride after he completes the cutter he is building.

At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who interview Laura for a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from town. The school superintendent comes and tests Laura (though she is two months too young, he never asks her age), and she is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.

==''These Happy Golden Years''==
{{main|These Happy Golden Years}}
The eighth book in the series, ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' takes place between 1882 and 1885. As the story begins, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa]] is taking Laura 12 miles from home to her first teaching assignment at Brewster settlement. Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught. She is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa.

This first teaching job proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It is a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, some of whom are older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through her time there, and successfully completes the two-month assignment, with all five of her pupils sorry to see her go.

To Laura's surprise and delight, homesteader [[Almanzo Wilder]] (with whom she became acquainted in ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'') appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and back to school each weekend.

The relationship continues after the school term ends. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses, Barnum and Skip. Laura's old nemesis, [[Nellie Oleson]], makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoy Laura. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead.

Laura's Uncle Tom (Ma's brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills. Laura helps out seamstress Mrs. McKee by staying with her and her daughter, Mattie, on their prairie claim for two months to "hold it down" as required by law. The family enjoys summer visits from Mary.

The Ingalls family finances have improved to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]]. Laura continues to teach and work as a seamstress, and Almanzo invites Laura to attend a new "singing school" with him and her classmates. On the last evening of singing school, while driving Laura home, Almanzo – who has by now been courting Laura for three years – proposes to Laura. During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a garnet-and-pearl ring and they share their first kiss.

Several months later, after Almanzo has finished building a house on his tree claim, he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days as his sister and mother have their hearts set on a large church wedding, which Pa cannot afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married in a simple ceremony by the Reverend Brown. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.

==''The First Four Years''==
{{main|The First Four Years (novel)}}
The ninth book in the series, ''[[The First Four Years (novel)]]'', and the final book to feature Laura as the protagonist, follows the earliest years of Laura and Almanzo's marriage. Found after Wilder's death, the book was published in its original draft form in 1971.

The First Four Years derives its title from a promise Laura made to Almanzo when they became engaged. Laura did not want to be a farm wife, but she consented to try farming for three years. At the end of that time, Laura and Almanzo mutually agreed to continue for one more year, a "year of grace". Over the course of the novel, which is set near [[De Smet, South Dakota]], Laura and Almanzo's daughter, [[Rose Wilder Lane|Rose]], is born, they lose their unnamed son shortly after his birth, suffer a bout of [[diphtheria]] that leaves Almanzo in poor health for the rest of his life, and lose their house in a fire. The book ends at the close of that fourth year, on a rather optimistic note. In reality, a two-year drought and several other tragic events eventually drove the Wilders into debt and from their land. They later founded a successful fruit and dairy farm in Mansfield, Missouri, where they lived comfortably until their respective deaths.

''Little House: The Laura Years'' is also the title of one 5-volume boxed set published in 1994, which comprises volumes 1 and 3–6.&lt;ref name=5set1994&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Little-House-Laura-Years-Boxed/dp/0064404765#reader_0064404765 |title=Little House the Laura Years Boxed Set: The Early Years Collection: Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams: 9780064404761: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it features the Ingalls family until Laura is 14 years old. The second-published Little House book, ''Farmer Boy'' features [[Almanzo Wilder]] at ages 8 to 10 in upstate New York. None of the Ingalls family appears in it, and Almanzo Wilder does not otherwise appear in the series until late in the sixth book, so "The Laura Years" has some merit as title or subtitle of this 5-volume selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">'''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tones, [[tints and shades]] ) of a single [[hue]]. [[File:CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg|frame|Example of a monochromatic color scheme]]
Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, grey or black.

Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility.

The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color. The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Z.|title=Colour Combination Techniques|date=2014|publisher=Design Research Associates|location=Sydney AUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in comparison to polychromatic). That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of monochromatic|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monochromatic|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, monochromatic also has another meaning similar to “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word.

== Recommends for CUD  ==
It is also be recommended to use monochromatic color for [[Color Universal Design]] (CUD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Web |url=http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/ |title=Color Universal Design (CUD) - How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people - |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image with enough [[contrast ratio]] monochromatic color also compatible with [[color blindness]] people.

The '''Museo Archeologico Ostiense''' (or ''Archaeological Museum of Ostia'') is an [[archaeological museum]] dedicated to the ancient Roman city of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. 

The museum was built by [[Pope Pius IX]], who in 1865 had to readapt a fifteenth-century building used as a store to create a city museum. Contained in the museum are numerous archaeological objects which came to light during a long period of excavations. The collection includes, for example, a collection of portraits of famous people from ancient Ostia, including [[philosopher]]s and members of the royal family, such as busts depicting [[Asclepius]] and  Volcacius Myropnous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/valkvisuals/html/tombe_07.htm|title=tombe 7|work=ostia-antica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portrait of [[Faustina the Elder]] and the head of [[Trajan]]. The museum also has a large collection of sculptures, including the statue of [[Perseus]] holding the head of [[Medusa]], the sculptural group of [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]] slaying the bull, and other works. There are other examples on display of great interest, such as small groups in marble depicting [[Cupid and Psyche]] and other subjects, and in another section of the museum, [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[relief]]s. On display are also examples of wall paintings from different burials and emblems of [[polychrome]] [[mosaic]]s, such as the [[Christ Blessing (Raphael)|Christ Blessing]]. These works of great historical and artistic value, are then supported by a collection of minor works such as crafts, glass, and even teaches some at the shop, and some interesting facts, such as the marble slab found in the temple of the goddess of war, [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], on which are carved two pairs of feet opposite, probably a [[Votive offering|votive]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp Museo Archeologico Ostiense di Roma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207024020/http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp |date=2013-12-07 }}, Retrieved 18 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">A '''not-for-profit arts organization''' usually takes the form of a [[not-for-profit corporation]], [[Voluntary association|association]], or [[foundation (charity)|foundation]]. Such organizations are formed for the purpose of developing and promoting the work of [[artist]]s in various [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing arts|performing art]] forms such as [[film]], [[sculpture]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[multimedia]], [[poetry]], and [[performance art]].

==History==
Although [[museum]]s and performing arts societies have existed for centuries, they have proliferated since the end of World War II. In particular, government sponsored organisations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the [[Canada Council]], the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], have been created to fund award grants to help promote the development of art and culture.

There are also not-for-profit legal service organizations providing services to artists and arts and cultural organizations. [[Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts|Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts]] (PVLA) is one such organization. Through its volunteer attorneys PVLA provides non-criminal legal assistance to artists and arts and cultural organizations on arts related issues.

==Canadian artist-run centres==
In [[Canada]], a series of artist-run organizations often known as "parallel galleries" or artist-run centres (ARCs) have developed in cities across the country since the 1960s to encourage the exhibition of contemporary works by Canadian and international artists. The purpose is often to provide alternative spaces for exhibition for emerging artists and contemporary artists outside the commercial gallery system. Canadian ARCs usually pay a fee and de-emphasize the selling of work, although this will vary from gallery to gallery. A recommended schedule of payment is provided by the [[Canadian Artists' Representation]] (CARFAC), an artists' advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carfac.ca/membership/fees/ CAFRAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plique-à-jour''''' (French for "letting in daylight") is a [[vitreous enamel]]ling technique where the enamel is applied in cells, similar to [[cloisonné]], but with no backing in the final product, so light can shine through the transparent or translucent enamel. It is in effect a miniature version of [[stained-glass]] and is considered very challenging technically:  high time consumption (up to 4 months per item), with a high failure rate.  The technique is similar to that of [[cloisonné]], but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-40; Ostoia, 78; [http://www.glass-on-metal.com/pastart/pliqueajour.htm ''Plique à Jour - Yesterdays Technique Today''], Bill Helwig, June 1992, Glass on Metal magazine&lt;/ref&gt; A different technique relies solely on [[surface tension]], for smaller areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SX29QC99mS8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Byzantine+plique-%C3%A0-jour+enamel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KEjVTfDiI8vAtAaF1uSKDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Art of Fine Enameling''], Karen L. Cohen, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the technique is known as '''shotai-jippo''' (shotai shippo), and is found from the 19th century on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O119856/bowl/ Japanese bowl] in the V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The technique was developed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phokani.ge/pdf/enamel_eng.pdf Georgian Art Studio Phokani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langantiques.com/pages/decorative_periods/art-nouveau-period Lang Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Byzantine plique-à-jour survived in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[icon]]s. The technique of plique-à-jour was adopted by [[Kievan Russia]] (strong trading partner of [[Constantinople]]) with other enamel techniques. Despite its complexity plique-à-jour tableware (especially "[[kovsh]]" bowls) was used by its aristocracy. Russian masters significantly developed plique-à-jour technique: in addition to cells cut in precious metal they worked with cells made of silver wire. Unfortunately the plique-à-jour technique of [[Kievan Russia]] was lost after the crushing [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century. Some surviving examples are exhibited in the Historical Museum in Moscow.

Western Europe adopted the plique-à-jour technique (cells cut in metal) of Byzantium.  The term 'smalta clara' ("clear enamel"), probably meaning ''plique à jour'' appears in 1295 in the inventory of [[Pope Boniface VIII]]&lt;ref&gt;Labarte, Histoire des arts industriels, iii, Paris, 1865, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; and the French term itself appears in inventories from the 14th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pgYqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZR_VTbilGY_4sgaIk42jDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=plique-%C3%A0-jour&amp;f=false ''Recherches sur la peinture en émail dans l'antiquité et au moyen âge''], Jules Labarte, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571) gives a full description of the process in his Treatises of Benvenuto Cellini on Gold-smithing and Sculpture of 1568. Pre-19th century pieces are extremely rare because of their "extreme fragility ... which increases greatly with their size", and the difficulty of the technique.  Survivals "are almost exclusively small ornamental pieces". The outstanding early examples that survive are "the decorative insets in the early fifteenth-century [[Mérode Cup]] (Burgundian cup) at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, a Swiss early sixteenth-century plique-a-jour enamel plaque representing the family of the Virgin Mary in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/collection_database/medieval_art/plaque_with_the_virgin_and_child//objectview.aspx?OID=170008038&amp;collID=17&amp;dd1=17 Plaque in Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt; and the eight pinnacle points over the front of the eleventh-century [[Saint Stephen's Crown]] in Hungary".&lt;ref&gt;Ostoia, 78&lt;/ref&gt;   The technique was lost in both Western and Eastern Europe.

The technique was revived in the late 19th century movement of revivalist jewellery, and became especially popular in Russia and Scandinavia. Works by [[Pavel Ovchinikov]], [[Ivan Khlebnikov]], and some masters working for [[Faberge]] are real masterpieces of plique-à-jour. Russian masters predominately worked with tableware.  Norwegian jewellers included David Andersen and J. Tostrup in Oslo,&lt;ref&gt;Marit Guinness Aschan and Rika Smith McNally. "Enamel." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 28 July 2010 [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T026009 Subscription required].&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Hummer in Bergen.  [[Art nouveau]] artists such as [[René Lalique]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/tchan_5_04.shtm National Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; and other French and German artists predominantly used plique-à-jour in small jewellery, though the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum has a tray of 1901 by [[Eugene Feuillâtre]] (1870–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O88346/ring-tray/ Ring-tray by Eugene Feuillâtre], V&amp;A.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently plique-à-jour still not often used because it is challenging technically and mainly due to break in transferring of skills between generations of jewelers. Although some luxury houses ([[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] in jewellery, [[Bulushoff]] in jewellery and tableware) produce limited numbers of products in plique-à-jour technique.  Works in shotai shippo technique are also known from China and Iran.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Techniques==
There are four basic ways of creating plique-a-jour:

1. Filigree plique-a-jour ("Russian plique-a-jour"): This is a building up process whereby a planned design is interpreted using gold or silver wires which are worked over a metal form (i.e. bowl). Wires are twisted or engraved, e.g. have additional micro patterns. The wires are soldered together. Enamels are ground and applied to each "cell" created by the metal wirework. The piece is fired in a kiln. This process of placing and firing the enamels is repeated until all cells are completely filled. Usually it takes up to 15-20 repeats.

2. Pierced plique-a-jour ("Western plique-a-jour"): A sheet of gold or silver is pierced and sawed, cutting out a desired design. This leaves empty spaces or "cells" to fill with enamel powders (ground glass).

3. Shotai shippo ("Japanese plique-a-jour"): A layer of flux (clear enamel) is fired over a copper form. Wires are fired onto the flux (similar to cloisonné) and the resulting areas are enameled in the colors of choice. When all the enameling is finished, the copper base is etched away leaving a translucent shell of plique-a-jour.

4. Cloisonné on mica: Cells in precious metal are covered with fixed mica, which is stitched out with abrasives after enameling.

A '''portrait''' is a [[portrait painting|painting]], [[portrait photography|photograph]], [[sculpture]], or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, [[Personality type|personality]], and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]], but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer.

==History==

Most early representations that are clearly intended to show an individual are of rulers, and tend to follow idealizing artistic conventions, rather than the individual features of the subject's body, though when there is no other evidence as to the ruler's appearance the degree of idealization can be hard to assess.  Nonetheless, many subjects, such as [[Akhenaten]] and some other Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s, can be recognised by their distinctive features. The 28 surviving rather small [[statues of Gudea]], ruler of [[Lagash]] in [[Sumeria]] between c. 2144 - 2124 BC, show a consistent appearance with some individuality.

Some of the earliest surviving painted portraits of people who were not rulers are the Greco-Roman [[Fayum mummy portraits|funeral portraits]] that survived in the dry climate of Egypt's [[Fayum]] district. These are almost the only paintings from the classical world that have survived, apart from [[fresco]]s, though many sculptures and portraits on coins have fared better.  Although the appearance of the figures differs considerably, they are considerably idealized, and all show relatively young people, making it uncertain whether they were painted from life.

The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially [[Roman sculpture]], where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. During the 4th century, the portrait began to retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Theodosius I]] at their entries.) In the [[Europe]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] representations of individuals are mostly generalized.  True portraits of the outward appearance of individuals re-emerged in the late [[Middle Ages]], in [[tomb monument]]s, [[donor portrait]]s, miniatures in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and then [[panel painting]]s.

[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of Peru was one of the few ancient civilizations which produced portraits. These works accurately represent anatomical features in great detail. The individuals portrayed would have been recognizable without the need for other symbols or a written reference to their names. The individuals portrayed were members of the ruling elite, priests, warriors and even distinguished artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Donnan, Christopher B. ''Moche Portraits from Ancient Peru'' University of Texas Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-292-71622-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were represented during several stages of their lives. The faces of gods were also depicted. To date, no portraits of women have been found. There is particular emphasis on the representation of the details of headdresses, hairstyles, body adornment and face painting.

One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which is a painting of [[Lisa del Giocondo]]. What has been claimed as the world's oldest known portrait was found in 2006 in the [[Vilhonneur]] grotto near [[Angoulême]] and is thought to be 27,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jun/06/art | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Jones | title=Old masters | date=6 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cave face 'the oldest portrait on record' |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2211142,00.html |publisher=The Times |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |location=London |first=Adam |last=Sage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724131845/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2211142,00.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-portraiture==
[[File:Maria Razumovskaya by Vigée-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|Late 18th Century portrait by [[Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]]]]
{{main article|Self-portrait}}
When the artist creates a portrait of him- or herself, it is called a ''self-portrait''. Identifiable examples become numerous in the late Middle Ages. But if the definition is extended, the first was by the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]'s sculptor Bak, who carved a representation of himself and his wife Taheri c. 1365 BC. However, it seems likely that self-portraits go back to the [[cave paintings]], the earliest representational art, and literature records several classical examples that are now lost.

==Official portrait==
[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rembrandt Peale]], ''Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'', 1805. [[New-York Historical Society]].]]
The official portrait is a photographic production of record and dissemination of important personalities, notably kings, presidents and governors. It is usually decorated with official colors and symbols such as flag, presidential stripes and coat of arms of countries, states or municipalities. There is also connotation as an image of events, products and meetings&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese Almanac of Photography, 1957 edition, Mário Nogueira. [[Lisbon]], Portugal, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Portrait photography==
{{main article|Portrait photography}}

Portrait photography is a popular commercial industry all over the world. Many people enjoy having professionally made ''family portraits'' to hang in their homes, or special portraits to commemorate certain events, such as graduations or weddings.
[[File:DSC 7424 (34067852616).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portrait of a family]]
Since the dawn of photography, people have made portraits. The popularity of the [[daguerreotype]] in the middle of the 19th century was due in large part to the demand for inexpensive portraiture. Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day. The style of these early works reflected the technical challenges associated with 30-second exposure times and the [[painterly]] aesthetic of the time. Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors.

As photographic techniques developed, an intrepid group of photographers took their talents out of the studio and onto battlefields, across oceans and into remote wilderness. [[William Shew]]'s ''Daguerreotype Saloon'', [[Roger Fenton]]'s ''Photographic Van'' and [[Mathew Brady]]'s ''What-is-it?'' wagon set the standards for making portraits and other photographs in the field.

==Politics==
In [[politics]], portraits of the leader are often used as a [[symbol]] of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. In most countries it is common protocol for a portrait of the [[head of state]] to appear in important [[government]] buildings. Excessive use of a leader's portrait, such as that done of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], or [[Mao Zedong]], can be indicative of a [[personality cult]].

==Literature==
{{main article|Portrait (literature)}}
In [[literature]] the term ''portrait'' refers to a written description or analysis of a person or thing. A written portrait often gives deep insight, and offers an analysis that goes far beyond the superficial. For example, American author [[Patricia Cornwell]] wrote a best-selling book entitled ''[[Portrait of a Killer]]'' about the personality, background, and possible motivations of [[Jack the Ripper]], as well as the media coverage of his murders, and the subsequent police investigation of his crimes.

'''Robert von Haug''' (27 May 1857, [[Stuttgart]] - 3 April 1922, Stuttgart) was a German [[impressionist]] painter, illustrator and lithographer who specialized in scenes from the  "[[German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)|Befreiungskriege]]".

== Life ==
From 1872 to 1877, he was enrolled at the {{ill|Stuttgart Kunstschule|de|Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart}}, then spent two years at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where he studied with [[Carl von Häberlin]], [[Bernhard von Neher]] and [[Otto Seitz]]. While there, he was a close associate of [[Karl Stauffer-Bern]] and [[Ludwig von Herterich]]. In 1879, he returned to Stuttgart. His first major exhibitions came after 1883, including one at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], but his chief occupation was book illustrating. He also painted frescoes for the Stuttgart City Hall.

He became a Professor at the Kunstschule in 1894. From 1912 to 1916 he was also the school's Director. One of his best-known students was [[Carl Geist]]. Around 1912 a dispute began between the [[Avant-garde]] faction led by [[Adolf Hölzel]] and the Traditionalists, with whom Haug sided. He was replaced as Director by Hölzel, who resigned three years later when the school rejected [[Paul Klee]] for a teaching post.&lt;ref&gt;Meinrad Schaab, Hansmartin Schwarzmaier (ed.): ''Handbuch der baden-württembergischen Geschichte.''

Because its appearance is identical in three distinct orientations, its rotational symmetry is three-fold.]]
'''Rotational symmetry''', also known as '''radial symmetry''' in biology, is the property, a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks the same.

== Formal treatment ==
{{See also|Rotational invariance}} 
Formally the  rotational symmetry is [[symmetry]] with respect to some or all [[rotation]]s in ''m''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Rotations are [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]], i.e., [[Isometry|isometries]] preserving [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]. Therefore a [[symmetry group]] of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''m'') (see [[Euclidean group]]).

Symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies [[translational symmetry]] with respect to all translations, so space is homogeneous, and the symmetry group is the whole ''E''(''m''). With the [[Symmetry#Mathematical model for symmetry|modified notion of symmetry for vector fields]] the symmetry group can also be ''E''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''m'').

For symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(''m''), the group of ''m''×''m'' [[orthogonal matrices]] with determinant 1. For {{math|1=''m'' = 3}} this is the [[rotation group SO(3)]].

In another meaning of the word, the rotation group ''of an object'' is the symmetry group within ''E''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''), the [[Euclidean group|group of direct isometries]]; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.

Laws of physics [[isotropy|are SO(3)-invariant]] if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of [[Noether's theorem]], rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the [[angular momentum]] conservation law.

===Discrete rotational symmetry===
'''Rotational symmetry of order&amp;nbsp;''n''''', also called '''''n''-fold rotational symmetry''', or '''discrete rotational symmetry of the ''n''th order''', with respect to a particular point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D) means that rotation by an angle of 360°/n (180°, 120°, 90°, 72°, 60°, 51&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|7}}°, etc.) does not change the object.  Note that "1-fold" symmetry is no symmetry (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360°).

The [[Crystal system#Overview of point groups by crystal system|notation]] for ''n''-fold symmetry is '''''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''''' or simply "''n''". The actual [[symmetry group]] is specified by the point or axis of symmetry, together with the ''n''. For each point or axis of symmetry, the abstract group type is [[cyclic group]] of order&amp;nbsp;''n'', Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Although for the latter also the notation ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is used, the geometric and abstract ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see [[Point groups in three dimensions#Cyclic symmetry groups in 3D cyclic symmetry groups|cyclic symmetry groups in 3D]].

The [[fundamental domain]] is a sector of 360°/n.

Examples without additional [[reflection symmetry]]:
*''n'' = 2, 180°: the ''dyad''; among the [[quadrilateral]]s, the [[parallelogram]]s, which have this as a fully identifying (necessary and sufficient) feature; letters Z, N, S; the outlines, albeit not the colors, of the [[yin and yang]] symbol; the [[Union Flag]] (as divided along the flag's diagonal and rotated about the flag's center point)
*''n'' = 3, 120°: ''triad'', [[triskelion]], [[Borromean rings]], [[Mitsubishi]] logo; sometimes the term ''trilateral symmetry'' is used;
*''n'' = 4, 90°: ''tetrad'', [[swastika]]
*''n'' = 6, 60°: ''hexad'', [[Star of David]]
*''n'' = 8, 45°: ''octad'', Octagonal [[muqarnas]], computer-generated (CG), ceiling

''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation group of a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] in 2D and of a regular ''n''-sided [[pyramid]] in 3D.

If there is e.g. rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100°, then also with respect to one of 20°, the [[greatest common divisor]] of 100° and 360°.

A typical 3D object with rotational symmetry (possibly also with perpendicular axes) but no mirror symmetry is a [[propeller]].

===Multiple symmetry axes through the same point===
For [[discrete symmetry]] with multiple symmetry axes through the same point, there are the following possibilities:
*In addition to an ''n''-fold axis, ''n'' perpendicular 2-fold axes: the [[dihedral group]]s ''D''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of order&amp;nbsp;2''n'' ({{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}). This is the rotation group of a regular [[prism (geometry)|prism]], or regular [[bipyramid]]. Although the same notation is used, the geometric and abstract ''D''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see [[Dihedral group#Dihedral symmetry groups in 3D|dihedral symmetry groups in 3D]].
*4×3-fold and 3×2-fold axes: the rotation group ''T'' of order&amp;nbsp;12 of a regular [[tetrahedron]]. The group is [[isomorphic]] to [[alternating group]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. 
*3×4-fold, 4×3-fold, and 6×2-fold axes: the rotation group&amp;nbsp;''O'' of order&amp;nbsp;24 of a [[cube]] and a regular [[octahedron]]. The group is isomorphic to [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. 
*6×5-fold, 10×3-fold, and 15×2-fold axes: the rotation group&amp;nbsp;''I'' of order&amp;nbsp;60 of a [[dodecahedron]] and an [[icosahedron]]. The group is isomorphic to alternating group&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The group contains 10 versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 6 versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' (rotational symmetries like prisms and antiprisms).

In the case of the [[Platonic solid]]s, the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges, and the number of them is half the number of edges. The other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces, except in the case of the tetrahedron, where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face.

===Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle===&lt;!-- [[axisymmetric]], [[axisymmetrical]] and [[axisymmetry]] redirect to here --&gt;
Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle is, in two dimensions, [[circular symmetry]]. The fundamental domain is a [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|half-line]].

In three dimensions we can distinguish '''cylindrical symmetry''' and '''spherical symmetry''' (no change when rotating about one axis, or for any rotation). That is, no dependence on the angle using [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)#Cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical coordinates]] and no dependence on either angle using [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)#Spherical coordinates|spherical coordinates]]. The fundamental domain is a [[half-plane]] through the axis, and a radial half-line, respectively. '''Axisymmetric''' or '''axisymmetrical''' are [[adjective]]s which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry, or '''axisymmetry''' (i.e. rotational symmetry with respect to a central axis) like a [[doughnut]] ([[torus]]). An example of approximate spherical symmetry is the Earth (with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties).

In 4D, continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2D rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane, about the point of intersection. An object can also have  rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes, e.g. if it is the [[Cartesian product]] of two rotationally symmetry 2D figures, as in the case of e.g. the [[duocylinder]] and various regular [[duoprism]]s.

===Rotational symmetry with translational symmetry===

|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p4.png|160px]]&lt;BR&gt;Arrangement within a [[primitive cell]] of 2- and 4-fold rotocenters. A [[fundamental domain]] is indicated in yellow.
|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p6.png|240px]]&lt;BR&gt;Arrangement within a primitive cell of 2-, 3-, and 6-fold rotocenters, alone or in combination (consider the 6-fold symbol as a combination of a 2- and a 3-fold symbol); in the case of 2-fold symmetry only, the shape of the [[parallelogram]] can be different. For the case p6, a fundamental domain is indicated in yellow.
|}
2-fold rotational symmetry together with single [[translational symmetry]] is one of the [[Frieze group]]s. There are two rotocenters per [[primitive cell]].

Together with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the  following [[wallpaper group]]s, with axes per primitive cell:
*p2 (2222): 4×2-fold; rotation group of a [[parallelogram]]mic, [[rectangle|rectangular]], and [[rhombus|rhombic]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]].
*p3 (333): 3×3-fold; ''not'' the rotation group of any lattice (every lattice is upside-down the same, but that does not apply for this symmetry); it is e.g. the rotation group of the [[Tilings of regular polygons#Regular tilings|regular triangular tiling]] with the  equilateral triangles alternatingly colored. 
*p4 (442): 2×4-fold, 2×2-fold; rotation group of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice.
*p6 (632): 1×6-fold, 2×3-fold, 3×2-fold; rotation group of a [[hexagonal]] lattice.
*2-fold rotocenters (including possible 4-fold and 6-fold), if present at all, form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice, scaled by a factor 1/2. In the case translational symmetry in one dimension, a similar property applies, though the term "lattice" does not apply.
*3-fold rotocenters (including possible 6-fold), if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 30° (or equivalently 90°), and scaled by a factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} \sqrt {3}&lt;/math&gt;
*4-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 45°, and scaled by a factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \sqrt {2}&lt;/math&gt;
*6-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational lattice.

Scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor. Therefore the number of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold, etc.

3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one (or ditto in 3D with respect to parallel axes) implies rotation group p6, i.e. double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point (or, in 3D, parallel axis). The translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is 2{{radic|3}} times their distance.

The term is typically not applied to crew or department heads, although there are exceptions. The running crew may include performers if they also function in technical capacities while offstage.

==Crew positions==
A typical running crew will include any or all of the following positions, depending on the nature and size of the production, and the complexity of the technical requirements. Each position is organised by the most common title; depending on the country, type of production, and producing organisation, different titles may be used for the same position.

===Stage management===
* [[Stage management|Assistant stage manager]]: Assists the [[Stage management|stage manager]] in their duties. Generally one assistant stage manager is in charge of running backstage operation during a show.
* [[Theatrical property|Props]]: responsible for maintenance and placement of hand props before scenes as well as their subsequent retrieval after the scene.
* [[Call boy (theatre)|Call boy]]: responsible for alerting actors and actresses of their entrances in time for them to appear on stage, on cue.

===Lighting===
* [[Light board operator]]: operates the [stage lighting|lighting control system]. Sometimes this is integrated with the [[show control]] system.
* [[Electrician_(theater)#Deck_Electrician|Deck Electrician]]: responsible for placing, connecting and/or operating stage lighting units, such as stage lights. Sometimes, they are necessary to have during scene changes, in the case of moving set pieces with lighting equipment inside. Typically, more than one will be backstage.
* [[Master Electrician]]: responsible for the maintenance and operation of dimming &amp; power distribution systems during a performance, including "hot" or "live" patching. Occasionally, some of these duties could also be delegated to the run crew's deck electricians.
* [[Spotlight operator|Spotlight Operator]] (or follow spot operator): operates a type of lighting instrument called a [[follow spot]], which allows a performer to be lit evenly no matter where on stage they may go. Can typically be found in the [[Control Booth|lighting booth]], along with the light board op. Also, some theaters have follow spots located above a false ceiling, on the [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]].

===Sound===
* [[Sound operator]] (A1): operates the [[Mixing console|sound board]] and/or audio control system specified by the [[sound designer]], computerised or otherwise. Sometimes this is integrated with the [[show control]] system. There can be multiple sound board ops.
* [[A2 (theater)|Mic wrangler]] (A2): manages microphones and maintains headsets as a show runs. Usually there are several mic wranglers located backstage, in the [[Wings_(theater)#Stage|wings]], with the running crew.

===Stage===
* [[Flymen]] (or fly crew/rail crew): operate the [[fly system]], a system of ropes or wires, pulleys and counterweights by means of which [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] is "flown" in and out (down and up, respectively) during scene changes.
* [[Stagehand]]: A [[technician]] responsible for moving scenery at the stage level, by manually carrying or rolling set pieces (e.g., [[scenery wagon]]s) between the stage and the wings. This can include carrying on and off furniture, props, or scenery.

===Wardrobe===
* [[Wardrobe]]: A "dresser" (who works for Wardrobe) is responsible for maintenance and placement of [[costume]]s, as well as assisting performers in getting into and out of [[costume]]s.
* [[Makeup]]: responsible for applying or assisting in the application of [[face paint|face]] and [[body painting|body]] paints, [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] and hairpieces, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ruyi''' ({{zh|c=如意|l=as desired; as [you] wish}}) is a curved decorative object that serves as a ceremonial [[sceptre]] in [[Chinese Buddhism]] or a [[amulet|talisman]] symbolizing power and good fortune in [[Chinese folklore]]. A traditional ''ruyi'' has a long S-shaped handle and a head fashioned like a fist, cloud, or [[lingzhi mushroom]]. ''Ruyi'' are constructed from diverse materials. For example, the [[Palace Museum]] in [[Beijing]] has nearly 3000 ''ruyi'' that are variously made from valuable materials like gold, silver, iron, bamboo, wood, ivory, coral, rhinoceros horn, lacquer, crystal, jade, and precious gems. The "ruyi" image frequently appears as a motif in Asian art.

==Word==
The Chinese term ''ruyi'' is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''ru'' [[Wikt:如|如]] "as; like; such as; as if; for example; supposing; be like; be similar; accord with" and ''yi'' [[Wikt:意|意]] "wish; will; desire; intention; suggestion; thought; idea; meaning; imagination". 

[[Standard Chinese]] uses ''ruyi'' either as a [[stative verb]] meaning "as desired; as one wishes, as one likes; according to one's wishes; following your heart's desires", or as an [[adjective]] meaning "satisfied, pleased, happy, comfortable". The word is combined with ''suanpan'' 算盤 "[[abacus]]" in the expression ''ruyi suanpan'' "wishful thinking; smug calculations". 

Chinese ''ruyi'' was borrowed as a Buddhist [[loanword]] into [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], with corresponding [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] (see Infobox above).

==History==
[[File:HB-Ruyi.JPG|thumb|left|Qing Dynasty wood and jade three-inlay ''ruyi'']]

[[Chinese classic texts]] from the Former [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 24 AD) have the earliest usages of the word ''ruyi''. For example, the ''[[Shiji]]'' history uses it both literally for "as desired" and for the given name of [[Liu Ruyi]] 劉如意 (d. 195 BC), who was the son of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] and [[Concubine Qi]]. The ''[[Hanshu]]'' biography of the ''[[fangshi]]'' astrologer and mathematician [[Jing Fang]] (78–37 BCE) quotes him using ''ruyi'' meaning "as you wish" in an audience with [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (tr. Edkins 1904: 238), "I fear that though your Majesty acts in this way you will still not obtain what accords with your wish."
[[File:Chinese Ruyi Scepter.png|thumb|Chinese ruyi scepter crafted of hardwood with foliate silver inlay and five white nephrite jade insets. Qing Dynasty, 19th Century]]
The anthropologist [[Berthold Laufer]] (1912:336) said that the Chinese accounts of the ''ruyi'' are "more unsatisfactory" than for any other object in [[Chinese culture]]. Scholars have proposed two basic theories for the origin of the ''ruyi'', writes Kieschnick (2003:141). The former is that ''ruyi'' originated from Sanskrit ''anuruddha'' "a ceremonial scepter" used by Buddhist monks in India, who later brought it to China, transliterated as ''analu'' 阿那律 or translated as ''ruyi''. The latter theory is that ''ruyi'' originated as a [[backscratcher]] in early China, and was amalgamated with the Buddhist symbol of authority. Davidson (1950:239) suggests "as desired" signifies a backscratcher owing to "its apparent ability to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the human body".

During the Later Han dynasty (25–220 AD) and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420 AD), literati and nobles often held ''ruyi'' during conversations and other social occasions. It was called a ''tanbing'' 談柄 "conversation baton" (cf. the Native American [[talking stick]]) and was used much like ''zhuwei'' 麈尾 "deer tail; fly-whisk", which practitioners of the ''[[qingtan]]'' 清談 "pure conversation" movement popularized during the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220–589 AD). Besides the ''ruyi'', other objects used as a ''tanbing'' "discussion stick" included the ''tanshan'' 談扇 "discussion fan" and ''tanzhu'' 談麈 made from the tail of a [[Père David's deer]]. Davidson (1950:247) says "there seems no doubt that the primary and original function of the ''ju-i'' was that of a scepter qualifying the holder to "take the floor." Its origin was probably in India where the branch of a tree seems to have served a similar function. Any other purposes the ''ju-i'' served, such as a note tablet, honorific insignia, good luck gift, or even backscratcher, were merely later accruals."

The ca. 554 AD ''[[Weishu]]'' history records a story that when [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei]] (r. 471–499 AD) wanted to retire from the throne, he tested his sons by letting them choose among a number objects, and the one who selected a bone ''ruyi'' (symbolizing political rule) became [[Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei]] (r. 500–515). Kieschnick (2003:144) concludes "that by the end of the sixth century, not only was the ''ruyi'' common at court, but it had even begun to take on emblematic significance as the mark of a ruler." Although the ''ruyi'' symbolized imperial political power, it differed from the Western royal scepter because Chinese officials and monks commonly used it.

In Buddhist usage, holding a ''ruyi'' when teaching gave the holder the right to talk. The biography of [[Tiantai]] Buddhist patriarch [[Zhiyi]] (538-597) says that when he was teaching ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]]'' in place of his teacher [[Huisi]] 慧思 (515–577), Huisi would sit holding a ''ruyi'' in his hand (Davidson 1950:244).

The (c. 886) ''Duyang zabian'' 杜陽雜編, which is a collection of [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) stories, records that [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]] presented an ivory ''ruyi'' to his tutor Li Xun 李訓 (d. 835) and said (tr. Kieschnick 2003:145), "The ''ruyi'' may serve you as a lecture baton (''tanbing'')." The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' biography of Li Xun (tr. Davidson 1950:247) says this occurred on a hot summer day and the emperor's ''ruyi'' present was made from "heat-repelling [[Rhinoceros#Horn trade and use|rhinoceros horn]]", which is believed to be cooling in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]. ''Ruyi'' were both emblems of power and tools of discourse. 

[[Herbert Giles]] (1912:185) quoted the [[Song dynasty]] archaeologist Zhao Xigu 趙希鵠 (d. 1240) that the ''ruyi'' "was originally made of iron, and was used 'for pointing the way' and also 'for guarding against the unexpected,' i.e. for self-defence. It was, in fact, a kind of blunt sword, and traces of basket-work are still to be found inside what must have been the sword-guard." 

In the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), ''ruyi'' became popular as ornaments or gifts symbolizing blessings and good luck. The ca. 1627 AD ''Zhangwuzhi'' 長物志 "Treatise on Superfluous Things", by Ming painter [[Wen Zhenheng]], discussed ''ruyi'' aesthetics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''ruyi'' was used in ancient times to give directions or to protect oneself from the unexpected. It was for this reason that it was made or iron, and not on the basis of strictly aesthetic considerations. If you can obtain an old iron ''ruyi'' inlaid with gold and silver that sparkle now and then, and if it has an ancient dull color, this is the best. As for ''ruyi'' made of natural branches or from bamboo and so on, these are all worthless. (tr. Kieschnick 2003:151) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912 AD), ''ruyi'' scepters became luxuriant symbols of political power that were regularly used in imperial ceremonies, and were highly valued as gifts to and from the [[Emperor of China]]. Since 3 and 9 are considered lucky [[numbers in Chinese culture]], Qing craftsmen elaborated the traditional handle and head type ''ruyi'' into two-headed ''sanjiang-ruyi'' 三鑲如意 "3-inlay ''ruyi''" with precious stones set in both heads and middle of the handle and ''jiujiu-ruyi'' 九九如意 "9-9 ''ruyi''" presentational sets of nine. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] presented a ''ruyi'' to the British ambassador [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|George Macartney]] in 1793, and in his description (quoted by Kieschnick 2003:139-140), "It is a whitish, agate-looking stone, about a foot and a half long, curiously carved, and highly prized by the Chinese, but to me it does not appear in itself to be of any great value."

During the historical evolution of Chinese ''ruyi'' "as desired", they have been used as backscratchers, ritual objects in Buddhism and later [[Daoism]], pointers for public speakers, prized icons of political power and wealth, and auspicious gifts expressing best wishes.

==Art==

In [[Chinese art]], ''ruyi'' scepters often appear as attributes of Buddhist [[saint]]s and Daoist [[xian (Taoism)|''xian'']]. The god of prosperity [[Cai Shen]] 財神 is often depicted holding a ruyi. Stylized repetitions of the shape are incorporated as a motif in the depiction of heavenly clouds. ''Ruyi'' symbolize achieving prosperity in ''[[fengshui]]'' practice. The ''ruyi'' shape appears as a motif in decorative knots, [[Oriental rug]] patterns, folk artifacts, and even modern corporate logos. Stylized ''ruyi'' often function as a kind of [[ante-fixae]] or [[palmette]] in traditional and modern [[Chinese architecture|architecture]].

Two types of ''ruyi'' are seen in Chinese [[Buddhist art]]. The early ''ruyi'' was common in Buddhist sculpture and painting from the late [[Six dynasties]] (220–589) through the Tang dynasty (618–906). It was a slender stick, varying from about 15 to 24 inches, which widened and curved slightly at one end. Not only were these utensils frequently portrayed by artists and sculptors, but the [[Shōsōin]] treasure house of [[Tōdai-ji]] temple, in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], has preserved several 8th-century ''ruyi'' (Davidson 1950:242). The modern ''ruyi'', which first appeared in the art of the Song dynasty (960–1279) has two forms. The first type shows minor elaborations upon the basic slender-handled structure of the early ''ruyi'', but the slight curve at the top was exaggerated into a decorative ornament, a medallion-like form, frequently a stylized fungus. The second type of contemporary ''ruyi'' shows a radical change, in addition to the decorated end, two other smaller inlaid plaques or medallions, with one at the middle of the handle and the other at the base. Variations occur where the center medallion becomes a rectangle, or the second is omitted (Davidson 1950:242-243).

In early Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]] is usually depicted holding a sword (representing wisdom that cuts through ignorance), except in representations of his ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]'' discussion with the layman [[Vimalakirti]], when Manjusri holds a ''ruyi'' scepter (Davidson 1950:240). This representation expanded in the 10th century, concurrent with the change in ''ruyi'' forms, and holding a ''ruyi'' became an attribute of other divinities as well as [[Chinese emperors]] (Davidson 1950:244).

Berthold Laufer (1912: 339) believed the first Chinese representation of a ''ruyi'' was in an 8th-century Mañjuśrī painting by [[Wu Daozi]], which showed it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. Laufer noted the artistic similarly between the curved handle of a ''ruyi'' and the long stem of a lotus blossom, which was frequently depicted in the hands of Bodhisattvas, e.g., the [[Longmen Grottoes]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not mean to say that the Buddhist emblem called ''Ju-i'' has developed from the lotus, though I think that the alternation of both is suggestive. But it is not necessary at all to assume that the Chinese ''Ju-i'' in general is of Buddhist origin... It may very well be that the implement is Chinese in origin and even prebuddhistic, and that, as in so many other things, a kind of compromise took place, resulting in the assimilation and amalgamation of two ideas and two forms. (1912:339) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Admitting that the "original significance of this implement has been lost long ago", Laufer hypothesized that the ''ruyi'' may have developed from a [[Chinese jade#Six Ritual and Six Ceremonial Jades|ritual jade]] that began as a [[Zhou dynasty]] "symbol of light, generative power and fertility".

Two of the emperors in the famous ''Thirteen Emperors Scroll'' by [[Yan Liben]] (d. 673) are holding ''ruyi'' (Davidson 1950:247), [[Emperor Wen of Chen]] (r. 559–566) and [[Emperor Xuan of Chen]] (r. 569–582).

Japanese painters variously pictured Manjusri holding a ''ruyi'' in either hand (Laufer 1912:338).  [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506) showed one in his left hand and nothing in his right. Kichizan Minchō 吉山明兆 (1352–1431) and [[Kanō Sanraku]] (1559–1635) showed the Bodhisattva with a ''ruyi'' in his right and a book-roll in his left. A 12th-century Manjusri painting attributed to the [[Kose Kanaoka|Kose School]] a sword in his right and a sacred lotus-flower in his left hand.

==Word usage in East Asian Buddhism==
With the introduction of [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism to China]], scholars used Chinese ''ruyi'' {{lang|zh|如意}} to translate various [[Sanskrit]] terms, which [[Buddhism in Japan]] subsequently borrowed as ''nyoi''. The primary terms and Chinese/Japanese translations are:
*''anuruddha'' "a ceremonial mace; a priest's staff", ''ruyi''/''nyoi'' 如意
*''[[kalpavriksha]]'' "wish fulfilling tree; the manifestation of what one wishes", ''ruyishu''/''nyoiju'' 如意樹
*''[[cintamani]]'' "wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires", ''ruyizhu''/''nyoiju'' 如意珠 or ''ruyibaozhu''/''nyoi-hōshu'' 如意宝珠
First, the ''anuruddha''/''ruyi''/''nyoi'' scepter is defined in the ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;An instrument held, especially by the abbot of a temple, during ceremonies and sermons shaped as a short staff curled in an S-shape and made out of wood, or more precious materials, such as ivory. One end is broader than the other, and often has a metal plate with a decorative cloud-shaped stamp. It is said to originally have been a back-scratcher that was carried by Buddhist monks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some schools of [[Zen]] like [[Sanbo Kyodan]], the ceremonial scepter of a ''[[rōshi]]'' is called ''kotsu'' {{nihongo|bone, relic|骨|kotsu}} instead of ''nyoi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The scepter has a slight S-shaped curve, like a human spinal column. The rōshi uses the ''kotsu'', for example, to emphasize a point in a ''teishō'', to lean on when sitting, or also occasionally to strike a student. (Diener, Erhard, and Fischer-Schreiber 1991:119) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the divine ''kalpavriksha''/''ruyishu''/''nyoiju'' is a [[wishing tree]] in [[Hindu mythology]]. The Buddhist translator [[Samuel Beal]] (1884:105) explained it denotes "power to produce whatever was wished". The Chinese Buddhist monk Yi Jing 義凈, who travelled in India from 673 to 695, translated ''kalpavriksha'' as ''ruyishu'' in describing the [[Uposatha]] day celebration (tr. [[Takakusu Junjiro|Takakusu]] 1896:49), "Then gifts are distributed. Sometimes the host provides a 'wishing tree' (Kalpa-vriksha), and gives it to the priests". Since it is unlikely that a real tree could have been given, Davidson (1950:247) notes that "some sort of symbolic tree was deemed appropriate as a gift to a Buddhist priest." 

Third, the legendary ''cintamani'' "wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires" is translated either with ''zhu''/''shu'' 珠 "pearl; bead" or ''baozhu''/''hōju'' 寶珠 "precious pearl; jewel". This famous term is frequently used in literature and art. The ''Digital Dictionary of Buddhism'' explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A ''maṇi''-jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. ''maṇi'', ''cintā-maṇi'', ''cintāmaṇi-ratna''). According to one's desires, treasures, clothing and food can be manifested, while sickness and suffering can be removed, water can be purified, etc. It is a metaphor for the teachings and virtues of the Buddha. … Said to be obtained from the dragon-king of the sea, or the head of the great fish, Makara, or the relics of a Buddha.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erik Zürcher (1997:407) suggests that association between ''ruyi'' and the legendary ''ruyibao'' "wish-fulfilling gem" explains the dichotomy between it being both a mundane backscratcher and a Buddhist symbol.

The ca. 1150 AD ''Fusō ryakki'' 扶桑略記 "Brief History of [[Fusang]]" by Kōen 皇圓, the teacher of [[Hōnen]], recounts a Japanese ''nyoi-hōju'' legend involving the monk Foshi {{lang|zh|佛誓}} "Buddha's Vow" (Japanese ''Bussei'').
&lt;blockquote&gt;There lived in Northern India a Buddhist abbot, "Buddha's vow" by name, who for the sake of mankind sought the "Precious pearl which grants all desires". He went on board a ship and, when in the midst of the sea, by Buddha's power called up the Dragon-king. After having bound him by means of mystic formulae (tantras), he required the pearl from him, whereupon the dragon, unable to escape, took the pearl from his head and prepared to hand it over to the priest. The latter stretched out his left hand, at the same time making the "sword-sign"', a mudrā (mystic finger-twisting), with his right hand. The Dragon-king, however, said: "In former times, when the Dragon-king Sāgara's daughter gave a precious pearl to Cākyamuni, the latter received it with folded hands; why should a pupil of the Buddha accept it with one hand?" Then the priest folded his hands, giving up the mudrā, and was about to take the pearl, when the Dragon-king, no longer suppressed by the mystic sign, freed himself from his bands and ascended to the sky, leaving the abbot behind with empty hands, and destroying his boat. The only man who was saved was the priest himself. Afterwards the same abbot met Bodhidharma, the patriarch, who came across the sea from Southern India (in 526), and together they went to Japan. (tr. de Visser 1913:189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two additional [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] Buddhist translations are:
*''Ruyiwutan''/''Nyoi Muton'' 如意無貪 "fulfill wishes without craving" translates Analu 阿那律 [[Anuruddha]], one of the original disciples of [[Gautama Buddha]]
*''Ruyilun''/''Nyōi-rin'' 如意輪 "wish-fulfilling wheel" or ''Ruyilun Guanyin''/''Nyoirin Kannon'' 如意輪観音  translates Sanskrit ''Cintamanicakra'', a manifestation of [[Guanyin]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, who is usually depicted with the ''cintamani'' magic jewel and the ''falun''/''nyo-rin'' 法輪 "wheel of dharma, [[dharmacakra]]"

'''''Saint Augustine in His Study''''' is a painting of [[Augustine of Hippo]] executed in 1480 by the [[Italian Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]]. It is in the church of [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] in [[Florence]].

Botticelli was born in a house in the same street as the church, still called Via Borgo Ognissanti.  He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1464 Botticelli's father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro took over in 1470 and lived in for the rest of his life.  Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including [[Amerigo Vespucci]], born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named.  The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was commissioned by the Vespucci family, probably Amerigo's father Nastaglio, a [[notary]], and his brother Giorgio Antonio, both neighbours of Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Someone else, probably the order running the church,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] to do a facing ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|Saint Jerome]]''; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects.  As in other cases, such direct competition "was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 73–78, 74 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which mark them as scholars and precursors of [[Renaissance Humanism]].  There is known to have been a small painting of Jerome in his study said to have been by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the Medici collection, which is now lost.  This may have influenced both frescos.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

They decorated the screen of the unusually located choir, which was demolished in 1564–1566, when they were detached and moved to the nave.  They are now in the refectory, moved there after sustaining slight damage in the [[1966 flood of the Arno]].  In the first move part of the frame with its inscriptions went lost, and all of Jerome's.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 74–76; Legouix, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It portrays [[Augustine of Hippo]] in meditation inside his study.  The precise subject is a legend, probably first found in the 13th century, of a vision Augustine had as he began to write a letter to [[Jerome]] in his study at Hippo in 420.  The time is shown on the clock by his head as the end of the twenty-fourth hour, counting from the previous sunset.  This is the hour of [[Compline]], specified in the legend.  A light and sweet odour came into his study and a voice told him that "he might as soon enclose the ocean in a small vessel, as soon clasp the whole earth in his fist, as soon halt the movement of the heavens as describe the beatitude of the saints without having experienced it", as the speaker was now doing.  When Augustine asked who he was, he replied he was Jerome. Augustine later heard that Jerome had died in [[Jerusalem]] at exactly that hour.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 76–77, 77 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms visible in the upper part is that of the Vespucci family; Jerome has no equivalent arms.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines in the book over the saint's head are mostly meaningless, apart from a line in which reads: ''Dov'è Frate Martino? È scappato. E dov'è andato? È fuor dalla [[Porta al Prato]]'' ("Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato"), probably referring to the escapades of one of the [[Humiliati|Uumiliati]], the order who ran the church.  Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 77 (different translation to same effect)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is an [[oil painting]] on panel attributed to the workshop of the [[early Netherlandish]] painter [[Jan van Eyck]], dated to 1442 (the year after the master's death) and now in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]].

==History==
Since the date on the painting is subsequent to Jan van Eyck's death (June 1441), it is likely that the work, left unfinished, had been completed by members of his workshop, or his brother Lambert.

A work with a similar subject is mentioned in the inventories of  [[Palazzo Medici]], in [[Florence]], which had been drawn up after the death of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1492. Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s [[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1480).

==Description==

The painting depicts [[Saint Jerome]] in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and [[Galero|hat]], and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests. Below is a lion, recalling the saint's legend in which he had extracted a thorn from the paw of the animal, who had later remained loyal to him. The light enters from a window behind the writing desk and from the foreground, in order to illuminate any detail of the scene. Objects on the desk and the shelves include an [[hourglass]], a [[pounce (calligraphy)|pounce pot]], a [[ruler]], an [[astrolabe]], numerous [[book]]s and writing instruments, all suitable for the idealized man of the [[Renaissance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4405">'''Spiro Konstantine Kostof''' (7 May 1936, [[Istanbul]] – 7 December 1991, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]) was a leading [[architectural historian]], and professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His books continue to be widely read and some are routinely used in collegiate courses on [[architectural history]].

Born in [[Turkey]], of Greek and Bulgarian ethnic origin, Kostof was educated at [[Istanbul]]'s [[Robert College]].  He came to the United States in 1957 for graduate work at [[Yale University]].  Although he intended to major in drama, his interests shifted to architectural history.  He received his Ph.D. in 1961, then taught at Yale for four years, before moving to the University of California to join the faculty of the [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design|College of Environmental Design]].  He was to remain at Berkeley for the duration of his career.

Kostof's approach to [[architectural history]] emphasized urbanism as well as architecture and showed how architectural works are embedded in their physical and social contexts.  Commonly accepted today, Kostof's approach was a break with previous directions in architectural history which tended to emphasize the sequence of styles and to study architectural works in relative isolation from their settings.  Kostof's textbook, ''A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals'' (1985) embodied these ideas and soon became one of the standard texts in the field.

In 1987, Kostof hosted a five-part [[PBS]] series, ''America by Design''.

Kostof's publications were wide-ranging and included ''The Architect: Chapters in the History of the Profession''; ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History''; ''America by Design''; and ''The City Assembled: Elements of Urban Form through History''.

In 1993, following his death, the [[Society of Architectural Historians]] established the "'''Spiro Kostof Award'''", to recognize books "in the spirit of Kostof's writings," particularly those that are interdisciplinary and whose content focuses on urban development, the history of urban form, and/or the architecture of the built environment.

'''''Earthstopper on the Banks of the Derwent''''' is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] originally completed in 1773. The scene shows a man digging at nighttime beside the [[River Derwent (Derbyshire)|River Derwent]] in Derbyshire.

==Description==
The painting shows a man blocking foxholes so that a subsequent foxhunt could kill the fox without the animal having the opportunity to hide underground. This man was known as an ''Earthstopper''.

Joseph Wright was known for his studies under unusual lighting and this can be seen here combined with landscape. Wright completed few notable paintings that included landscapes before he went on his tour of Italy where he created a large number including those that showed the eruption of [[Vesuvias]]. [[Benedict Nicolson]], who was an authority on Joseph Wright believed this painting inspired lines of poetry&lt;ref name=nicolson&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby:Painter of Light p.97|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:HaA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a_DjTaGTKo6xhAfb14HzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=needwood&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a collection named after and in aid of the preservation of [[Needwood Forest]]. The lines were written by [[Francis Noel Clarke Mundy]], who later commissioned six Wright portraits, including one of himself. These three quarter length portraits were of himself and five of his friends in the uniform of Mundy's own private hunt. Mundy's lines read:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Whilst as the silver moonbeams rise,
:Imagin'd temples strike my eyes
:With tottering spire, and mouldering wall,
:And high roof nodding to it's fall, -
:His lanterns gleaming down the glade,
:One, like a sexton with his spade,
:Comes from their caverns to exclude
:The midnight prowlers from the wood...&lt;ref name=mundy&gt;{{cite book|last=Mundy|first=Francis Noel Clarke|title=Needwood Forest p.19|year=1776|publisher=John Jackson|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=needwood%20forest%20mundy&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=sexton&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
It is apt that Wright who had based his own paintings like [[Miravan]] on literature should, in turn, inspire poetry in the group that included [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Anna Seward]].

==History==
The painting was exhibited in 1773. It was bought by [[Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]] who became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and was the 2nd [[Earl of Hardwicke]]. The painting remained in the Earl's family until it was sold by the [[Charles Yorke, 5th Earl of Hardwicke|fifth Earl]]&lt;ref name=artfund/&gt; who was nicknamed "Champagne Charlie".&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/61/101061075/|title=Charles Yorke|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally Charles Yorke (the 5th Earl) was known for his spendthrift ways and [[Disraeli]] appointed him, at the request of the Prince of Wales, to the title of [[Master of the Buckhounds]]&lt;ref&gt;F. M. L. Thompson, ‘Yorke, Charles Philip , fifth earl of Hardwicke (1836–1897)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/61075, accessed 30 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; where he was his majesty's representative at Ascot. The painting was eventually bought by [[Benedict Nicolson]] (Wright's biographer)&lt;ref name=artfund&gt;{{cite web|title=An Earth Stopper on the Banks of the Derwent|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/3209/an-earth-stopper-on-the-banks-of-the-derwent|publisher=artfund.org|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who sold it via the Artfund into the collection of [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=derby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earthstopper|url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheEarthstopper.htm|work=Treasures of Derby|publisher=derby.gov.uk|accessdate=29 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504143827/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheEarthstopper.htm|archivedate=4 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Phoenix Project''''' is a 2015 American science fiction film written and directed by Tyler Graham Pavey.  Corey Rieger, Andrew Simpson, David Pesta, and Orson Ossman star as scientists who attempt to reanimate the dead.

== Plot ==
Perry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead.  The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand "Amps" Garner.  Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges.  Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully.  As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond.  Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.

Their first subject is an insect.  When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects.  Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse.  Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name.  The experiment is once again a failure.  Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject.  Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure.  When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved.  He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate.  Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale.  Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.

Further tests prove failures.  Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests.  Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately.  Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay.  Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps.  Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger.  Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons – his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her.  Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.

After promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved.  Perry admits that he moved the mouse himself, and Amps says that he needs time away from the project.  Devin pushes Perry to perform another test without Amps, and they experience their first unqualified success.  Although initially angry they would operate his machine without permission, Amps also becomes excited.  Perry contacts Carter, apologizes for lying about the grant, and requests that he rejoin them.  Carter returns once he hears about their success.  Meanwhile, Devin convinces Amps to secretly test on a human subject.  When Perry finds out, he threatens to call the police.  Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him.  The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak.  Perry orders them to destroy the equipment, and they leave the lab with Devin in tow.  As they put him in a car, Devin stares wide-eyed at the world around him.

'''''The Triumph of Death''''' is an [[Oil painting|oil]] [[panel painting]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] painted c. 1562.&lt;ref name="Snyder486"&gt;{{cite book |title=Northern Renaissance Art: Painting, Sculpture, the Graphic Arts from 1350 to 1575 |last= Snyder|first=James |year=1985 |publisher= Harry N. Abrams|location= New York|isbn=0-8109-1081-0 |page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]] since 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prado, Madrid |last1= Pallucchini|first1= Anna|last2= Ragghianti| first2= Carlo Ludovico| last3=Collobi| first3= Licia Ragghianti |year= 1968|publisher= Newsweek|location= New York |page= 134 |series= Great Museums of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting shows a [[panorama]] of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks &lt;ref&gt;According to the Italian Wikipedia the background of a tower "Particular of the triumph of the death of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (the Prado, Madrid), in which the profile of (Fortification of [[Reggio Calabria]]|Reggio]]) and the Tower of Pentimele is recognized in the background, the Flemish painter was in Reggio in the sixteenth century and in this work refers to his notes of voyage in which  It describes the attack of the Pirates of Dragut on the beach of the quarter of arches."&lt;/ref&gt;.A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the "scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see."&lt;ref name="Snyder486"/&gt; In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the [[death knell]] of the world.  People are herded into a coffin shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a [[scythe]]. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds&amp;nbsp;– from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal&amp;nbsp;– being taken by death indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death Takes No Holiday |first= Richard B. |last= Woodward|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123456346044885861|newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |date= February 14, 2009|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a [[hurdy-gurdy]] while the wheels of his cart crush a man like he's nothing. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart; she has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand-Bruegel's interpretation of [[Atropos]]. Nearby another woman in the path of the cart, holds in her hand a spindle and [[distaff]], classical symbols of the fragility of human life-another Bruegel interpretation of [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis]]; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a dead child she holds. Just beside her, a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king's barrels of gold and silver coins is looted by yet another skeleton-the foolish and [[Death and the Miser|miserly]] monarch's last thoughts still compel him to reach out for his useless and vain wealth-making him oblivious of repentance. In the centre, a sleeping Religious Pilgrim has his throat cut by a robber-skeleton for his money purse; above the murder, skeleton-fishermen catch humanity in a net. In the bottom right-hand corner, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets; no less hopelessly, the jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The [[backgammon]] board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask (possibly the face of a corpse) empties away the wine flasks. Above, a woman struggles in vain while being embraced by a skeleton in a hideous parody of after-dinner [[amorous]]ness. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetiser apparently consisting of a pared human skull. As the fighting breaks out, a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table-horrifying a woman with the realisation of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gluck, ''Pieter Bruegel the Elder'', London (1958), ''s.v.'' "Triumph of Death". See also Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen, ''Bruegel: The Complete Paintings. aka Pieter Bruegel the Elder: peasants, fools and demons'', Taschen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bottom right hand corner: the only spark of humanity is represented by a [[troubadour]] who plays a [[lute]] while his lady sings; both are oblivious to the fact that behind both of them, a skeleton that plays along is grimly aware that the couple can not escape their inevitable doom. A cross sits in the centre of the painting. The painting shows aspects of everyday life in the mid-sixteenth century. Artists from this period would have had a painful recollection of the Black Death that had halved the population of Europe a few generations earlier when cartloads of corpses would have been carried. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and [[backgammon]]. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical [[clock]], scenes including a [[funeral service]], and various methods of execution, including the [[breaking wheel]], the [[gallows]], [[burning at the stake]], and the [[headsman]] about to behead a victim who has just taken wine and communion. In one scene a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs. In another scene, a man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeletons-an echoing of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18:6|Matthow Matthew 18.6]] and [[https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Luke.16:28–30:28|Luke Luke 17.2]]. 

Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern [[woodcut]]s of the [[Dance of Death]] and the [[Italian art|Italian]] conception of the ''[[Triumph of Death (Palermo)|Triumph of Death]]'', as in [[fresco]]es he would have seen in the [[Palazzo Sclafani]] in [[Palermo]] and in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]].&lt;ref&gt;P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5521">A '''theatrical producer''' is a person who oversees all aspects of mounting a [[theatre]] [[Stagecraft|production]].  The producer is responsible for the overall financial and managerial functions of a production or venue, raises or provides financial backing, and hires personnel for creative positions (writer, director, designers, composer, choreographer—and in some cases, performers).&lt;ref&gt;Practical Theatre: A Post-16 Approach, by Sally Mackey&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent producer usually initiates the production—finding the script and starting the process. The producer finds the [[Theatre director|director]] and pursues the primary goals, to balance and coordinate business and financial aspects in the service of the creative realization of the playwright's vision. This may include casting, but often only includes casting approval. The producer may secure funds for the production, either through their own company or by bringing investors into the production in a limited partnership agreement.  In this business structure, the producer becomes the general partner with unlimited liability, and because of this, often brings in other general partners. The producer probably has [[Option (films)|optioned]] the play from the [[playwright]], which includes rights to future production for film and television.  The producer earns the right to future ventures because the original theatrical production enhances the value of an artistic property. This right to further options may be included in the royalty agreement.  In other duties, the producer may work with theatrical agents, negotiate with unions, find other staff, secure the theatre and rehearsal hall, obtain liability and workers' compensation insurance, and post bonds with unions.

The producer handles the business and legal end of employing staff, as in any business entity.  Hiring creative staff and teams generally involves the director and playwright's approval. The producer hires the production team, including the general manager, [[Production management|production manager]], [[House management|house manager]], [[Stage management|stage manager]], etc., at their discretion. In many cases, contracts require that the producer use [[front of house]] staff (such as the house manager, [[box office]], ushers, etc.) and backstage personnel ([[Stagehand|stage hands]], electrician, carpenter, etc.) supplied by the theatre.

The producer creates, builds on and oversees the budget, sets ticket prices, chooses performance dates and times, and develops a marketing and advertising strategy for the production. Hiring a publicist and marketing team is one of the most important responsibilities of the producer. These teams are generally in place before the show is cast. 

The producer collaborates with the director and all staff to plan a production timeline and deadlines for various aspects of the production to ensure a successful show opening and run. The producer and director oversee this timeline, with periodic re-assessment and modifications as needed.

The producer hires accountants, and perhaps already has legal representation. This is important, because of the liability issues mentioned above.  All bills, including payroll, must be paid on time, and taxes must be paid.  The producer oversees the budget.  The theatre owner provides box office services and turns over net ticket sales revenue. If sales fall under a set minimum level, the unprofitable show may close.  If ticket sales are good and the show makes a profit, the producer may get 50% of the net profit, the other 50% going to the investors.  Statistically, highly successful shows with big profits are the exception.  Independent commercial production is a high risk business.

Another kind of producer is the non-independent, or ''[[line producer]],'' [[facilitator|who facilitates]] other people's projects.  A [[repertory]] or [[Repertoire (theatre)|repertoire]] or [[festival]] or non-profit or [[amateur]] organization, in most cases, uses a [[managing director]], and creative decisions fall to the [[artistic director]].  In theatres with no [[managing director]], artistic directors often use the title ''producing artistic director'' or ''managing artistic director,'' to indicate a higher level of responsibility.  

In the commercial world of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[New York City]] and [[West End theatre|West End]], [[London]] and touring, both nationally and internationally, producers are expected to be active members of the team, and their names appear above the show title. However, many "producers" are really [[Investment|investors]] or the theatre owner, and claim no say in running the production. A producer credit occasionally applies to people who perform special important services, such as finding a theatre or a star—but normally, the credit for such roles is ''associate producer''. The producer works closely with the production team and cast to make all final decisions. The producer, ultimately, is one of the most important roles in a theatrical production.

'''Tristan Tzara''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁistɑ̃ dzaʁa|lang}}; {{IPA-ro|trisˈtan ˈt͡sara|lang}}; born '''Samuel''' or '''Samy Rosenstock''', also known as '''S. Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1896|4 April}} &amp;ndash; 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].

After moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the "presidents of Dada", joined the staff of ''[[Littérature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[André Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].

Tristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].

==Name==
''S. Samyro'', a partial [[anagram]] of ''Samy Rosenstock'', was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"&gt;Cernat, p.108-109&lt;/ref&gt; A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature ''Tristan Ruia'', and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name ''Tristan''.&lt;ref name="pcern109"&gt;Cernat, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=15 September 2008 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=27 March 2008 }}; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the ''Tzara'' part of his pseudonym in 1915.&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the "infamous pun" ''Triste Âne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for "Sad Donkey Tzara").&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan Țara'' and ''Tr. Tzara'', in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''trist în țară'', meaning "sad in the country"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbière]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera.&lt;ref name="pcern110"&gt;Cernat, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as ''țara'' ("the land", {{IPA-ro|ˈt͡sara}}).&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Andra Matzal, [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/node/2948 "România-fantomă o să mai existe în forma unei suferințe psihice" (interview with Andrei Codrescu)]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, at [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ Club Literatura]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613075708/http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ |date=13 June 2009 }}, ''[[Cotidianul]]''; retrieved 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and ''Simbolul'' years===
Tzara was born in [[Moinești]], [[Bacău County]], in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Western Moldavia]]. His parents were [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanians]] who reportedly spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their first language;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business.&lt;ref name="iliv241"&gt;Livezeanu, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vmttcl"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Macarie, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html "Inedit: Tristan Tzara"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309001230/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, ''née'' Zibalis.&lt;ref name="vmttcl"/&gt; Owing to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]], and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;

He moved to [[Bucharest]] at the age of 11, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the [[Saint Sava National College]]&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1912, when Tzara was aged 16, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing ''[[Simbolul]]''. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds.&lt;ref name="pcern99"&gt;Cernat, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague [[Jacques G. Costin]], who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.186-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors, active within [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist movement]]. Alongside their close friend and mentor [[Adrian Maniu]] (an [[Imagism|Imagist]] who had been Vinea's tutor),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[N. Davidescu]], [[Alfred Hefter|Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]], as well as the journalist and lawyer [[Poldi Chapier]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"&gt;Cernat, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, [[Alexandru Macedonski]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; ''Simbolul'' also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and [[Iosif Iser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] of the period. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming "an interface between arts", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[Gârceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116-121&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===
Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.99, 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.&lt;ref name="pcern99"/&gt; According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was "totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Verișoară, fată de pension'' ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"/&gt;

Tzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ttunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html "Tristan Tzara"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother [[Jules Janco|Jules]], had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Zurich|local university]],&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrdada"&gt;Marta Ragozzino, "Tristan Tzara", in ''Art e Dossier'', March 1994, Giunti, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the ''[[ETH Zurich|Technische Hochschule]]'', in the Altinger Guest House&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.132; Livezeanu, p.241, 249&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French.&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"&gt;Cernat, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these pieces were first printed only in the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116, 130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Zürich that the Romanian group met with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Hugo Ball]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] poet and pianist, and his young wife [[Emmy Hennings]], a [[music hall]] performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel Słodki]], "readily agreed to take part in the cabaret."&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, "Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry&lt;!-- sic --&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"/&gt; He was soon after involved in Tzara's "simultaneist verse" performance, "the first in Zürich and in the world", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Dada===
[[File:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire retouched.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]
It was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.&lt;ref name="pcern112"&gt;Cernat, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of performances took place at the [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired."&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[André Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vaché]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: "[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for "international magazine"]."&lt;ref name="hrich14"&gt;Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: "The magazine shall be published in Zürich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich14"/&gt; The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.&lt;ref name="hrich123"&gt;Richter, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.&lt;ref name="hrich32"&gt;Richter, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of "[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for "mother" in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dadaist promoter===
Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londré, p.396; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of "an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater."&lt;ref name="bgend77"&gt;Gendron, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrich33"&gt;Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a "very cool and distant attitude to this new movement" before being approached by the Romanian author.&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''—Richter describes his "energy, passion and talent for the job", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.45, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.&lt;ref name="buddevo"&gt;S. Batchelor, "Existence, Enlightenment and Suicide: The Dilemma of Nanavira Thera", in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), ''The Buddhist Forum'', Vol. IV (Seminar Papers 1994-1996), [[Routledge]], London, 1996, p.11-13. {{ISBN|0-7286-0255-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as "fathers of Dada".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.39-40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of ''Sphinx and Strawman'', a puppet play by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], whom he advertised as an example of "Dada theater".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine.&lt;ref name="hrich167"&gt;Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in the German Empire—[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.7-8; Richter, p.102-114&lt;/ref&gt; With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137, 155, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.397; Richter, p.137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called "Dada presidents", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Théodore Fraenkel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes: "I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War I===
The shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter speaks of a "pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" (''see [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt; While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq poèmes'' ("Twenty-five Poems").&lt;ref name="rcard530"&gt;Cardinal, p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.70-74&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use "Dada" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: "Dada belongs to everybody").&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself "switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[Käthe Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.74-78&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' ("Final Dissolution"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"&gt;Richter, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who admits that the magazine was "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolts of 1918]], which "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was "an association of revolutionary artists."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.&lt;ref name="pcern115"&gt;Cernat, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183&lt;/ref&gt; When Vinea submitted his poem ''Doleanțe'' ("Grievances") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Dada===
[[File:Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret Anderson, ca. 1920s.jpg|thumb|330px|Tzara (second from right) in the 1920s, with [[Margaret C. Anderson]], [[Jane Heap]], and [[John Rodker]]]]
In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivière]] in editing the Paris-based magazine ''[[Littérature]]''.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529-530; Hofman, p.12-14; Richter, p.167, 173&lt;/ref&gt; Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an "Anti-[[Messiah]]" and a "prophet".&lt;ref name="hrich168"&gt;Richter, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt; Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt;

He is often described as the main figure in the ''Littérature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine "decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich167"/&gt; He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13-14; Richter, p.173, 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, he met American author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''", in ''The Cambridge Handbook of American Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1986 p.13. {{ISBN|0-521-30703-1}}; Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist couple [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]] (with whom he worked in tandem for "poem-dresses" and other simultaneist literary pieces).&lt;ref name="tgdelau"&gt;Tag Gronberg, "Sonia Delaunay's Simultaneous Fashions and the Modern Woman", in Whitney Chadwick, Tirza True Latimer (eds.), ''The Modern Woman Revisited: Paris between the Wars'', [[Rutgers University Press]], Piscataway, p.114-115. {{ISBN|0-8135-3292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or [[Paul Éluard]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/tzara-tristan "Tristan Tzara 1896–1963"], in Susan Salas, Laura Wisner-Broyles, ''Poetry Criticism'', Vol. 27, Gale Group Inc., 2000, [http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,&lt;ref name="bgend77"/&gt; or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Université populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"&gt;Richter, p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]].&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"/&gt;

Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Première aventure céleste de M. Antipyrine'' ("The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine").&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.179-183&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout "cra" and "cri" on a rising scale, was also performed.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary "extremism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.126-127, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada stagnation===
[[File:St-Julien-le-Pauvre &amp; houses.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 "Dada excursion"]]
By 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128; Richter, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt; According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.182-183, 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;

A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barrès]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin Péret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barrès).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-185&lt;/ref&gt; During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in Austria, at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' ("Dada in the Open Air") or ''Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol'' ("The Battle of the Singers in [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]").&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.186 (illustration 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128&lt;/ref&gt; After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned "some dramatic quarrels" between his colleague and him.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; They avoided each other for the rest of their lives and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115, 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Evola]] also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to [[esotericism]] and fascism.&lt;ref name="buddevo"/&gt;

===''Evening of the Bearded Heart''===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg kleine Dada soirée.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s poster for a Dada soirée (ca.1923)]]
Tzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for ''[[Le Journal de Peuple]]'', where the Romanian writer was denounced as "an impostor" avid for "publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114; Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Breton initiated the ''Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit''. The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and [[Christian Schad]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"&gt;Cernat, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists.&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Rumors reported much later by American writer [[Brion Gysin]] had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the [[Prefecture of Police]].&lt;ref name="nzgysin"&gt;[[Nicholas Zurbrugg]], "Brion Gysin", in ''Art, Performance, Media: 31 Interviews'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], Minneapolis, p.190. {{ISBN|0-8166-3832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in [[Weimar]], where the Dadaists attended a festival of the [[Bauhaus]] art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: "Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Bearded Heart" manifesto a number of artists backed the marginalization of Breton in support of Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Éluard, the pro-Tzara faction included [[Erik Satie]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Serge Charchoune]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Ilia Zdanevich]], and [[Man Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; During an associated soirée, ''Evening of the Bearded Heart'', which began on 6 July 1923, Tzara presented a re-staging of his play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (which had been first performed two years earlier to howls of derision from its audience), for which [[Sonia Delaunay]] designed the costumes.&lt;ref name="tgdelau"/&gt; Breton interrupted its performance and reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, prompting a theatre riot that only the intervention of the police halted.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Dada's vaudeville declined in importance and disappeared altogether after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Picabia took Breton's side against Tzara,&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.15; Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the staff of his ''391'', enlisting collaborations from [[Clément Pansaers]] and [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. Richter suggests that "Surrealism devoured and digested Dada."&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"/&gt; Tzara distanced himself from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, increasingly, with its politics.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists collaborated with Richter and the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] artist [[El Lissitzky]] on the magazine ''G'',&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; and, the following year, he wrote pieces for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-[[Slovenia]]n magazine ''Tank'' (edited by [[Ferdinand Delak]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to Surrealism===
[[File:Paris 18 - Maison Tristan Tzara -1.JPG|thumb|230px|''Maison Tzara'', designed by [[Adolf Loos]]]]
Tzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', which was soon included in the repertoire of [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Garafola, ''Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance'', [[Wesleyan University Press]], Middletown, 2005, p.172. {{ISBN|0-8195-6674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the ''Seven Dada Manifestos''. [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Henri Lefebvre]] reviewed them enthusiastically; he later became one of the author's friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: the Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1984, p.293 {{ISBN|0-520-05742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by ''Contimporanul'', which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the "new art demonstration" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 156, 159, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the short-lived magazine ''Integral'', where [[Ilarie Voronca]] and [[Ion Călugăru]] were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240, 277, 279, 287&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1927 interview with the publication, he voiced his opposition to the Surrealist group's adoption of communism, indicating that such politics could only result in a "new bourgeoisie" being created, and explaining that he had opted for a personal "[[permanent revolution]]", which would preserve "the holiness of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in [[Stockholm]], where he married [[Greta Knutson]], with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927).&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; A former student of painter [[André Lhote]], she was known for her interest in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[abstract art]].&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"&gt;"Greta Knutson", in [[Penelope Rosemont]], ''[[Surrealist Women]]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London &amp; New York, 1998, p.69. {{ISBN|0-485-30088-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]], a former representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; The rigidly [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] ''Maison Tristan Tzara'', built in [[Montmartre]], was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of [[African art]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

In 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; The same year, he issued the poetry book ''De nos oiseaux'' ("Of Our Birds").&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; This period saw the publication of ''[[The Approximate Man]]'' (1931), alongside the volumes ''L'Arbre des voyageurs'' ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), ''Où boivent les loups'' ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), ''L'Antitête'' ("The Antihead", 1933) and ''Grains et issues'' ("Seed and Bran", 1935).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay.&lt;ref name="pcern277"&gt;Cernat, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of ''Le Cœur à barbe'', starring Breton and other leading Surrealists.&lt;ref name="ttzimdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0879262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he signed his name to ''The Testimony against [[Gertrude Stein]]'', published by [[Eugene Jolas]]'s magazine ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' in reply to Stein's memoir ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;!-- sic --&gt; in which he accused his former friend of being a [[megalomania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet became involved in further developing [[Surrealist techniques]], and, together with Breton and [[Valentine Hugo]], drew one of the better-known examples of "[[exquisite corpse]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Biberi]], ''Arta suprarealistă'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1973, p.53. {{OCLC|22905196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend [[René Char]], and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]].&lt;ref&gt;"René Char Bio-Bibliography", in ''Selected Poems of René Char'' (edited by [[Mary Ann Caws]] and Tina Jolas), [[New Directions Publishers]], New York, 1992, p.xii. {{ISBN|0-8112-1191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt; This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt;

At home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter [[Sașa Pană]], who corresponded with him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 106, 109, 116; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"/&gt; In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend [[Jacques G. Costin]], a ''Contimporanul'' affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with communism and Spanish Civil War===

Alarmed by the establishment of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of [[anti-fascism]], and was close to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by [[Kurt Schwitters]] in [[Hanover]], works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, [[ration stamp]] with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he briefly left France and joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.245-246&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] reporter [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Tzara visited [[Madrid]], which was besieged by the [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]] (''see [[Siege of Madrid]]'').&lt;ref name="iliv246"&gt;Livezeanu, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he published the collection of poems ''Midis gagnés'' ("Conquered Southern Regions").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure ''Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol'' ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, [[Nancy Cunard]] and the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Robin Suleiman, "Committed Painting", in Denis Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 1994, p.938. {{ISBN|0-674-61566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, ''Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure'', Timewell Press, London, 2005, p.221. {{ISBN|1-85725-211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Weber, "Nancy Cunard: a Troubled Heiress with an Ideological Mission", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the poet was moving away from Surrealism,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; his adherence to strict [[Marxism-Leninism]] was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="pbeit49"&gt;Beitchman, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of [[Utopia]], which combined communist messages with [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[psychoanalysis]] and made use of particularly violent imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the [[party line (politics)|party line]], maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.&lt;ref name="spbuot"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Pop, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/*articleID_9669-articles_details.html "François Buot, Tristan Tzara. Omul care a pus la cale revoluția Dada"] (book review), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 195, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer [[René Crevel]], organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist [[Salvador Dalí]], who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of [[William Tell]] had alarmed them because it shared likeness with [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Rojas, ''Salvador Dalí, or the Art of Spitting on Your Mother's Portrait'', [[Penn State University Press]], University Park, 1993, p.98. {{ISBN|0-271-00842-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] notes that Tzara, who agreed with [[Stalinism]] and shunned [[Trotskyism]], submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="iliv251"&gt;Livezeanu, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.247-249&lt;/ref&gt; This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt;

===World War II and Resistance===
During [[World War II]], Tzara took refuge from the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation forces]], moving to the southern areas, controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; On one occasion, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] publication ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' made his whereabouts known to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.marianne2.fr/Tristan-Tzara,-radical,-mondain-et-anticonformiste_a41229.html?PHPSESSID=c3682e2fb29f923d2fc35498af3a6907 "Tristan Tzara, radical, mondain et anticonformiste"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'', 13 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in [[Marseille]] in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat [[Varian Fry]], were seeking to escape [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. Among the people present there were the anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] socialist [[Victor Serge]], anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], playwright [[Arthur Adamov]], philosopher and poet [[René Daumal]], and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and [[Benjamin Péret]], as well as artists [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Victor Brauner]] and [[Óscar Domínguez]].&lt;ref name="dgmarse"&gt;Danièle Giraudy, Musée de Marseille (eds.), ''Le jeu de Marseille: autour d'André Breton et des surréalistes à Marseille en 1940-1941'', Éditions Alors Hors du Temps, Marseille, p.79sqq&lt;/ref&gt; During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new [[card game]], on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.&lt;ref name="dgmarse"/&gt;

Some time after his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the [[French Resistance]], rallying with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. A contributor to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the [[Free French Forces]] clandestine radio station.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He lived in [[Aix-en-Provence]], then in [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]], and ultimately in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]''.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-allied and antisemitic Romania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], "The Romanian Press: Preparing the Ground for the Holocaust and Reporting on Its Implementation", in Robert Moses Shapiro, ''Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and International Journalism during the Holocaust'', Ktav, Hoboken, 2003, p.404. {{ISBN|0-88125-775-3}}; {{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-175. {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23639 "Destinul excepțional al lui Alexandru Șafran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 523, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, five months after the [[Liberation of Paris]], he was contributing to ''[[L'Éternelle Revue]]'', a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control.&lt;ref name="srsmemor"&gt;Susan Rubin Suleiman, ''Crises of Memory and the Second World War'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.30-31. {{ISBN|0-674-02206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, [[Elsa Triolet]], [[Eugène Guillevic]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Jacques Prévert]] and painter [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref name="srsmemor"/&gt;

Upon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; During 1945, under the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt; According to Livezeanu, he "helped reclaim the [[Southern France|South]] from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France]."&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt; In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, Éluard, Aragon and Dalí, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on [[Radio in Paris|Parisian Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drop Everything, Drop Dado", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1946&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; (according to some sources, he had been one since 1934).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===International leftism===
Over the following decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in [[primitivism]], he became a critic of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]'s [[French colonial empires|colonial policy]], and joined his voice to those who supported [[decolonization]].&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was appointed [[cultural ambassador]] of the Republic by the [[Paul Ramadier]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.244, 246, 247&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

He returned to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113; Livezeanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"&gt;{{ro icon}} János Farkas, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=154 "Tristan Tzara în Ungaria.

In 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate [[Nazım Hikmet]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' for the pro-Soviet public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmusic"&gt;Mark Carroll, ''Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.52. {{ISBN|0-521-82072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by [[Louis Durey]] and [[Serge Nigg]]).&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt; Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

His works of the period include, among others: ''Le Signe de vie'' ("Sign of Life", 1946), ''Terre sur terre'' ("Earth on Earth", 1946), ''Sans coup férir'' ("Without a Need to Fight", 1949), ''De mémoire d'homme'' ("From a Man's Memory", 1950), ''Parler seul'' ("Speaking Alone", 1950), and ''La Face intérieure'' ("The Inner Face", 1953), followed in 1955 by ''À haute flamme'' ("Flame out Loud") and ''Le Temps naissant'' ("The Nascent Time"), and the 1956 ''Le Fruit permis'' ("The Permitted Fruit").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imjbokks"&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/dada_surrealism/pdf/books%20from%20schwarz%20catalog-3.pdf ''Books in the Vera and Arturo Schwarz Collection''], at the [[Israel Museum]]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara continued to be an active promoter of modernist culture. Around 1949, having read [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Samuel Beckett]]'s manuscript of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Tzara facilitated the play's staging by approaching producer [[Roger Blin]].&lt;ref name="dbgodot"&gt;[[David Bradby]], ''Beckett: Waiting for Godot'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2001, p.46. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into French some poems by Hikmet&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vargaftig (ed.), ''Poésies de Résistence'', J'ai lu, Paris, 1994. {{ISBN|2-277-23767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hungarian author [[Attila József]].&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; In 1949, he introduced Picasso to art dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]] (thus helping start their lifelong partnership),&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding
"Obituary: Heinz Berggruen, Noted Art Dealer and Collector", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1951, wrote the catalog for an exhibit of works by his friend [[Max Ernst]]; the text celebrated the artist's "free use of stimuli" and "his discovery of a new kind of humor."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 protest and final years===
[[File:Tristan Tzara grave.jpg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
In October 1956, Tzara visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illyés]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[László Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]]).&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kassák]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement "revolutionary".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as "an abstract notion".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of "[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On 24 October, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did.&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as "the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet [[François Villon]],&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], to promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of the Nihilists", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1957&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, one year after the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] had been established by [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (''see [[Algerian War]]''). Together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Jérôme Lindon]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and other intellectuals, he addressed [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Michel Debré]] a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence.&lt;ref name="laduras"&gt;[[Laure Adler]], ''Marguerite Duras: A Life'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2000, p.233-234. {{ISBN|0-226-00758-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[André Malraux]] announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|French Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="laduras"/&gt;

In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the [[International Congress on African Culture]], organized by English curator [[Frank McEwen]] and held at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], ''Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent'', [[Jacana Media]], 2007, p.227. {{ISBN|1-77009-363-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

==Literary contributions==

===Identity issues===
Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" was stimulated by "young emancipated Jewish writers."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt; while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s."&lt;ref name="gcal887"&gt;Călinescu, p.887&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zuntfhaus zür Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moară la Hârța'' ("At the Mill in Hârța") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.182, 405&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by "the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants".&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt;

Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a "modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]" means of breaking with "the peripheral condition",&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; According to the same author, two important elements in this process were "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an "[[Oedipus complex]]" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.398, 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Zürich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates."&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as "Orientals".&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a "[[Italic peoples|Latin]]" temperament.&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of "[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was "a barbarian".&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114, 115; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of "literary anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his "formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the "[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit", of the "foreign plague" and of "[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], Bucharest, 1995, p.457. {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist poetry===
Tzara's earliest [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist poems]], published in ''Simbolul'' during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked [[Sașa Pană]] not to include them in editions of his works.&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]].&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to Symbolist [[musicality]] at that stage, he was indebted to his ''Simbolul'' colleague [[Ion Minulescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49; Emil Manu, "Actualitatea lui Ion Minulescu", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Versuri și proză'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1986, p.8. {{OCLC|18090790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belgian [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; Philip Beitchman argues that "Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the "hanged man" motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se spânzură un om'' ("A Man Hangs Himself"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].&lt;ref name="pcern52"&gt;Cernat, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Se spânzură un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Ballad") and Vinea (''Visul spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Dream"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective.&lt;ref name="pcern52"/&gt; These pieces also include ''Vacanță în provincie'' ("Provincial Holiday") and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' ("The Storm and the Deserter's Song"), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt; The series is seen by Cernat as "the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, "since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"&gt;Beitchman, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat notes: "That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]].&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.38-39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, "the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Vinea===
The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109, 119, 160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being "meditative and melancholic", while Tzara's is "[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]".&lt;ref name="pcern117"&gt;Cernat, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117-119&lt;/ref&gt; His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|să ne coborâm în râpa, 
care-i Dumnezeu când cască}}&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
|
let's descend into the precipice
that is God yawning}}

In his ''Înserează'' (roughly, "Night Falling"), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|[...] deschide-te fereastră, prin urmare
și ieși noapte din odaie ca din piersică sâmburul, 
ca preotul din biserică
[...] hai în parcul communal
până o cânta cocoșul
să se scandalizeze orașul [...].}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
[...] open yourself therefore, window
and you night, spring out of the room like a kernel from the peach,
like a priest from the church
[...] let's go to the community park
before the rooster starts crowing
so that the city will be scandalized [...]}}

Vinea's similar poem, written in [[Tuzla, Constanța|Tuzla]] and named after that village, reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|seara bate semne pe far
peste goarnele vagi de apă
când se întorc pescarii cu stele pe mâini
și trec vapoarele și planetele}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
the evening stamps signs on the lighthouse
over the vague bugles of water
when fishermen return with stars on their arms
and ships and planets pass by}}

Cernat notes that ''Nocturnă'' ("Nocturne") and ''Înserează'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as "Rumanian poetry",&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse,&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dennis Deletant]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-01-12&amp;art=3373 "Întoarcerea României în Europa: între politică și cultură"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021120445/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3373&amp;nr=2007-01-12 |date=21 October 2007 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 879, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's diary entry of 5 February 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still "conservative in style".&lt;ref name="hrich16"&gt;Richter, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that "bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness."&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: "As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...]."&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;

Alongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves "crawl like worms" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees "heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals", or wind wailing "with all the hopelessness of an orphanage",&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Samyro's poetry includes ''Verișoară, fată de pension'', which, Cernat argues, displays "playful detachment [for] the musicality of [[internal rhyme]]s".&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; It opens with the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Verișoară, fată de pension, îmbrăcată în negru, guler alb,
Te iubesc pentru că ești simplă și visezi
Și ești bună, plângi, și rupi scrisori ce nu au înțeles
Și-ți pare rău că ești departe de ai tăi și că înveți 
La Călugărițe unde noaptea nu e cald.}}&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;
|
Little cousin, boarding school girl, dressed in black, white collar,
I love you because you are simple and you dream
And you are kind, you cry, you tear up letters that have no meaning
And you feel bad because you are far from yours and you study
At the Nuns where at night it's not warm.}}

The [[Gârceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of "pure poetry", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Valéry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 288; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.62-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada synthesis and "simultaneism"===
Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396; Richter, p.19, 191 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.216-217)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; and Marinetti.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and [[black comedy]] writings of Romania's [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128-129, 341, 343, 346; Amy D. Colin, "Paul Celan's Poetics of Destruction", in Amy D. Colin (ed.), ''Argumentum E Silentio'', [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 1987, p.158. {{ISBN|3-11-010555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[Māori language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by "heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's "simultaneist poetry", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was "the value of the human voice."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer'' ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;

Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by "extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396-397&lt;/ref&gt; had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.887; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rlword"&gt;Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs'', [[University of Illinois Press]], Urbana &amp; Chicago, p.45. {{ISBN|0-252-01413-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and anti-art===
The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected "the language of a sophisticated savage".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for "compress[ing] what we think and feel",&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Hans Richter, the genre "suited Tzara perfectly."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: "Dada means nothing", adding "Thought is produced in the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; In addition, Tzara, who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X. Uranus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074348/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 96, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably approved of Serner's vision of a "final dissolution".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.48, 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"/&gt;

Despite adopting such [[anti-art]]istic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of "furthening the cause of art."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"&gt;Richter, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem "as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers", which included the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire Calligramme.JPG|thumb|190px|One of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s [[calligram]]s, shaped like the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]
''La Revue Dada 2'', which also includes the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] line ''tralalalalalalalalalalala'', is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"/&gt; This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that "Man is in search of a new language."&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"&gt;Mary Lewis Shaw, "Concrete and Abstract Poetry: The World as Text and the Text as World", in Leonard M. Trawick (ed.), ''World, Self, Poem: Essays on Contemporary Poetry from the "Jubliation of Poets"'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1990, p.169. {{ISBN|0-87338-419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to "shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]".&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt;

The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage'' ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the "skinny, idiotic, dirty" reader who "does not understand my poetry."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.530; Hofman, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became "destruction of the word for nothing".&lt;ref name="dwslettr"&gt;David W. Seaman, "French Lettrisme—Discontinuity and the Nature of the Avant-Garde", in Freeman G. Henry (ed.), ''Discontinuity and Fragmentation'', [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]], Amsterdam, 1994, p.163. {{ISBN|90-5183-634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an "internal order", and read as "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===Plays of the 1920s===
Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[The Gas Heart]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what Enoch Brater calls a "peculiar verbal strategy", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.&lt;ref name="ebra25"&gt;Brater, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.&lt;ref name="ebra25"/&gt; The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words.&lt;ref name="ebra26"&gt;Brater, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a "parod[y] of theatrical conventions".&lt;ref name="ebra26"/&gt;

In his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on "the relativity of things, sentiments and events."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a "privileged position for art": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his "most beloved" writers and a "great poet", argued: "''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater."&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion Călugăru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.&lt;ref name="pcern277"/&gt;

===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===
After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from "a studied inconsequentiality" and "unreadable gibberish" to "a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The critic also remarks: "Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with "suffering", had discovered humanity, and had become a "[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]" among poets.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-42&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal calls the piece "an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty",&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the "excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.40-45&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals in the text reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul
je ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi
un bruit glacé froissé au carrefour jeté sur le trottoir humide
aux pieds des hommes pressés courant avec leurs morts
autour de la mort qui étend ses bras
sur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;
|
I speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone
I am but a small noise I have several noises in me
a ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement
with the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead
around death which extends its arms
on the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}

The next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbeit49"/&gt; The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as "fascinating",&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''The Approximate Man'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.46-50&lt;/ref&gt; People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal notes: "In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[François Villon]], whom he deeply admired.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Influence===
Beside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by ''[[unu]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; magazine, written by [[Sașa Pană]] and [[Moldov]], cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as artists [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.889&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was [[Jacques G. Costin]], who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and [[Futurism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.174, 193, 409&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ilarie Voronca]]'s ''Zodiac'' cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to ''The Approximate Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and Surrealist author [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art.&lt;ref name="ipuranus"/&gt; Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were [[Poland|Polish]] Futurist writer [[Bruno Jasieński]],&lt;ref&gt;Nina Kolesnikoff, ''Bruno Jasieński: His Evolution from Futurism to Socialist Realism'', [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], Waterloo, 1982, p.15. {{ISBN|0-88920-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese poet and [[Zen]] thinker [[Takahashi Shinkichi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Makoto Ueda (poetry critic)|Makoto Ueda]], ''Modern Japanese Poets and the Nature of Literature'', [[Stanford University Press]], Palo Alto, 1983, p.335-336. {{ISBN|0-8047-1166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chile]]an poet and Dadaist sympathizer [[Vicente Huidobro]], who cited him as a precursor for his own ''[[Creacionismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Vicente Huidobro]], [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/manifiesto1.htm ''El Creacionismo''], at the [[University of Chile]] [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ Vicente Huidobro site]; retrieved 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate precursor of [[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdism]], he was acknowledged as a mentor by [[Eugène Ionesco]], who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont, ''Ionesco's Imperatives: The Politics of Culture'', [[University of Michigan Press]], Ann Arbor, 1993, p.4. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's poetry influenced [[Samuel Beckett]] (who translated some of it into English);&lt;ref name="dbgodot"/&gt; the Irish author's 1972 play ''[[Not I]]'' shares some elements with ''[[The Gas Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brater, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Romanian author is cited as an influence on [[Beat Generation]] members. Beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]], who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;Josef Jařab, "When All Met Together in One Room: Josef Jařab Interviews Allen Ginsberg", in Heather Hathaway, Josef Jařab, Jeffrey Melnick (eds.), ''Race and the Modern Artist'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, p.242-243. {{ISBN|0-19-512324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the [[cut-up technique]], adopted by [[Brion Gysin]] and Burroughs himself.&lt;ref name="rlword"/&gt; Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were "going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a "Communist Party bureaucrat".&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;

Among the late 20th-century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are [[Jerome Rothenberg]],&lt;ref name="camroth"&gt;Christine A. Meilick, ''Jerome Rothenberg's Experimental Poetry and Jewish Tradition'', [[Lehigh University Press]], Bethlehem, 2005, p.46-47, 85sqq. {{ISBN|0-934223-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore Isou]] and [[Andrei Codrescu]]. The former [[Situationist International|Situationist]] Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come in succession to Apollinaire and Dada,&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"/&gt; declared his [[Lettrism]] to be the last connection in the [[Charles Baudelaire]]-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging "a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote."&lt;ref name="dwslettr"/&gt; For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noemi Marin, "The Rhetoric of Andrei Codrescu: A Reading in Exilic Fragmentation", in Domnica Rădulescu (ed.), ''Realms of Exile: Nomadism, Diasporas, and Eastern European Voices'', Lexington Books, New York, p.102. {{ISBN|0-7391-0333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled the impact of having discovered Tzara's work in his youth, and credited him with being "the most important French poet after Rimbaud."&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;

In retrospect, various authors describe Tzara's Dadaist shows and street performances as "[[happening]]s", with a word employed by post-Dadaists and Situationists, which was coined in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.44; Londré, p.397&lt;/ref&gt; Some also credit Tzara with having provided an ideological source for the development of [[rock music]], including [[punk rock]], [[punk subculture]] and [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.36; Thomas McLaughlin, ''Street Smarts and Critical Theory: Listening to the Vernacular'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, 1997, p.67. {{ISBN|0-299-15170-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristan Tzara has inspired the songwriting technique of [[Radiohead]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Tate, ''The Music and Art of Radiohead'', [[Ashgate Publishing]], London etc., 2005, p.195. {{ISBN|0-7546-3980-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the avant-garde authors whose voices were mixed by [[DJ Spooky]] on his [[trip hop]] album ''Rhythm Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Buttimer, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/jx8c/ "DJ Spooky.

===Tributes and portrayals===
[[File:Tzara by Tihanyi.jpg|thumb|210px|1927, Portrait of Tzara by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]]]
In France, Tzara's work was collected as ''Oeuvres complètes'' ("Complete Works"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; and an international poetry award is named after him (''Prix International de Poésie Tristan Tzara'').

According to Paul Cernat, ''Aliluia'', one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a "transparent allusion" to Tristan Tzara.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's fragment speaks of "the [[Wandering Jew]]", a character whom people notice because he sings ''La moară la Hârța'', "a suspicious song from [[Greater Romania]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181-182&lt;/ref&gt; The poet is a character in [[India]]n novelist [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s ''Thieves of Fire'', part four of his ''The Bubble'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Chandra, ''Fresh Perspectives on Fiction'', Anmol Publications, New Delhi, 2005, p.78. {{ISBN|81-261-2126-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''The Prince of West End Avenue'', a 1994 book by the American [[Alan Isler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bette Pesetsky]], "Shakespeare Meets Emma Lazarus", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg dedicated several of his poems to Tzara,&lt;ref name="camroth"/&gt; as did the [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[Valery Oișteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Valery Oișteanu]], [http://www.respiro.org/Issue10/poezie_oisteanu.htm "Poeme din exil"] in [http://www.respiro.org/ ''Respiro''], Issue 10/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with [[Gertrude Stein]]'s controversial memoir.

At some point between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is believed to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J.

Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. [[Max Ernst]] depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait ''Au Rendez-vous des Amis'' ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922),&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; while, in one of [[Man Ray]]'s photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an [[androgynous]] [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Moynagh, introduction to [[Nancy Cunard]], ''Essays on Race and Empire'', Broadview Press, Peterborough &amp; Orchard Park, p.24. {{ISBN|1-55111-230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before their split, [[Francis Picabia]] used Tzara's [[Calligraphy|calligraphed]] name in ''Moléculaire'' ("Molecular"), a composition printed on the cover of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alberto Giacometti]] made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bnf.fr/PAGES/presse/dossiers/giacometti.pdf ''Dossier de presse.

===Posthumous controversies===
The many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by "petty jealousies".&lt;ref name="hrich32"/&gt; In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[Gârceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] argued that "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a "[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]".&lt;ref name="pcern113"&gt;Cernat, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an "illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon", and denounced him as "the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature."&lt;ref name="pcern113"/&gt; Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as "Dr. Barbu", a thick-hided charlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sanda Cordoș, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html "''Lunatecii'' – un mare roman de redescoperit"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to "[[protochronism]]", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of "Romanian initiatives" and "road openers at a universal level."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.359&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''vagina and vulva have been depicted in art''' from [[prehistoric art|prehistory]] to the [[contemporary art]] era of the 21st century. [[Visual art]] forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted [[Venus figurine]]s that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or [[vulva]].

In 1866, [[Gustave Courbet]] painted a picture of a nude woman which depicted the female genitals, entitled "[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]". In the 20th and 21st century, artists such as [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Megumi Igarashi]] and [[Anish Kapoor]] have created artworks that depict the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]]. Sometimes these are explicitly works of [[feminist art]]: [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' to celebrate 39 women of history and myth, many of whom had fallen into obscurity. Other artists deny that their works reference the vulva or vagina, although critics view them as such; the flower paintings of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] are a case in point.

There have long been folklore traditions, such as the ''[[vagina loquens]]'' ("talking vagina") and the ''[[vagina dentata]]'' ("toothed vagina"). Playwright [[Eve Ensler]] wrote the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'', a popular stage work about many aspects of [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]]. In some cases, vagina- or vulva-themed art has attracted controversy and led to legal issues or official [[censorship]] pertaining to perceptions of [[obscenity]].

Some cultures view the [[vulva]] as something shameful that should be hidden. For example, the term ''pudendum'', the Latin term used in medical English for the external genitalia, literally means "shameful thing".

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] sculpture, which is at least 35,000 years old, is the oldest example of a vulva in art.]]

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the vulva, i.e. paintings and [[figurine]]s, exist from tens of millennia ago.  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

The [[cave of Chufín]] located in the town of Riclones in [[Cantabria]] ([[Spain]]) has prehistoric rock art which may be a depiction of the vulva. The cave was occupied at different periods, the oldest being around 20,000 years ago. Aside from schematic engravings and paintings of animals, there are also many symbols, such as a those known as "sticks". There is also a large number of drawings using points (''puntillaje''), including one which has been interpreted as a representation of a vulva.

A [[Venus figurine]] is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] statuette portraying a woman. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia. Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (28,000–22,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].

These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, over a hundred such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 4&amp;nbsp;cm and 25&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.

===11th and 12th century===
[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 12th century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[Sheela na gig]]s are 11th and 12th century figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated vulva. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found on churches, castles, and other buildings, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain, sometimes together with male figures. One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland. There is a replica of the round tower sheela na gig in the county museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

Such carvings are said to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other grotesques, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away through the use of [[apotropaic magic]]. They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

Weir and Jerman argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female lust as hideous and sinfully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian fertility or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J.

===Folklore traditions===
The [[vagina loquens]], or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to ancient [[Motif (folkloristics)|folklore motifs]].&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|author=Vance Randolph, Gershon Legman |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S93LdPw2KP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1557282374|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Slavoj Zizek |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415969212|page=173|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt;

Another folk tale concerns the [[vagina dentata]] ("toothed vagina"). The implication of these tales is that sexual intercourse might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. These stories were frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage rape.&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;{{cite book| isbn = 978-0-312-64436-9| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2ybaNhKqGmwC&amp;pg=PA59| title       = What's Up Down There?: Questions You'd Only Ask Your Gynecologist If She Was Your Best Friend| publisher  = [[St. Martin's Press]]| date = 2010| accessdate = 2012-02-11| quote = | page= 59| author = Rankin, Lissa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art===
[[File:Blue-green.jpg|thumb|right|upright|While [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]'s paintings have been interpreted by some modern feminist artists as stylized depictions of the vulva, O'Keeffe herself consistently denied these Freudian interpretations of her paintings (pictured is "Blue and Green Music", 1921).]]

In 1966, the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] collaborated with [[Dadaist]] artist [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[:sv:Per Olof Ultvedt|Per Olof Ultvedt]] on a large sculpture installation entitled "hon-en katedral" (also spelled "Hon-en-Katedrall", which means "she-a cathedral") for Moderna Museet, in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The outer form is a giant reclining sculpture of a woman with her legs spread. Museum patrons can go inside her body by entering a door-sized vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikidesaintphalle.org/niki-de-saint-phalle/biography/#1965-1969 "Biography - 1965-69"], Niki de Saint Phalle Foundation, Retrieved 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Phalle stated that the sculpture represented a [[fertility goddess]] who was able to receive visitors into her body and then "give birth" to them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/4436238/_In_sorrow_she_created_delight_An_Appeal_for_a_Greater_Appraisal_of_the_Life_and_Art_of_Niki_de_Saint_Phalle |title="In sorrow, she created delight": An Appeal for a Greater Appraisal of the Life and Art of Niki de Saint Phalle |last1=Tripp |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |date=  |page=10 |website=www.academia.edu|publisher=Academia |access-date=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside her body is a screen showing [[Greta Garbo]] films, a goldfish pond and a soft drink vending machine.

From 1974 to 1979, [[Judy Chicago]], a [[feminist art]]ist, created the vulva-themed [[installation art]]work "[[The Dinner Party]]". It consists of 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora of Byzantium]] are among those honoured. Each plate, except the one corresponding to Sojourner Truth (a Black woman), depicts a brightly-colored, elaborately styled butterfly-vulva form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum: Place Settings|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings/|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was produced, despite resistance from the art world, it toured to 16 venues in six countries to a viewing audience of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Maura|title=founding curator|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/tour_and_home.php|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art|the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York. Chicago gave [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] a prominent place in ''The Dinner Party'', because some modern feminists believe that O'Keeffe's detailed flower paintings such as ''Black Iris III'' (1926) evoke a veiled representation of female genitalia. O'Keeffe consistently denied the validity these Freudian interpretations of her art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/166103/Georgia_OKeeffe_Place_Setting/ |title=Georgia O'Keeffe Place Setting |publisher=[[Brooklyn Museum]] |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artistic representation of the vagina coincides with 18th century anatomical dissection and identification of the genitalia (i.e., [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paola Uparella Carlos A.

''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', a 1996 episodic play by [[Eve Ensler]], has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, [[rape]], menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ensler, Eve (2001).
