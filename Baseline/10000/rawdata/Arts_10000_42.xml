The '''62 Group of Textile Artists''' is an international group of professional textile artists founded in the United Kingdom in 1962.:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Coatts, M 1998, '62 group: the language of touch', /Crafts (0306610X)/, 150, pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; The group is a Constituted Artists [[Co-operative]], focussed on exhibiting the work of its members in the UK and overseas. Membership of the group is achieved through a selection process. The 62 Group requires members to submit work to a selection panel of their peers for every exhibition "If members fail to submit, or are rejected for three successive exhibitions, then membership is forfeited...a policy which ensures that the group consistently produces exciting work."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, J 2009, 'Breaking not bending‚At the limits of art', /Crafts (0306610X)/, 220, pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt; The increased profile of textile art and its evolution in the latter part of the 20th century "has to a great extent been dictated by members of the 62 Group."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, P 1998, 'Submerging stitches‚Äîemerging ideas: the 62 Group has paved the road for contemporary textile art in Great Britain', /Fiberarts/, 25, 3, pp. 48–52, Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCO/host/, viewed 21 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objectives&lt;ref&gt;62 Group Constitution: agreed AGM December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of the group are:
* To promote Textile Art in major national and international venues
* To provide facilities for its members to exhibit and sell their work
* To create opportunities for the growth and exchange of ideas
* To encourage the exploration of new directions
* To encourage links with international textile groups
* To promote and encourage greater awareness of textile art through education

==History==

Founding members Alison Erridge (nee Liley), Jennifer Gray and Joy Clucas invited a group of [[embroidery]] teachers to attend a meeting at [[Embroiderers' Guild|The Embroiderers' Guild]] in London in November 1962&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Beaney, Maries &amp; Walker in Millar, L. (ed.) (2011) Radical Thread. The 62 Group 1962-2012. Tunbridge Wells: Direct Design Books&lt;/ref&gt;. They were concerned about the limited professional opportunities available to embroidery graduates at the time. Contemporary embroidery was hard to find and there was little written about it&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Leonard, P 1998, 'Submerging stitches—emerging ideas: the 62 Group has paved the road for contemporary textile art in Great Britain', Fiberarts, 25, 3, pp. 48–52, Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost, viewed 21 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. The first meeting brought together people from a wide range of backgrounds. Embroidery graduates were frustrated because galleries would not take work "if they thought it was a woman's hobby"&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Walker, A. (2004) National Life Stories Collection: Crafts Lives, Walker Audrey (8 of 15) http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Crafts/021M-C0960X0030XX-0008V0 [Accessed: 21 Jan 2018] &lt;/ref&gt; The 62 Group "came really up out of several students from colleges determined to get it [embroidery] shown"&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The meeting also included Audrey Tucker, Pat Scrase, Judy Barry and Marie Shawcross&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;. This meeting created a formal link with the Embroiderers' Guild and at this point, any embroiderer could become a member&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;. Early in the group's existence (1964–65), members realised that the open membership created problems with the quality and consistency of work submitted for exhibitions. It was around this time that selection for membership and exhibitions was instigated and became a fundamental principle of the constitution. This shift also brought about a change to the group's title, as they became 'The Professional Group of the Embroiderers' Guild'&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;.

The first exhibition was remembered by Audrey Walker MBE "It consisted mostly of small framed panels but the quality of the drawing, design and the subject matter was really remarkable"&lt;ref&gt;Walker in Millar, L. (ed.) (2011) Radical Thread. The 62 Group 1962-2012. Tunbridge Wells: Direct Design Books&lt;/ref&gt;
Walker reflects 'I thought, this is amazing. Why don't I know about this?' By 1965, she had joined the 62 Group and was exhibiting.'Jan Beaney was terrific, she insisted I joined. It was wonderful to have the
support of this group. To share a passion.'&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P 1997, 'Sources of inspiration', /Crafts (0306610X)/, 145, pp. 42–45, &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Group was then sponsored by the Art Exhibitions Bureau, an organisation which toured exhibitions throughout the UK. This enabled the group to reach a wider public and to make sales of artwork. The increased pressure to produce artwork became a problem and so touring finished after two years. &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;. Following this the group were successful in securing exhibitions at prestigious London venues including [[Royal Festival Hall|The Royal Festival Hall]] (1967), [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] (1970 and 1972), [[Commonwealth Institute|the Commonwealth Institute]] (1972) and TUC [[Congress House]] (1970 and 1972). This period helped to establish a regular programme of exhibitions for the group.

Twenty years after the group was first founded members recognised that the term 'embroidery' was limiting to the scope of the group and the decision was made to open membership to artists of any textile discipline. Formal ties with the Embroiderers' Guild were severed and the group was renamed 'The 62 Group of Textile Artists'&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;. A 1997 review of The 62 Group exhibition 'The Language of Touch' questions if, after broadening the range of textiles disciplines, "one wonders if it is not also too diverse. Does the backbone of embroiderers and stitchers wish to be faced with competition from, for example, classic tapestry weavers? It is not absolutely clear where the group will go from here."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; An article in Fibrearts mentions the same exhibition and comments that "The extraction of old ideas and injection of new ideas were of benefit. The result was a leaner, stronger body of work than had been seen before. The avant-garde was made up of new members."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Throughout the 62 Group's history, many members have been teachers, lecturers and academics, influencing the future of textile art through their support for textiles in arts education "we have had a major influence in expanding the acceptance of experimental textiles into the general curriculum in schools, colleges and universities". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.textileartist.org/the-62-group-of-textile-artists-jae-maries/|title=Spotlight: 62 Group of Textile Artists by Jae Maries - TextileArtist.org|date=14 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups members have also contributed extensively to publishing about contemporary textiles in journals such as World of Embroidery (now Embroidery) and Crafts and have also published seminal books on the subject&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;.

==Exhibitions==
Between 1963 and 2011 The 62 Group held 85 exhibitions, mainly in the UK but also in Japan, Israel and Netherlands.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The group usually has at least one exhibition per year.

==Members==

Membership of The 62 Group is by selection. Potential new members apply to the group with examples of their work, and a committee of existing members chooses whether to accept the applicants on the basis of the selection criteria. The membership changes each year as new members join and others leave but usually remains fairly consistent at around 50 exhibiting members.&lt;ref&gt;The 62 Group of Textile Artists http://www.62group.org.uk/about/ Accessed 20 Jan 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  While the group was originally established in the UK, membership is now international with members in the Netherlands, Hungary, South Africa and Japan.&lt;br&gt;

'''''Aegyo''''' ({{korean|hangul=애교|hanja=愛嬌}}) in [[Korean language|Korean]] refers to a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.&lt;ref name="Jung2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun Jung|title=Korean Masculinities and Transcultural Consumption: Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop Idols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npgE-K9rawUC&amp;pg=PA165|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-66-5|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aegyo'' literally means behaving in a flirtatious, [[Flirting|coquette-ish]] manner and it is commonly expected for both male and female [[Korean pop idol|k-pop idol]]s&lt;ref name="UtzLau2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Utz|author2=Frederick Lau|title=Vocal Music and Contemporary Identities: Unlimited Voices in East Asia and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GblVHStg54oC&amp;pg=PA279|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-50224-5|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; to behave this way. However, it is not uncommon for everyday people to behave in such a way, and is widely used as an expression of affection to loved ones, families, and friends. ''Aegyo'' can also display closeness with others, which can possibly bring people together. The word is often translated as [[cuteness]] in English{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and can be compared to the Japanese concept of [[kawaii]] or to the Japanese equivalent, {{nihongo|''aikyou''|愛嬌, あいきょう}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Background==
''Aegyo'' plays a huge role in [[South Korean popular culture]], especially in idol girl groups. The higher-registered girl voice popular in girl groups in Korea has been dominant since the first successful female k-pop group [[S.E.S. (band)|S.E.S.]] emerged in 1997. This style has grown in popularity since then. A famous example of that exaggerated cuteness that is ''aegyo'' is the [[Girls' Generation]] music video for "[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]", which features much use of hands pointing at, touching and framing the face when showing the girls in turn. The first of their many song &amp; dance videos, many of Gee's dance moves are based on aegyo. ''Aegyo'' as a personal trait of Girls' Generation member [[Sunny (singer)|Sunny]] was described as "cuteness that calls for a punch," not as an actual complaint, but as a recognition of the degree to which ''aegyo'' can be taken. 

Although more common among female idol groups, male groups often perform ''aegyo'' as part of their fanservice. The ''[[maknae]]'', or youngest member of a group, is often (but not exclusively) the one encouraged to perform ''aegyo''. Another member may get a better response from fans, or be better suited due to physical or emotional characteristics. For some performers, ''aegyo'' is merely an extension of their own normal behavior, encouraged by the groups' producers. 

As performers evolve from "atul" to "young adult" images, the ''aegyo'' in their performances often evolves, becoming an almost-nostalgic homage to the performers' earlier stage image. They will "put on the character" briefly for fun and to satisfy fan expectation, in the same way they will sing their earliest hits. Some traces of ''aegyo'' will continue as persistent traits.

A pro-forma version of ''aegyo'' may become tradition for certain circumstances, such as when idols perform the "[[Gwiyomi]]" song, with actions made popular by the South Korean rapper Jung Ilhoon of [[BtoB (band)|BtoB]].

Puzar argues that ''aegyo'' in popular culture affects how young South Korean women act, especially in romantic relationships. Using cute hand gestures and expressions in photos, for example, are commonly seen behaviors in many young women in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Puzar, Aljosa. “Asian Dolls and the Western Gaze: Notes on the Female Dollification in South Korea,” ''Asian Women'' 27.2 (2011): 81-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apotheosis of Democracy''''' is a public artwork by American sculptor [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]], located on the [[United States Capitol]] House of Representatives portico's east front in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]]. This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program.&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=Apotheosis of Democracy, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!4890~!0#focus | accessdate= 15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The [[pediment|pediment's]] center focal point is the figure of allegorical [[Peace]], which is dressed in armor and is depicted protecting [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]. Leaning against Peace's proper right leg, Genius holds a torch that symbolizes [[immortality]] in his proper right hand. Peace stands in front of an [[olive tree]]. To Peace's proper left is a figure of [[Agriculture]], and next to that figure is a [[reaper]] with his assistant, a farmer with his [[bull]], a [[putti]] carrying [[grapes]], and a mother with her child who plays with a [[sheep|ram]]. To the proper right of Peace is [[Industry]], and next to him is a [[printmaker]], an [[ironworker]], a founder, a factory girl and a [[fisherman]]. The corners of the pediment have waves, which represent the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific ocean]]s. The pediment is made of [[Georgia marble]].&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

===Condition===

In 1993 ''Apotheosis of Democracy'' was surveyed by art conservators from the Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as "well maintained."&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Acquisition, creation and installation==
[[File:Capitol House of Rep Washington.jpg|thumb|left|300px|]]

The original pediment was commissioned to [[Erastus Dow Palmer]] in 1857, however, the work was never completed due to lack of funding. Another competition was held in 1908 and Bartlett was chosen.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt; The figures were modeled in [[Paris, France]] and Washington between the years of 1911-1914 and carved by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]] from 1914-1916. The pediment was dedicated on August 2, 1916.&lt;ref name="AOC"&gt;{{cite web | author=Architect of the Capitol | year= | title=Apotheosis of Democracy | work=Capitol Campus | publisher=Architect of the Capitol | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/pediments/apoth_hse.cfm | accessdate= 15 Feb 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110203094200/http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/pediments/apoth_hse.cfm| archivedate= 3 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==

In March, 1963 plaster [[maquette]]s of the pediment were given to the U.S. Government by Bartlett's stepdaughter, Armistead Peter III. The works are on display in the Capitol underground hallway that heads to the [[Rayburn House Office Building]].&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

As of 1995 a ''Study for Apotheosis of Democracy'' by Bartlett was in the collection of the [[Westmoreland Museum of American Art]]. A bronze sculpture (54 x 54.5 x 18) on a wooden base, it depicts Peace and Genius. It was purchased in 1959 and as of 1995 it was surveyed as needing urgent treatment.&lt;ref name="SOS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5664">'''Art finance''' and '''Art finance advisory''' are terms referring to a set of financial services provided by some auction houses, banks, and consulting firms, and marketed to such firms' clients who are art collectors or artists.

==Generally==
Art finance can refer to both 
* acquiring art works by financing them rather than buying them outright, and 
* collateralizing a loan with art works and related property. 
Firms offering such services differ in the range of services provided, but can include art purchase financing, art secured lending, art insurance, [[art appraisal]], [[provenance]] verification, market research, curatorial services, art investment advice, and personal shopping services.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson and McAndrew, ''The Collateral Value of Fine Art'', Journal of Banking and Finance, Jan 2006.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID878385_code542089.pdf?abstractid=878385&amp;mirid=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art loans==
Art [[loan]]s may be made for many reasons, some of which may include advances against art not yet produced (usually made to artists of some repute), advances against items to be auctioned or otherwise sold (known as a bridge loan to sale, a type of [[bridge loan]]), to finance new purchases (known as acquisition [[Finance#Forms of credit|financing]] and similar to a mortgage), and loans to assist dealers amass inventory (known as a [[working capital]] [[line of credit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Art Radar Asia, "[http://artradarasia.wordpress.com/2009/11/04/art-loans-can-offer-liquidity-to-your-collection/ Art loans can offer liquidity to your collection]", 11/4/2009 blog post.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the difficult economic climate of 2009, some banks previously offering such services discontinued them. [[UBS]], the world’s biggest wealth manager and sponsor of [[Art Basel]], announced in April 2009 that it would close its 11-year-old art advisory division.&lt;ref&gt;Bandel, ''UBS, Art Basel Sponsor, Will Close Swiss Art Division'', Bloomberg, April 1, 2009.[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601120&amp;sid=ays.nzTqcgPY&amp;refer=muse]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some start-up art financiers have stepped into the vacuum created by the departing banks, such as former [[corporate raid]]er [[Asher Edelman]], who founded [[ArtAssure Ltd.]] in 2010 to provide liquidity to the art market in the form of non-recourse art loans and unique and legally-untested methods of auction guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704094304575029583894223908?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn The Art World's Gordon Gekko]'', The Wall Street Journal, February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 the [[Museum of American Finance]] held a panel discussion on financing to support art acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Banking on Art'', MOAF, September 24, 2008. [http://www.moaf.org/resources/media/video/banking_art 54 minute Video available online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726163728/http://www.moaf.org/resources/media/video/banking_art |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the art lending market was roughly US $7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/797602/navigating-the-art-loan-biz-a-surging-industry-attracting-both-big-banks-and-loan-to-own-sharks ''Navigating the Art Loan Biz", ArtInfo, April 4th, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-profile art finance==

In late July 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the art finance firm Art Capital Group sued photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]] in the [[New York State Supreme Court]] for non-payment on a $24 million loan, seeking damages through access to her home, negatives, and all her intellectual property rights in her photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Salkin, Allen, ''Lender Sues Annie Leibovitz'', The New York Times, July 30, 2009.[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/lender-sues-annie-leibovitz/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salkin, Allen, ''For Annie Leibovitz, a Fuzzy Financial Picture'', The New York Times, July 31, 2009.[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/fashion/02annie.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2010, [[Colony Capital]] concluded a new financing and marketing agreement with Leibovitz, paying off Art Capital and removing or reducing the risks of Leibovitz losing her artistic and real estate assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8f5c62fe-2b1a-11df-93d8-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1 "Private equity firm snaps up chance to help Leibovitz put house in order"] by Henny Sender, ''Financial Times'', March 9, 2010 02:00, Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
It has been noted that art lending practices can contribute to and enable art crime by acting as a form of private banking for the art world and as such, suffer from a lack of transparency and encourage high risk borrowing behavior, as occurred with Leibovitz.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesky, Elizabeth, [http://art-crime.blogspot.com/2009/06/art-market-how-lending-fuels-art-crime.html The Art Market: How Lending Fuels Art Crime], ARCA, June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Iain Robertson of [[Sotheby's]] Institute wrote "the art market's often covert and secretive buying and selling practices do encourage or at least permit high levels of criminal behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Iain, The Art Business, Routledge, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-415-39158-0}}; and Robertson, Iain, Understanding International Art Markets and Management, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-33957-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Thomas "Chuck" Close''' (born July 5, 1940) is an American painter, artist and photographer who achieved fame as a [[photorealist]], through his massive-scale portraits.  Close often paints abstract portraits of himself and others, which hang in collections internationally. Close also creates photo portraits using a very large format camera. Even though a catastrophic spinal artery collapse in 1988 left him severely paralyzed, he has continued to paint and produce work that remains sought after by museums and collectors.

==Early life and education==
Chuck Close was born in [[Monroe, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chuck Close profile|publisher=Art in the Allen Center|url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/building/art/ChuckClose|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907154813/http://www.cs.washington.edu/building/art/ChuckClose/|archivedate=2007-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Leslie Durward Close, died when Chuck was eleven years old.

Most of his early works are very large portraits based on photographs, using  [[Photorealism]] or [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]], of family and friends, often other artists. He suffers from [[prosopagnosia]] (face blindness), and has suggested that this condition is what first inspired him to do portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosaicartnow.com/2010/07/prosopagnosia-portraitist-chuck-close|title=Mosaic Art NOW: Prosopagnosia: Portraitist Chuck Close|publisher=mosaicartnow.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821091200/http://www.mosaicartnow.com/2010/07/prosopagnosia-portraitist-chuck-close/|archivedate=August 21, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Phong Bui]] in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'', Close describes an early encounter with a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting at the [[Seattle Art Museum]]: "I went to the Seattle Art Museum with my mother for the first time when I was 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/chuck-close-9251491#early-life|title=Chuck Close|author=|date=|website=Biography|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323000921/https://www.biography.com/people/chuck-close-9251491#early-life|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; I saw this Jackson Pollock drip painting with aluminum paint, tar, gravel and all that stuff. I was absolutely outraged, disturbed. It was so far removed from what I thought art was. However, within 2 or 3 days, I was dripping paint all over my old paintings.

In 1962, Close received his B.A. from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. In 1961, he won a coveted scholarship to the Yale Summer School of Music and Art,&lt;ref name="Chuck Close"/&gt; and the following year entered the graduate degree program at [[Yale University]], where he received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1964.

Throughout his career, Chuck Close has expanded his contribution to portraiture through the mastery of such varied drawing and painting techniques as ink, graphite, pastel, watercolor, conté crayon, finger painting, and stamp-pad ink on paper; printmaking techniques, such as Mezzotint, etching, woodcuts, linocuts, and silkscreens; as well as handmade paper collage, Polaroid photographs, Daguerreotypes, and Jacquard tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/chuck-close#press Chuck Close, October 29 – December 22, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113024806/http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/chuck-close |date=January 13, 2012 }} [[Blum &amp; Poe]], Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; His early airbrush techniques inspired the development of the [[ink jet printer]].&lt;ref name="Lyle Rexer 2000"&gt;Lyle Rexer (March 12, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/arts/art-architecture-chuck-close-rediscovers-the-art-in-an-old-method.html Chuck Close Rediscovers the Art in an Old Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307110324/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/arts/art-architecture-chuck-close-rediscovers-the-art-in-an-old-method.html |date=2016-03-07 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Close had been known for his skillful brushwork as a graduate student at Yale University. There, he emulated [[Willem de Kooning]] and seemed "destined to become a third-generation [[abstract expressionist]], although with a dash of Pop iconoclasm".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; After a period in which he experimented with [[Figurative art|figurative]] constructions, Close began a series of paintings derived from black-and-white photographs of a female nude, which he copied onto canvas and painted in color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/chuck-close-920 Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805032544/http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/chuck-close-920 |date=2012-08-05 }} [[Tate Modern]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained in a 2009 interview with Cleveland, Ohio's ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper, he made a choice in 1967 to make art hard for himself and force a personal artistic breakthrough by abandoning the paintbrush. "I threw away my tools", Close said. "I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you've done before, it will push you to where you've never gone before."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, M.

Working from a gridded photograph, he builds his images by applying one careful stroke after another in multi-colors or grayscale. He works methodically, starting his loose but regular grid from the left hand corner of the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/chuck_close_photographs/ Chuck Close: Photographs, 23 July – 4 September 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123213841/http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/chuck_close_photographs/ |date=23 January 2015 }} [[White Cube]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; His works are generally larger than life and highly focused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paceprints.com/artist/172 Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318050514/http://www.paceprints.com/artist/172 |date=2012-03-18 }} Pace Prints, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; "One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like [[Richard Estes]], [[Denis Peterson]], [[Audrey Flack]], and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs. The everyday nature of the subject matter of the paintings likewise worked to secure the painting as a realist object."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Graham: American Culture in the 1980s (Twentieth Century American Culture) Edinburgh University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Close suffers from [[prosopagnosia]], also known as face blindness, in which he is unable to recognize faces. By painting portraits, he is better able to recognize and remember faces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec10/close_07-06.html For Chuck Close, an Evolving Journey Through the Faces of Others] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121223236/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec10/close_07-06.html |date=2014-01-21 }} [[PBS Newshour]] July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject, Close has said, "I was not conscious of making a decision to paint portraits because I have difficulty recognizing faces. That occurred to me twenty years after the fact when I looked at why I was still painting portraits, why that still had urgency for me. I began to realize that it has sustained me for so long because I have difficulty in recognizing faces."&lt;ref&gt;Yuskavage, Lisa. [http://bombsite.com/issues/52/articles/1868 "Chuck Close"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110818034248/http://bombsite.com/issues/52/articles/1868 |date=2011-08-18 }}, "[[BOMB Magazine]]", Summer, 1995. Retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his later paintings differ in method from his earlier canvases, the preliminary process remains the same. To create his grid work copies of photos, Close puts a grid on the photo and on the canvas and copies cell by cell. Typically, each square within the grid is filled with roughly executed regions of color (usually consisting of painted rings on a contrasting background) which give the cell a perceived 'average' hue which makes sense from a distance. His first tools for this included an airbrush, rags, razor blade, and an eraser mounted on a power drill. His first picture with this method was ''Big Self Portrait'', a black and white enlargement of his face to a {{convert|107.5|x|83.5|in|cm}} canvas, made in over four months in 1968, and acquired by the [[Walker Art Center]] in 1969. He made seven more black and white portraits during this period. He has been quoted as saying that he used such diluted paint in the airbrush that all eight of the paintings were made with a single tube of [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars Black]] acrylic.

His later work has branched into non-rectangular grids, [[topographic map]] style regions of similar colors, [[CMYK]] color grid work, and using larger grids to make the cell by cell nature of his work obvious even in small reproductions. The ''Big Self Portrait'' is so finely done that even a full page reproduction in an art book is still indistinguishable from a regular photograph.

==="The Event"===
On December 7, 1988, Close felt a strange pain in his chest. That day he was at a ceremony honoring local artists in New York City and was waiting to be called to the podium to present an award. Close delivered his speech and then made his way across the street to [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] where he suffered a seizure which left him paralyzed from the neck down. The cause was diagnosed as a spinal artery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan, Sean [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/09/art Head Master] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204075534/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/09/art |date=2016-12-04 }}, The Observer, October 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He had also suffered from neuromuscular problems as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Viveros-Faune (July 18, 2012), [http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-07-18/art/a-visit-with-art-world-hero-chuck-close/ A Visit With Art-World Hero Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901100912/http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-07-18/art/a-visit-with-art-world-hero-chuck-close/ |date=2012-09-01 }} ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Close called that day "The Event". For months, Close was in rehab strengthening his muscles with physical therapy; he soon had slight movement in his arms and could walk, yet only for a few steps. He has relied on a wheelchair ever since. Close spoke candidly about the effect disability had on his life and work in the book ''[[Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists]]'' written by [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] and [[George Plimpton]] and published by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="JKS book"&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Jean-Kennedy-Smith.aspx Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409165454/http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Jean-Kennedy-Smith.aspx |date=2011-04-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Close continued to paint with a brush strapped onto his wrist, creating large portraits in low-resolution grid squares created by an assistant.  Viewed from afar, these squares appear as a single, unified image which attempt photo-reality, albeit in pixelated form.  Although the paralysis restricted his ability to paint as meticulously as before, Close had, in a sense, placed artificial restrictions upon his hyperrealist approach well before the injury. That is, he adopted materials and techniques that did not lend themselves well to achieving a photorealistic effect. Small bits of irregular paper or inked fingerprints were used as media to achieve astoundingly realistic and interesting results. Close proved able to create his desired effects even with the most difficult of materials to control. Close has made a practice, over recent years, of representing artists who are similarly invested in portraiture, like [[Cecily Brown]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[Cindy Sherman]], and [[Zhang Huan]].&lt;ref&gt;Martha Schwendener (September 27, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/nyregion/a-review-of-chuck-close-recent-works-at-guild-hall-museum.html Works in Conversation With Photography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019163944/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/nyregion/a-review-of-chuck-close-recent-works-at-guild-hall-museum.html |date=2017-10-19 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prints===
Close has been a printmaker throughout his career, with most of his prints published by [[Pace Gallery|Pace Editions]], New York.&lt;ref name="Chuck Close"/&gt; He made his first serious foray into print making in 1972, when he moved himself and family to San Francisco to work on a [[mezzotint]] at Crown Point Press for a three-month residency. To accommodate him, Crown Point found the largest copper plate it could (36 inches wide) and purchased a new press, allowing Close to make a work that was 3 feet by 4 feet. In 1986 he went to Kyoto to work with Tadashi Toda, a highly respected woodblock printer.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlet Cheng (January 21, 2007), [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/entertainment/ca-close21 Proof is in the printing] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120820074051/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/entertainment/ca-close21 |date=2012-08-20 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, curator [[Colin Westerbeck]] used a grant from the Lannan Foundation to bring Close together with Grant Romer, director of conservation at the [[George Eastman House]].&lt;ref name="Lyle Rexer 2000"/&gt; Ever since, the artist has also continued to explore difficult photographic processes such as [[daguerreotype]] in collaboration with [[Jerry Spagnoli]] and sophisticated modular/cell-based forms such as [[tapestry]]. Close's photogravure portrait of artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]], "Robert" (1998), appeared in a 2009 exhibition at the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington, New York, featuring prints from Universal Limited Art Editions.&lt;ref&gt;Genocchio, B: [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/nyregion/long-island/08artsli.html?_r=1 Prints That Say Bold and Eclectic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010211639/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/nyregion/long-island/08artsli.html?_r=1 |date=2017-10-10 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the daguerreotype photographs, the background defines the limit of the image plane as well as the outline of the subject, with the inky pitch-black setting off the light, reflective quality of the subject's face.&lt;ref name="whitecube.com"&gt;[http://whitecube.com/artists/chuck_close/ Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904041458/http://whitecube.com/artists/chuck_close/ |date=2012-09-04 }} [[White Cube]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with Terrie Sultan, Close said: "I've had two great collaborators in the God knows how many years I've been making prints. One was the late Joe Wilfer, who was called the 'prince of pulp' … and now I'm working with [[Donald Farnsworth|Don Farnsworth]] in Oakland at…[[Magnolia Editions]]: I do the watercolor prints with him, I do the tapestries with him.

No printing is involved in their creation; colors and values appear to the viewer based on combinations of more than 17,800 colored warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads, in an echo of Close's typical grid format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Artist-s-portrait-of-Kate-Moss-dazzles-1784474.php "Artist's Portrait of Kate Moss Dazzles."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124025337/http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Artist-s-portrait-of-Kate-Moss-dazzles-1784474.php |date=2015-01-24 }} Britt, Douglas: Houston Chronicle, October 29, 2008.

Thus, portraits of Lou Reed and Roy Lichtenstein, for example, seem 'whole.' It's only when we get closer that we see the individual threads, which are woven together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://danspapers.com/2013/08/chuck-close-is-visual-magic-at-guild-hall-in-east-hampton/ "Chuck Close is Visual Magic at Guild Hall in East Hampton."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906232010/http://danspapers.com/2013/08/chuck-close-is-visual-magic-at-guild-hall-in-east-hampton/ |date=2013-09-06 }} Weiss, Marion Wolberg: Dan's Papers.

==Exhibitions==
Close's first solo exhibition, held in 1967 at the [[University Museum of Contemporary Art|University of Massachusetts Art Gallery]], Amherst, featured paintings, painted reliefs, and drawings based on photographs of record covers and magazine illustrations. The exhibition captured the attention of the university administration which promptly closed it, citing the male nudity as obscene. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) came to the defense of Close and a landmark court case ensued. A Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice decided in favor of the artist against the university. When the university appealed Close chose not to return to Boston, and ultimately the decision was overturned by an appeals court.&lt;ref name="pacegallery.com"&gt;[http://www.pacegallery.com/newyork/exhibitions/12653/nudes-1967-2014 Chuck Close: Nudes 1967–2014, February 28 – March 29, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312015116/http://www.pacegallery.com/newyork/exhibitions/12653/nudes-1967-2014 |date=March 12, 2014 }} [[Pace Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (Close was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the Arts by the University of Massachusetts in 1995.)&lt;ref name="pacegallery.com"/&gt;

On December 20, 2017, two women accused Close of sexual misconduct, claiming he made vulgar comments to them after inviting them to his studio to pose for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/418222/chuck-close-accused-sexual-misconduct/|title=Renowned Artist Chuck Close Under Fire for Alleged Sexual Misconduct [UPDATED]|publisher=Hyperallergic|accessdate=December 29, 2017|date=December 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230115517/https://hyperallergic.com/418222/chuck-close-accused-sexual-misconduct/|archivedate=December 30, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the accusations, Close issued an apology to ''[[The New York Times]]'', saying "If I embarrassed anyone or made them feel uncomfortable, I am truly sorry, I didn't mean to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/arts/design/chuck-close-sexual-harassment.html|title=Chuck Close Apologizes After Accusations of Sexual Harassment|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=December 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228125650/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/arts/design/chuck-close-sexual-harassment.html|archivedate=December 28, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Gallery of Art]] cancelled a Chuck Close exhibition, planned to open May 2018, because of the accusations of sexual misconduct that have engulfed the artist in controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Moynihan And Robin Pogrebin.

==Fundraising and community service==

In 2007 Close was honored by the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] and donated artwork for an exclusive online auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSCF Exclusive Online Art Auction Now Closed|url=http://www.nyscf.org/events/past-events/item/713-nyscf-launches-exclusive-online-art-auction-now-chuck-close-christo-and-roy-lichtenstein|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123212212/http://www.nyscf.org/events/past-events/item/713-nyscf-launches-exclusive-online-art-auction-now-chuck-close-christo-and-roy-lichtenstein|archivedate=2015-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 [[Magnolia Editions]] published two tapestry editions and three print editions by Close depicting President [[Barack Obama]]. The first tapestry was unveiled at the [[Mint Museum]] in [[North Carolina]] in honor of the [[Democratic National Convention]]. These tapestries and prints were sold as a fundraiser to support the Obama Victory Fund. A number of the works were signed by both Close and Obama. Close has previously sold work at auction to raise funds for the campaigns of [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2012/09/10/you-can-buy-chuck-closes-tapestry-portrait-of-barack-obama-for-100000/ "You Can Buy Chuck Close's Tapestry Portrait of Barack Obama for $100,000"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044816/http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2012/09/10/you-can-buy-chuck-closes-tapestry-portrait-of-barack-obama-for-100000/ |date=2013-12-13 }} artinfo.com.

In October 2013, Close donated a watercolor print of Genevieve Bahrenburg and a watercolor print self-portrait to ARTWALK NY, a cause that benefits the [[Coalition for the Homeless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahrenburg|first=Genevieve|title=Up Close and Personal: An Unexpected Sitting with Chuck Close|url=http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/becoming-art-an-unexpected-sitting-with-chuck-close/#1|work=Vogue|publisher=Conde Nast|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109063111/http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/becoming-art-an-unexpected-sitting-with-chuck-close/#1|archivedate=2014-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year work by Close was also sold to benefit the [[Lunchbox Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feedie Foodies: The Lunchbox Fund's 2013 Benefit|url=http://www.vogue.com/parties/the-lunchbox-funds-fall-fete/|work=Vogue|publisher=Conde Nast|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022020055/http://www.vogue.com/parties/the-lunchbox-funds-fall-fete/|archivedate=2013-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close was one of eight artists who volunteered in 2013 to participate in President Barack Obama's [[Turnaround Arts initiative]], which aims to improve low-performing schools by increasing student "engagement" through the arts. Close mentored 34 students in the sixth through eighth grades at Roosevelt School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], one of eight schools in the nation to participate in this public-private partnership developed in cooperation with the U.S. [[Department of Education]] and the White House [[Domestic Policy Council]]. Close was honored by mayor Bill Finch with a key to the city at the November 7 reception at the [[Housatonic Community College]] Museum of Art, where five of Close's watercolor prints were exhibited alongside artwork by students participating in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finch welcomes artist Chuck Close to Park City|url=http://www.thebridgeportnews.com/6993/finch-welcomes-artist-chuck-close-to-park-city/|work=The Bridgeport News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110150721/http://www.thebridgeportnews.com/6993/finch-welcomes-artist-chuck-close-to-park-city/|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 1998, [[PBS]] broadcast documentary filmmaker Marion Cajori's [[Emmy]]-nominated short, "Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (August 29, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/obituaries/29cajori.html Marion Cajori, 56, Filmmaker Who Explored Artistic Process, Dies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123213428/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/obituaries/29cajori.html |date=2015-01-23 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Cajori made "Chuck Close", a full-length expansion of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Zoller Seitz (December 26, 2007), [https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/movies/26chuc.html Master Portraitist, Writ Large Himself] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015184604/http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/movies/26chuc.html |date=2010-10-15 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; British art critic Christopher Finch wrote a biography, ''Chuck Close: Life'', which was published in 2010, a sequel of sorts to Finch's 2007 book, ''Chuck Close: Work'', a career-spanning monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottlieb|first=Benjamin|title=Art Books In Review: How We Talk About Chuck Close|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=January 2011|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/12/artseen/art-books-in-review-how-we-talk-about-chuck-close|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120430155831/http://brooklynrail.org/2010/12/artseen/art-books-in-review-how-we-talk-about-chuck-close|archivedate=2012-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Decoded''''' is the autobiography and memoir of rapper [[Jay-Z]], published by [[Random House]] and released November 16, 2010 on Hardcover and November 1, 2011 on Paperback.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoded|url=https://www.amazon.com/Decoded-Jay-Z/dp/1400068924/ref=br_lf_m_1000623831_1_6_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;pf_rd_p=1278243542&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_i=1000623831&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0F5A1QS83G9RD5VSFD8S|publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book combines lyrics, their explanations, anecdotes, reflections, and autobiographical information. [[Jay-Z]] explains the three reasons why he wanted to write the book being a case for hip-hop lyrics as poetry, to tell a generational story turned into powerful experiences and revolved as a story everyone can relate to.&lt;ref name="Jay2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jay-Z|title=Decoded|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=New York, New York|isbn=9781400068920|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Narrative===
The book follows very rough chronological order, while switching from current stories to his story of growing up in the [[Marcy Projects]]. The autobiographical portion focuses on growing up in poverty which led to him to drug dealing during the [[crack epidemic]], fights, and a need to share the hustlers story during the beginnings in rap. His reflections on those harsh times shaped who he is and how artists are shaped by such experiences.

===Celebrity life===
[[Jay-Z]] explains the stresses of the rap industry and the celebrity life, while also trying to put it in perspective. He illustrates this point by explaining that when he and [[Puff Daddy]] were being charged with assault there were hundreds of cameras outside the courthouse of [[Puff Daddy]]'s trial and the courthouse where the perpetrator of the [[World Trade Center bombing]] was being tried was empty.

===Opinions and reflections===
Along with the narrative, there is also a substantial portion of the book dedicated to [[Jay-Z]]'s opinions and reflections, which are often illustrated with stories. [[Jay-Z]] expounds on his relationship with [[Barack Obama]] and his involvement in politics, as well as his thoughts on the [[Hurricane Katrina]].
[[Jay-Z]] reflects on his life and especially his beginnings. He explains that he still considers himself a hustler, despite being a corporate billionaire now as founder of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. He continues and describes the comparisons between drug dealing, rapping, and boxing and how his life in the streets has molded who he is and no matter how he lives now, he still acknowledges his roots.

===Lyrics===
The book contains lyrics to thirty-six songs with some songs having only part of the song.&lt;ref name="etonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay-Z to 'Decode' Lyrics in New Book |url=http://www.etonline.com/music/101041_Jay_Z_to_Decode_Lyrics_in_New_Book/index.html |publisher=Entertainment Tonight |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019174402/http://www.etonline.com/music/101041_Jay_Z_to_Decode_Lyrics_in_New_Book/index.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the lyrics, there are annotations and footnotes that Jay-Z writes to explain the lyrics to the reader. The explanations range from just explaining what a "brick" is to in depth analysis and explanation of lines that underscore the points that [[Jay-Z]] makes in his writing.

==Critical response==
Most of the criticism is that the book is not personal enough and does not provide enough detail of [[Jay-Z]]'s life. Simon Vozick-Levinson writes in [[Entertainment Weekly]] ""Despite the career he has made out of rapping in the first person, Jay-Z is known for prizing privacy. His new book 'Decoded' may not erase that reputation." Although Vozick Levinson expands and reveals "it is nonetheless [[Shawn Carter]]'s most honest airing of the experiences he drew on to create the mythic figure of [[Jay-Z]],"  while giving the book a grade of A-.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=Book Review: Decoded, Jay-Z|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20440841,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adam Bradley of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] criticizes the structure of the book because it is not organized by chronological order, but by subject as well as criticizes its lack of depth in some areas by explaining "At times, these subject-driven sections leave one dissatisfied with the level of revelation and reflection, such as in his cursory treatment of race relations.&lt;ref name="bnreview.barnesandnoble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Adam|title=Life of an Artist: Decoded, Jay-Z|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Decoded/ba-p/3619|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Plagiarism claims==
On June 13, 2012 a lawsuit was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] accusing [[Jay-Z]] and coauthor [[Dream Hampton]] of copyright infringement and invasion of privacy for ''Decoded.'' The lawsuit, filed by Patrick White also names [[Random House]], the company that published ''Decoded.'' White alleges "In 2009, my personal computer was compromised, resulting in my personal work to be used in [[Jay-Z]]'s book 'Decoded' which was released in 2010.&lt;ref name="xxlmag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Narunsky|first=Kim|title=Jay-Z Sued For Copyright Infringement Over Decoded Book|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/06/jay-z-sued-for-copyright-infringement-over-decoded-book/|publisher=XXL Magazine|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;" White is claiming that he was working on a book on his personal computer when it was compromised and when reading ''Decoded'', he noticed a resemblance in "expressions/color/phrases, which correlates to my work.&lt;ref name="xxlmag" /&gt;"  In the handwritten lawsuit, White alleges that he sought out [[Jay-Z]] and [[Dream Hampton]], but they were unresponsive to his contact.&lt;ref name="allhiphop"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Greg|title=EXCLUSIVE: Jay-Z Sued Over Book "Decoded"|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/06/18/exclusive-jay-z-sued-over-book-decoded/|publisher=All Hip-Hop.com|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Music History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published annually by [[Cambridge University Press]], which specialises in the study of [[music]] from the [[early Middle Ages]] to the end of the 17th century. It was established in 1981 and is edited by [[Iain Fenlon]].
{{cquote|''Early Music History'' exists to stimulate further exploration of familiar phenomena through unfamiliar means, and to add to the growing appreciation of the value of interdisciplianary approaches and their potentialities.  Another emphasis might be called the contextual.  At present some music historians tend to concentrate on the internal analysis of a composition and its relation to a specific and usually narrowly defined historical frame.  Indeed, much musicological writing presents by implication a formidable orthodoxy in which history is perceived as a succession of paradigms of musical language, style, and form.  Some recent work has attempted explanation through exploration of a wider range of evidence, and Early Music History intends to strengthen this trend by encouraging studies that examine the economic, political, and social ramifications of research.  In that musicology itself can on benefit if its vision is extended and its methods refined and broadened, the board believes that ''Early Music History'' will mark a new departure in the development of the discipline while continuing to support its traditional tasks.|15px|15px|Iain Fenlon, preface to Volume I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iain Fenlon |title=Preface |journal=Early Music History |volume=1 |pages=vii-vii |year=1981|doi= 10.1017/S0261127900000243|url= |issn=1474-0559}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Electric-Techno Neon Gods''' ({{zh|c=電音三太子|p=Diànyīn Sāntàizi|poj=Tiān-im Sam-thài-chú}}), '''sam thai tsu''' ({{zh|c=三太子|p=Sāntàizi|poj=Sam-thài-chú}}), or '''[[Techno]] Prince [[Nezha]]''' is a [[subcultural]] dance performance which combines a traditional [[Taiwan]] folk dance performance ({{zh|t=陣頭|p=zhèntóu|poj=tīn-thâu}}) with modern pop music.

There are two theories about the origin of the Electric-Techno Neon Gods. One says it is from [[Beigang]] Township, [[Yunlin]] County, Taiwan; while the other one says it started from [[Puzi]] City, [[Chiayi]] County, Taiwan. According to reliable sources,{{Who|date=January 2014}} some people dressed up as bodyguards of the gods ({{zh|c=大仙尪仔|poj=tōa-sian ang-á}}) and performed similar dances during religious parades at local temples. As many of the dancers were young people who enjoyed going [[clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]], they began combining the traditional dances with [[electronic music]]. Later on, professional dance teams specializing in Electric-Techno Neon Gods dancing were formed. The costumes worn by dancers are based on traditional outfits with trendy elements added to them, such as oversized sunglasses and LED lights. White gloves are commonly worn as in Taiwan it is popular to wear gloves while dancing.

Apart from being performed during religious rituals, Electric-Techno Neon Gods dances now often take place during many secular events in Taiwan. Such dances were performed during the opening ceremonies of the [[World Games 2009]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=EGods on Scooters|url=http://poeticborg.wordpress.com/tag/world-games/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104031036/http://poeticborg.wordpress.com/tag/world-games/|archivedate=4 January 2014|publisher=Poeticborg.wordpress.com|date=17 July 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], [[Expo 2010 Shanghai China]], the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition, and other international activities and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{citation|title='Electric Techno Neon God' debut in Fuzhou|url=http://fuzhou.chinadaily.com.cn/e/2011-12/02/content_14201677.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102235808/http://fuzhou.chinadaily.com.cn/e/2011-12/02/content_14201677.htm|archivedate=2 January 2014|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=2 December 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etruscan art''' was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 350-351&lt;/ref&gt; 

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.  

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects. 

[[Bucchero]] wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery.  There was also a tradition of elaborate [[Etruscan vase painting]], which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].  Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta [[antefix]]es and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished.  Etruscan art was strongly connected to [[Etruscan religion|religion]]; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.&lt;ref name="etruscianartmusic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Etruscan Art |first=Nigel |last=Spivey|year=1997 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see|Etruscan history}}
The Etruscans emerged from the preceding [[Villanovan culture]]. Due to the proximity and/or commercial contact to Etruria, other ancient cultures influenced Etruscan art, such as [[Ancient Greek art|Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Middle East]]. &lt;!--   The apparent simple character in the [[Hellenistic]] era conceals an innovative and unique style whose pinnacle coincided with the [[Archaic period in Greece|Greek archaic period]]. ??? What, if anything, does this mean?--&gt; The Romans would later come to absorb the [[Etruscan society|Etruscan culture]] into theirs but would also be greatly influenced by them and their art.

===Periods===
[[File:A dancing man from the painted walls of the tomb of the Augurs at Tarquinia, 525-500 BCE, Etruscan.jpg|thumb|[[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] dancer in the [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
Etruscan art is usually divided into a number of periods: 

*900 to 675 BC – '''Early Villanovan''' period. Already the emphasis on [[funerary art]] is evident. [[Impasto pottery]] with geometric decoration, or shaped as [[hut urn]]s.  Bronze objects, mostly small except for vessels, were decorated by moulding or by incised lines. Small statuettes were mostly handles or other fittings for vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;    
*675–575 BC – '''Oriental''' or Orientalising period.  Foreign trade with established Mediterranean civilizations interested in the metal ores of Etruria and other products from further north led to imports of foreign art, especially that of Ancient Greece, and some Greek artists immigrated.  Decoration adopted a Greek, Egyptian and Near Eastern vocabulary with [[palmette]]s and other motifs, and the foreign [[lion]] was a popular animal to depict. The Etruscan upper class grew wealthy and began to fill their large tombs with [[grave goods]].  A native [[Bucchero]] pottery, now using the [[potter's wheel]], went alongside the start of a Greek-influenced tradition of painted vases, which until 600 drew more from [[Corinth]] than [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (ii); Boardman, 349&lt;/ref&gt;   
*575–480 BC – '''Archaic''' period - Prosperity continued to grow, and Greek influence grew to the exclusion of other Mediterranean cultures, despite the two cultures coming into conflict as their respective zones of expansion met each other. The period saw the emergence of the Etruscan temple, with its elaborate and brightly painted [[terracotta]] decorations, and other larger buildings.  Figurative art, including human figures and narrative scenes, grew more prominent.  The Etruscans adopted stories from [[Greek mythology]] enthusiastically.  Paintings in [[fresco]] begin to be found in tombs (which the Greeks had stopped making centuries before), and were perhaps made for some other buildings.  The Persian conquest of [[Ionia]] in 546 saw a significant influx of Greek artist refugees.  Other earlier developments continued, and the period produced much of the finest and most distinctive Etruscan art.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iii)&lt;/ref&gt;   
*480–300 BC – '''Classical''' period - The Etruscans had now peaked in economic and political terms, and the volume of art produced reduced somewhat in the 5th century, with prosperity shifting from the coastal cities to the interior, especially the [[Po valley]].  In the 4th century volumes revived somewhat, and previous trends continued to develop without major innovations in the repertoire, except for the arrival of [[red-figure vase painting]], and more sculpture such as sarcophagi in stone rather than terracotta. Bronzes from [[Vulci]] were exported widely within Etruria and beyond.  The Romans were now picking off the Etruscan cities one by one, with [[Veii]] being conquered around 396.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iv)&lt;/ref&gt;
*300–50 BC – '''Hellenistic''' or late phase.  Over this period the remaining Etruscan cities were all absorbed into Roman culture, and the extent to which art and architecture should be described as Etruscan or Roman is often difficult to judge. Distinctive Etruscan types of object gradually ceased to be made, with the last painted vases appearing early in the period, and large painted tombs ending in the 2nd century.  Styles continued to follow broad Greek trends, with increasing sophistication and classical realism often accompanied by a loss of energy and character.  [[Bronze]] statues, now increasingly large, were sometimes replicas of Greek models.  The large [[Greek temple]] [[pediment]] groups of sculptures were introduced, but in terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (v)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==

The Etruscans were very accomplished sculptors for which notable examples in terracotta and bronze are testimony. Though the renowned "[[Capitoline Wolf]]" (at the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline Museum]] of Rome) is now suggested to have been manufactured in the 13th century AD, some of the more famous examples include (in rough chronological order):

*The [[Centaur of Vulci]], 590–580 BC, [[National Etruscan Museum]], from the [[Villa Giulia]]
*the painted terracotta [[Apollo of Veii]], 510–500 BC, from the temple at [[Portanaccio]] attributed to [[Vulca]] at the [[National Etruscan Museum]]
*the painted terracotta [[Sarcophagus of the Spouses]], late 6th century BC, from Cerveteri at the National Etruscan Museum
*the bronze [[Chimera of Arezzo]], dated 400 BC, at the National Archaeological Museum (Florence)
*The [[Mars of Todi]], a [[bronze sculpture]] from 400 BC in the [[Museo Etrusco Gregoriano]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] 
*The [[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]], 150–140 BC, a masterpiece of Etruscan art in terracotta, now at the [[British Museum]]
*[[The Orator]], or Aule Metele ("L'Arringatore" in Italian), bronze found in Umbria now at the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)]])

The [[Apollo of Veii]] is a good example of the mastery with which Etruscan artists produced these large art pieces. It was made, along with others, to adorn the temple at [[Portanaccio]]’s roof line. Although its style is reminiscent of the Greek [[Kroisos Kouros]], the notion of having statues on the top of the roof is entirely an Etruscan derivation.&lt;ref name ="Ramage 2009"&gt;(Ramage 2009: 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall-painting==
{{see|Tomb of the Leopards}}
[[File:Tomba del Triclinio SAM 3996.JPG|thumb|Fuller view of the tomb illustrated above]]
[[File:Tomba degli Auguri.jpg|thumb|Rear wall painting in [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
The Etruscan paintings that have survived are almost all wall [[fresco]]es from tombs, mainly located in [[Tarquinia]], and dating from roughly 670 BC to 200 BC, with the peak of production between about 520 and 440 BC.  The Greeks very rarely painted their tombs in the equivalent period, with rare exceptions such as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]] and southern Italy, and the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] royal tombs at [[Vergina]].  The whole tradition of Greek painting on walls and panels, arguably the form of art that Greek contemporaries considered their greatest, is almost entirely lost, giving the Etruscan tradition, which undoubtedly drew much from Greek examples, an added importance, even if it does not approach the quality and sophistication of the best Greek masters.  It is clear from literary sources that temples, houses and other buildings also had wall-paintings, but these have all been lost, like their Greek equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Steingräber, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etruscan tombs, which housed the remains of whole lineages, were apparently sites for recurrent family rituals, and the subjects of paintings probably have a more religious character than might at first appear. A few detachable painted terracotta panels have been found in tombs, up to about a metre tall, and fragments in city centres.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 243; Vermeule, 157-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The frescoes are created by applying paint on top of fresh plaster, so that when the plaster dries the painting becomes part of the plaster, and consequently an integral part of the wall. Colors were created from ground up minerals of different colors and were then mixed to the paint. Fine brushes were made of animal hair.

From the mid 4th century BC [[chiaroscuro]] modelling began to be used to portray depth and volume.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 352&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes scenes of everyday life are portrayed, but more often traditional mythological scenes. The depiction of human anatomy never approaches Greek levels. The concept of proportion does not appear in any surviving frescoes and we frequently find portrayals of animals or men out of proportion. One of the best-known Etruscan frescoes is that of the Tomb of the Lioness at Tarquinia.

==Vase painting==

{{main|Etruscan vase painting}}
Etruscan vase painting was produced from the 7th through the 4th centuries BC, and is a major element in Etruscan art. It was strongly influenced by [[Greek vase painting]], followed the main trends in style, especially those of [[Athens]], over the period, but lagging behind by some decades. The Etruscans used the same techniques, and largely the same shapes. Both the [[black-figure vase painting]] and the later [[red-figure vase painting]] techniques were used.  The subjects were also very often drawn from Greek mythology in later periods. 

Besides being producers in their own right, the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek pottery outside Greece, and some Greek painters probably moved to Etruria, where richly decorated vases were a standard element of grave inventories.  It has been suggested that many or most elaborately painted vases were specifically bought to be used in burials, as a substitute, cheaper and less likely to attract robbers, for the vessels in silver and bronze that the elite would have used in life.

More fully characteristic of Etruscan ceramic art are the burnished, unglazed [[bucchero]] terracotta wares, rendered black in a reducing kiln deprived of oxygen. This was an Etruscan development based on the pottery techniques of the Etruscans' Villanovan predecessors.

==Painted terracotta panels==
A few large terracotta [[Pinax|pinakes]] or plaques, much larger than are typical in Greek art, have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork==
[[File:Etruscan antiquities in the British Museum DSCF0012 02.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Relief mirror-back with "Herekele" ([[Hercules]]) seizing Mlacuch (500–475 BC)]]
The Etruscans were masters of bronze-working as shown by the many outstanding examples in museums, and from accounts of the statues sent to Rome after their conquest. &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome as a Museum: Power, Identity, and the Culture of Collecting, Steven Rutledge, OUP Oxford, 26 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pliny, the Romans looted 2,000 bronze statues from the city of [[Volsinii]] alone after capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny: Historia Naturalis xxxiv.16&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[Monteleone chariot]] is one of the finest examples of large bronzework and is the best-preserved and most complete of the surviving works.

The Etruscans had a strong tradition of working in [[bronze]] from very early times, and their small bronzes were widely exported. Apart from cast bronze, the Etruscans were also skilled at the engraving of cast pieces with complex linear images, whose lines were filled with a white material to highlight them; in modern museum conditions with this filling lost, and the surface inevitably somewhat degraded, they are often much less striking and harder to read than would have been the case originally. This technique was mostly applied to the roundish backs of polished bronze mirrors and to the sides of [[cista]]e.  A major centre for cista manufacture was [[Praeneste]], which somewhat like early Rome was an Italic-speaking town in the Etruscan cultural sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;  Some mirrors, or mirror covers (used to protect the mirror's reflective surface) are in a low [[relief]].

==Funerary art==
[[File:British Museum Etruscan 8-2.jpg|thumb|Painted terracotta [[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]], about 150–130 BCE]]

The Etruscans excelled in portraying humans. Throughout their history they used two sets of burial practices: [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]].&lt;ref&gt;(Turfa 2005: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Cinerary urns (for cremation) and sarcophagi (for inhumation) have been found together in the same tomb showing that throughout generations, both forms were used at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 56, note 1)&lt;/ref&gt;   
In the 7th century they started depicting human heads on canopic urns and when they started burying their dead in the late 6th century they did so in terracotta sarcophagi.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"&gt;(Ramage 2009:51)&lt;/ref&gt; These sarcophagi were decorated with an image of the deceased reclining on the lid alone or sometimes with a spouse.  The Etruscans invented the custom of placing figures on the lid which later influenced the Romans to do the same.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"/&gt; These urns were widely popular in Etruria and, from there, the style made its way to Chiusi. Etruscans made urns using unrefined clay such as impasto. This was discovered due to their almost exact resemblance to one another. They have been identified as far back as the third century B.C. and are technically still used to this day (caskets.) Examples of these pieces can be found today in museums all around the world.

The Hellenistic period funerary urns were generally made in two pieces. The top lid usually depicted a banqueting man or woman (but not always) and the container part was either decorated in relief in the front only or, on more elaborate stone pieces, carved on its sides.&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 34)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the terracotta urns were being mass-produced using clay in Northern Etruria (specifically in and around [[Chiusi]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 100)&lt;/ref&gt; Often the scenes decorated in relief on the front of the urn were depicting generic Greek influenced scenes.&lt;ref&gt;(Nielsen 1995:328)&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these urns did not require skilled artists and so what we are left with is often mediocre, unprofessional art, made en masse.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; However the color choices on the urns offer evidence as to dating, as colors used changed over time.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Art and religion==
[[Image:5th-4th century BCE Etruscan necklace by Mary Harrsch.jpg|thumb|5th to 4th century BC necklace in gold]]
Etruscan art was often religious in character and, hence, strongly connected to the requirements of [[Etruscan religion]].  The Etruscan afterlife was negative, in contrast to the positive view in [[ancient Egypt]] where it was but a continuation of earthly life, or the confident relations with the gods as in [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greece]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}}  Roman interest in Etruscan religion centred on their methods of [[divination]] and propitiating and discovering the will of the gods, rather than the gods themselves, which may have distorted the information that has come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Most remains of Etruscan [[funerary art]] have been found in excavations of cemeteries (as at [[Cerveteri]], [[Tarquinia]], [[Populonia]], [[Orvieto]], [[Vetulonia]], [[Norchia]]), meaning that what we see of Etruscan art is primarily dominated by depictions of religion and in particular the [[funerary cult]], whether or not that is a true reflection of Etruscan art as a whole.

==Museums==
Etruscan tombs were heavily looted from early on, initially for precious metals.  From the Renaissance onwards Etruscan objects, especially painted vases and sarcophagi, were keenly collected. Many were exported before this was forbidden, and most major museum collections of classical art around the world have good selections.  But the major collections remain in Italian museums in Rome, Florence, and other cities in areas that were formerly Etruscan, which include the results of [[modern archaeology]].

Major collections in Italy include the [[National Etruscan Museum]] ({{lang-it|Museo Nazionale Etrusco}}) in the [[Villa Giulia]] in Rome, [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in Florence, [[Vatican Museums]], [[Tarquinia National Museum]], and the [[The Archeological Civic Museum (MCA) of Bologna|Archeological Civic Museum]] in [[Bologna]], as well as more local collections near important sites such as [[Cerveteri]], [[Orvieto]] and [[Perugia]].

{{Feminism sidebar}}
Feminist literature is fiction, nonfiction, drama or poetry which supports the [[Feminism|feminist]] goals of defining, establishing and defending equal [[Civil and political rights|civil, political, economic]] and [[social rights]] for women. It often identifies women's roles as unequal to those of men – particularly as regards status, privilege and power – and generally portrays the consequences to women, men, families, communities and societies as undesirable.

== History ==

In the 15th Century [[Christine de Pizan]] wrote [[The Book of the City of Ladies]] which combats prejudices and enhances the importance of women in society. The book follow the model of [[De Mulieribus Claris]] written in the 14th Century by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].	{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era. 

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. 

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels. 

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist children's literature==
{{main|Feminist children's literature}}
Feminist children's literature is the writing of [[children's literature]] through a feminist lens. Children's literature and [[women's literature]] have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of feminist literature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=Children's Literature as Women's Writing|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1988|volume=13.1|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0264|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the [[feminist movement]], especially in the past half century. In her book ''Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues "Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=South End|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist science fiction==
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
Feminist science fiction is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] (abbreviated "SF") focused on theories that include [[feminist]] themes including but not limited to [[gender inequality]], [[sexuality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[economics]], and [[reproduction]]. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or [[dystopias]] to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA1"&gt;{{citation | last = Helford | first = Elyce Rae | contribution = Feminism | editor-last = Westfahl | editor-first = Gary | title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: themes, works and wonders | pages = 289–291 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780313329531 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA290 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice. No other genres so actively invite representations of the ultimate goals of feminism: worlds free of sexism, worlds in which women's contributions (to science) are recognized and valued, worlds that explore the diversity of women's desire and sexuality, and worlds that move beyond gender.|Elyce Rae Helford&lt;ref name="Helford, p.291"&gt;Helford, p.291.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Frederick Edward Hulme''' (March 1841 – 10 April 1909) was known as a teacher and an amateur botanist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Hulme, Frederick Edward|magazine=Who's Who|year=1908|page=925|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015047640118;view=1up;seq=933}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Professor of Freehand and Geometrical Drawing at [[King's College London]] from 1886. His most famous work was ''Familiar Wild Flowers'' which was issued in nine volumes.

==Life==
Frederick Edward Hulme was born to [[Frederick William Hulme]] and his wife Caroline (born Jackson). He was born in March 1841 in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ‘Hulme, Frederick Edward (1841–1909)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34047, accessed 9 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844 his family moved to London where his father taught and worked as a landscape painter.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Albert Nicholson, ‘Hulme, Frederick William (1816–1884)’, rev. Romita Ray, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14116, accessed 9 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was Hulme's father an accomplished landscape painter, but his maternal grandmother had also been a painter of porcelain. Hulme attended [[South Kensington School of Art]], which is now called the Royal College of Art.
[[File:FrederickEdwardHulmeCactusFlowers.jpg|thumb|right|Cactus flower]]
Hulme became the drawing master at [[Marlborough College]] in 1870&lt;ref name=kings/&gt; and while there he started work on his most famous work. ''Familiar Wild Flowers'' was issued in parts as not only did it contain a detailed description of each flower but also  its medicinal uses and habitat. The major work was the botanical illustration by Hulme of each flower which was recreated as a colour plate in each volume. In his lifetime, Hulme completed nine volumes which were published at intervals.

Hulme was an amateur botanist, antiquarian and natural historian and in 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]].&lt;ref name=linnean&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsoflin190609linn/proceedingsoflin190609linn_djvu.txt Obituary], Proceedings of the Linnean Society, p.42, accessed April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was drawing master at Marlborough until 1883.&lt;ref name=kings/&gt;

He was the Professor of Freehand and Geometrical Drawing at [[King's College London]] from 1886. Drawing was not part of the standard curriculum at Kings, but as was common in many colleges, students could enroll for an additional course in drawing with Hulme.&lt;ref name=kings&gt;[http://access.kcl.clientarea.net/content/1/c4/38/08/comment164.pdf A Botanical Artist at Kings], Comment, Kings College Newsletter, p.11, No 164, December 2005, accessed April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding year he had become a lecturer to the Agricultural Association.

Botany seems not to be his only interest as he also published books on [[heraldry]], and on [[cryptography]] (Cryptography, the History, Principles, and Practice of Cipher-Writing) - a brief history and an explanation of various techniques of cryptography to his day (end of 19th century).&lt;ref name=cryptobook&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hulme|first1=Frederick Edward|title=Cryptography: or the history, principles and practice of cipher-writing|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924074296256|website=Archive.org|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulme died at his home at [[Kew]] on 10 April 1909. His ninth volume of ''Familiar Wild Flowers'' was in production.&lt;ref name=linnean/&gt; This and the earlier other eight volumes were published after his death.

The [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] [[rock relief]] '''Fıraktın relief''' (or ''Fraktın'') is located roughly 50&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kayseri]] in the [[Kayseri Province|province of the same name]] in southern [[Turkey]], at Fıraktın on the bank of the Enzel Dere, a tributary of the [[Zamantı River|Zamantı Irmağı]]. [[Strabo]] called the place ''Dastarkon''.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The relief is in a steep valley, between [[Mount Erciyes]] and the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]] east of [[Develi]]. The valley was historically an important route into [[Cilicia]] (and from there into [[Syria]] via the Gezbeli and Küçük Gezbeli passes). A [[Mycenaean pottery|Mycenaean vase]] was found nearby, which probably came via Cilicia.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Goetze: ''Kulturgeschichte Kleinasiens''. C. H. Beck, München 1974, S. 182. {{ISBN|9783406013515}}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=iY6SwMfNjIoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Firaktin&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Firaktin&amp;f=false bei GoogleBooks]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1939, five reliefs from Hittite times were discovered in this location, more than in any other spot in Anatolia. The other four reliefs are [[Hanyeri relief|Hanyeri]], [[İmamkullu relief|İmamkullu]] and [[Taşçı reliefs|Taşçı A and B]].&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The relief is about 1.3 m x 3.2 m and was made in the 13th century BC, in the time of the Hittite empire. It faces northwest, towards Mount Erciyes, which like all mountains was worshiped in Hittite times. The relief is in three parts.

The left section shows the [[List of Hittite kings|Hittite king]] [[Hattusili III]] (right) making an offering to the [[weather god]], pouring water from a kind of beaked flagon into a vessel on the ground. Between them there is an altar like structure, with a grooved, conical item on top, probably offering-bread. Both the god and the king wear pointed hats, which symbolised divinity. From this, it can be concluded that the image was probably made after Hattusili's death in the reign of his son and successor [[Tudhaliya IV]], since the Hittite kings were considered divine after their deaths. The weather god holds a crook in his hands. In front of each of their heads are hieroglyphic symbols, naming the depicted individuals.

[[File:Puduhepa.jpg|thumb|The Sun goddess &amp; Puduhepa]]
In the middle scene is his wife, [[Tawannanna]] [[Puduhepa]] (right), making a [[libation]] to the Sun goddess [[Hebat]]. There is an altar between these two figures as well, with a bird or a bird-shaped vessel on top of it. The depiction gets rougher on the right end; probably the work was not finished.

The third part of the relief consists of massive [[Luwian hieroglyphs]]. The continue the description of the queen which begins beside her head, "Daughter of the land of [[Kizzuwatna]], beloved by the divine."&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt;

[[File:Firaktin2Kayseri.jpg|thumb|Copy at the Kayseri Museum]]
A concrete copy of the relief can be viewed at the Kayseri Museum, as well as a plaster cast in the [[Pergamonmuseum]] in Berlin.

'''GPS Drawing,''' also known as '''GPS Art''' and '''Strava Art''', is a method of [[drawing]] where an uses a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) device and follows a pre planned route to create a large-scale picture or text on a map.  Artists usually run or cycle the route though cars, vans, and aeroplanes are used to create larger pieces. 

==Planning==
GPS artists can spend many hours finding a certain image or text hidden in a map or can sometimes simply see an existing image in a map due to [[Pareidolia]].  In many cities and towns the road layout and landscape restricts the routes available so artisst have to find creative ways to show their pictures or characters.  In cities where there is a strong grid pattern an 8-bit style or [[pixelated]] images can be created of almost any object or shape.  Many artists will create paper or digital maps of their route to follow on their journey.

== Artistic Style ==
There are many approaches to GPS Drawing which an artist can choose depending or their means of travel and the landscape around them.

==== Roads, Trails, and Paths Only ====
This style uses only pre existing roads, paths, trails, etc. which can make it more challenging to find a route and plan the artwork.  On the other hand following these paths makes navigation during the journey much easier and the artwork is more likely to reflect the original plan.  This is how the majority of GPS artworks are made.

==== Freehand on Open Ground or in Open Air ====
Freehand GPS drawing is where artist creates a shape on open ground without following existing paths which means the artist has to watch their progress in real time on their GPS device.  Artists can run or cycle over open ground such as parks, fields, and car parks.  Artists in cars and other motor vehicles can draw shapes on large open areas such as deserts, airfields, and beaches.  Almost all artworks created by aircraft and watercraft use this technique as they are not restricted by human and [[physical geography]].  Freehand GPS drawing opens unlimited possibilities but without [[Waypoint|waypoints]] and existing routes it is very easy to loose track of your progress and make mistakes.

==== Pausing the GPS Device ====
By pausing the GPS device and restarting it at different locations an artist is able to draw straight lines across the map though the built environment and over physical barriers.  Though this can create very striking images and open up new possibilities in a city most artists do not use technique.

==== Adding Extra Images ====
Some artists add extra images or lines to the map after they have created the route.  They can do this to simply add [[googly eyes]] to an animal or face or go further add lines and other features which help viewers see what they have drawn.  Other times an artist will show a photo or other image alongside their drawing if it is not clear at first glance what has been drawn.

== Display ==
Most people use a route mapping app or other service to display their drawing online and to share on social media.  Popular apps include Strava, Map My Run, and Garmin.  Many artists also import their route into [[Google Maps]], [[OpenStreetMap|Open Streetmap]], Viweranger, and other map services before capturing the image to display and share.  This gives the artist the option of expanding and cropping the image, orienting it another way, or tilting the map to add perspective.  Some artists use [[False color|false color maps]] then choose contrasting colors for their route to create vivid images.

==Examples and Artists==
The idea was first implemented by artists Hugh Pryor and [[Jeremy Wood]], whose work includes a 13-mile wide fish in [[Oxfordshire]], spiders with legs 21 miles long in [[Port Meadow, Oxford]],&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; and "the world's biggest 'IF'": a pair of letters, "I", which goes from [[Iffley]] in [[Oxford]] to [[Southampton]] and back, and "F" which traverses through the Ifield Road in [[London]] down to [[Iford, East Sussex]], through [[Iford]] and back up through [[Ifold]] in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt; The total length is 537&amp;nbsp;km, and the height of the drawing in [[typographic unit]]s is 319,334,400 [[point (typography)|point]]s.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|title=2003: The 3rd Annual Year in Ideas; GPS Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-gps-art.html|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical computer fonts at standard resolutions are between 8 and 12 points.

In early 2014 programmer Joe Rosen released a GPS-A-Sketch GPS sketching app for iOS, through the iTunes App Store.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 2016, musicians [[Shaun Buswell]] &amp; Erik Nyberg travelled around the [[United Kingdom]] drawing a 400+ mile penis across [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theocelot.co.uk/two-musicians-have-drawn-a-giant-wedding-tackle-during-their-uk-tour-using-gps-tracking/|title=Two musicians have drawn a giant “wedding tackle” during their UK tour using GPS tracking|publisher=The Ocelot|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 artist Nathan Rae created a #WeLoveManchester piece as part of the cememorations of the [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena Bombing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/strava-map-manchester-heart-runner-14694321|title=The runner who made a 67-mile Strava heart all around Manchester|last=Johnson|first=Helen|date=2018-05-23|work=men|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific GPS artists is the artist known as [https://www.instagram.com/wallygpx/ WalleyGPX] who, as of October 2018, has created over 500 pieces of GPS art.  He uses pencil and paper to plan the routes around his home city of [[Baltimore]] which he then creates by bicycle.

'''''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner''''' is a 1967 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] produced and directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], and written by [[William Rose (screenwriter)|William Rose]]. It stars [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Sidney Poitier]], and [[Katharine Hepburn]], and features Hepburn's niece [[Katharine Houghton]].

The film was one of the few films of the time to depict an [[interracial marriage]] in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States, and still was illegal in 17 states—mostly [[Southern United States|Southern states]]—until 12 June 1967, six months before the film was released, roughly two weeks after Tracy filmed his final scene (and two days after his death), when [[anti-miscegenation laws]] were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. The film's [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated score was composed by [[Frank De Vol]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Albums 1955-2001 (Menomonee Falls, WI: Record Research, 2001), 1018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is notable for being the ninth and final on-screen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn, with filming ending just 17 days before Tracy's death. Hepburn never saw the completed film,&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; saying the memories of Tracy were too painful. The film was released in December 1967, six months after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061735/|title=Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)|author=Claudio Carvalho|date=12 December 1967|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Hepburn tracy guess whos coming to dinner.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy as Christina and Matt Drayton]]

Twenty-three year old Joanna Drayton's unannounced early return from her Hawaiian vacation causes a stir when she brings her new fiancé to her upper-class family home in San Francisco. He is John Prentice: a 37-year-old Negro  (the 1967 dialogue uses the term [[Negro]] throughout) physician and medical professor, whom she met just 10 days prior, whose first wife and young son were killed in a train accident eight years earlier.

Joanna's parents – newspaper publisher Matt Drayton and his wife, art gallery owner Christina – are avowed liberals who have always instilled in her the idea of racial equality. Although they try to hide it, Joanna's parents and in particular her father are initially upset that she is planning to marry a Negro man. The Draytons' black maid for 22 years, Tillie, is even more horrified, telling Joanna that John is trying to "get above himself" by marrying a white woman, but Joanna
asks why it is okay that she loves Tillie but she shouldn’t love John, who is “just as black”.

The Draytons are unsettled by her engagement with John, since they never thought that her choice would be a Negro man, and further unsettled by John's decision that if Joanna's parents do not accept the engagement that day, then he will end it.

Adding to the situation is that Joanna, at first intending to join John in a few weeks in Geneva for their planned marriage ceremony, has now decided that she will join him when he leaves after dinner to fly to a meeting in New York City, then onward to Switzerland, where he is an assistant director with the [[World Health Organization]]. She has also invited John's parents to fly up from Los Angeles for dinner, so they can all become acquainted. Due to this invitation, what was intended to be a sit-down steak dinner for two turns into a meet-the-in-laws dinner party. Furthermore, John is forced to reveal that he had not yet told his parents of his intention to marry a white woman.

Matt's golf buddy, Catholic [[Monsignor]] Mike Ryan, stops by after Matt earlier cancelled their golf game. After learning of John, he shares Joanna's enthusiasm for the pending nuptials and tells her father as much. However, Matt says he cannot give the couple his blessing: he fears that Joanna will be hurt by the prejudice that John and she will surely encounter.

One of Christina's art gallery employees, Hilary, who had briefly met John and Joanna earlier in the day, stops by the Draytons' home to express her disapproval over the relationship. Though Christina is still unsure of her own feelings about the matter, she is so offended at Hilary's racism that she fires her on the spot. Later, when dressing for dinner, Christina shares with Matt her support for Joanna, even if it should mean having to fight her husband.

Cocktails at the Drayton home resemble a game of [[musical chairs]], as different permutations of parents and clergy and children gather and share their views about the situation, with the mothers generally expressing more faith in their children than the fathers. Universally, the parents express that more than a few hours are necessary for a proper decision.

Mrs. Prentice tells Matt that her husband and he, in growing old, have forgotten what it is like to feel romantic passion; if they remembered, they would see that as more important for their children than any racial problem.

When the elder Prentice tells John that he is making a huge mistake, John pushes back that his father thinks of himself “as a coloured man, (while) I think of myself as a man.”

After thinking about the situation, and his conversation with Mrs. Prentice in particular, Matt calls everyone together (including Tillie) to make an announcement. He says that it does not matter what everyone else may think about John and Joanna getting married; all that matters is that they love each other. The film ends with the two families and Monsignor Ryan finally sitting down to dinner.

According to Kramer,  Rose and he intentionally structured the film to debunk ethnic stereotypes. The young doctor, a [[typecasting (acting)|typical]] role for the young Sidney Poitier, was purposely created idealistically perfect, so that the only possible objection to his marrying Joanna would be his [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or the fact she had only known him for 10 days; the character has thus graduated from a top school, begun innovative medical initiatives in [[Africa]], refused to have premarital sex with his fiancée despite her willingness, and leaves money in an open container on his future father-in-law's desk in payment for a long-distance phone call he has made. Nothing is made of the 14-year difference in their ages. Kramer and Rose completed the film script in five weeks.&lt;ref name="Andersen295"&gt;Andersen, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer stated later that the principal actors believed so strongly in the premise that they agreed to act in the project even before seeing the script. Production had been set for January 1967 and ended on May 24, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 207, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Tracy was in poor health, and insurance companies refused to cover him. Kramer and Hepburn put their salaries in [[escrow]] so that if he died, filming could be completed with another actor. According to Kramer, "You're never examined for insurance until a few weeks before a picture starts. [Even] with all his drinking and ailments, Tracy always qualified for insurance before, so nobody thought it would be a problem in this case. But it was. We couldn't get insurance for Spence. The situation looked desperate. So then we figured out a way of handling it. Kate and I put up our own salaries to compensate for the lack of an insurance company for Spence. And we were allowed to proceed."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

The filming schedule was altered to accommodate Tracy's failing health.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 206-209&lt;/ref&gt; All of Tracy's scenes and shots were filmed between 9:00&amp;nbsp;am and noon of each day to give him adequate time to rest.&lt;ref name="Andersen295"/&gt; For example, most of Tracy's dialogue scenes were filmed in such a way that during close-ups on other characters, a stand-in was substituted for him.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's failing health was more serious than most people are aware of. According to Poitier:
"The illness of Spencer dominated everything. I knew his health was very poor and many of the people who knew what the situation was didn't believe we'd finish the film, that is, that Tracy would be able to finish the film. Those of us who were close knew it was worse than they thought. Kate brought him to and from the set. She worked with him on his lines. She made sure with [Stanley] Kramer that his hours were right for what he could do, and what he couldn't do was different each day. There were days when he couldn't do anything. There were days when he was great, and I got the chance to know what it was like working with Tracy."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, pp. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bust of Tracy sculpted by Hepburn herself was used as a prop, on the bookshelf behind the desk where Sidney Poitier makes his phone call. Tracy died two weeks after he completed his work on the film.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn significantly helped cast her niece, Katharine Houghton, for the role of Joey Drayton. Concerning this, Hepburn stated: "There was a lovely part for Kathy [Houghton], my niece [...] She would play Spencer's and my daughter. I loved that. She's beautiful and she definitely had a family resemblance. It was my idea."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, pp. 229-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hepburn, the role of Joey Drayton would be one of Houghton's first major roles as a young actress. "The part of my daughter," Kate said, "was a difficult one. A young unknown actress needs more opportunity to win the sympathy of the audience. Otherwise, too much has to depend on her youth, innocence, and beauty. She had one good speech to win the audience, but it was cut. Instead she only talks with her father about the differences between the principles he taught her and the way he's behaving."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poitier frequently found himself starstruck and as a result, a bit tongue-tied, in the presence of Hepburn and Tracy, whom he considered to be "giants" as far as acting is concerned.&lt;ref name="Poitier286"&gt;Poitier, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poitier reportedly found a way to overcome his nerves. "When I went to play a scene with Tracy and Hepburn, I couldn't remember a word. Finally, Stanley Kramer said to me, 'What are we going to do?' I said, 'Stanley, send those two people home. I will play the scene against two empty chairs. I don't want them here because I can't handle that kind of company.' He sent them home. I played the scene in close-up against two empty chairs as the dialogue coach read Mr. Tracy's and Miss Hepburn's lines from off camera."&lt;ref name="Poitier286"/&gt;

Given the tense nature of racism in the United States during the time of the film's production, Poitier felt he was "under close observation" by both Tracy and Hepburn during their first dinner meetings prior to production.&lt;ref&gt;Poitier, ''Measure of a Man'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he managed to swiftly win them over. Due to Tracy and Hepburn's close history with Kramer, Poitier cited that Hepburn and Tracy came to bear on him "the kind of respect they had for Kramer, and they had to say to themselves (and I'm sure they did), this kid has to be pretty okay, because Stanley is nuts about working with him".&lt;ref&gt;Poitier, ''Measure of a Man'', p. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered in theaters on January 1, 1968. The film falls into the genre of comedy drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1967/guess-whos-coming-to-dinner/ |title=amc filmcritic.com |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on VHS on December 12, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentpreviews.com/movie-reviews/guess-whos-coming-to-dinner/# |title=Parent Previews |publisher=One Voice Communications Ltd. |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the 20th anniversary of the original release. The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2001.&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes /&gt;

===Reception===
''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' was a box-office hit in 1968 throughout the United States, including in Southern states where it was traditionally assumed that few white filmgoers would want to see any film with black leads. The success of this film challenged that assumption in [[film marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''. Penguin Press, 2008, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this success, which included numerous film award nominations, [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in November 2008 that the film was frequently labeled as dated among liberals. Another main point of contention was the fact that Poitier's character, the golden future son-in-law, had no flaws and a resume of good deeds. Many people felt that the dynamic between the Draytons and Poitier's character would have inevitably resulted in a happily-ever-after film ending because Poitier's character was so perfect, respectable, likable, and proper. Some people went as far as saying Prentice was "too white" not to be accepted by the Draytons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rich | first1 = Frank | title = Guess Who's Coming to Dinner | journal = New York Times | page=10 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the film in the U.S. gave Poitier his third box-office success in six months in 1967,&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/guess_whos_coming_to_dinner/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which placed the race of Poitier's character at issue. The film grossed a total of $56.7 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In a 1986 review of the film by ''The New York Times'', [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] wrote: "the suspicion arises that were the film made today its makers would come to grips a good deal more bluntly with the problems of intermarriage. Still, this remains a deft comedy and - most of all - a paean to the power of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Gelder | first1 = Lawrence| title = HOME VIDEO; New Cassettes: Big Stars and Big Bands|journal = New York Times | page = 28 | year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant versions==
The original version of the film that played in theaters in 1968 contained a moment in which Tillie responds to the question "Guess who's coming to dinner now?" with the sarcastic one-liner: "The Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]?" After [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|King's assassination]] on April 4, 1968, this line was removed from the film, so by August 1968, almost all theaters' showings of this film had this line omitted. As early as 1969, the line was restored to many but not all prints, and the line was preserved in the VHS and DVD versions of the film, as well.

The plot explores similar themes to the 1958 play ''[[flame_in_the_Streets|Hot Summer Night]]'' by [[Ted_Willis,_Baron_Willis|Ted Willis]].

==Remakes==
[[Stanley Kramer]] produced and directed an unsold 30-minute [[television pilot]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] with the same title and premise in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Debolt, Abbe A. |editor2=Baugess, James S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-440-80102-9|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]] published the screenplay ''[[Tabu (2003 film)|Tabù]]'', an almost [[Wiktionary:verbatim|verbatim]] [[Parody film|parody]] of the film. In the variation, the engaged lovers are aged 40 (him) and 12 (her), and are brother and sister.&lt;ref name="Luttazzi03"&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]] (2003) ''La castrazione e altri metodi infallibili per prevenire l'acne'', Feltrinelli, pp. 155-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 film ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]'' starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Bernie Mac]] is a loose remake styled as a comedy rather than a drama, with the racial roles reversed: black parents are caught off-guard when their daughter brings home the young white man she has chosen to marry. Talking about the film, Bernie Mac told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2003, "Interracial dating is not that significant anymore." In the article, the writer cites that during the time at which the original movie was filmed, "interracial marriage was considered risky." Casting for Mac's remake of the film began in November 2003. Mac said of the script, "They want to make it a comedy, but I won't disrespect Spencer, Katharine or Sidney."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Karen | title = Bernie will be Spencer in new 'Coming to Dinner' | journal = USA Today | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish writer [[Roddy Doyle]] wrote a short story by the same title about an Irish girl who brings home an immigrant from Nigeria, published in 2008 in the collection ''[[The Deportees and Other Stories|The Deportees]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Erica|title=White Irish Need Not Apply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Wagner-t.html|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot is very similar to another film, ''[[Crossroads (1957 film)|Crossroads]]'', made by the Canadian director Don Haldane a decade earlier in 1957. In this film, a young white woman in Toronto surprises her mother with her black fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nfb.ca/2012/06/18/crossroads-interracial-marriage-toronto-1957/ What’s Black and White and Shocking All Over?] Carolyne Weldon, National Film Board of Canada Blog, June 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was referenced in a 1988 episode of the sitcom ''[[Designing Women]]'' by Suzanne, who mistakenly calls it, "There's Some Black People Comin' Over for Dinner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Reservations for Eight|series=Designing Women, Season 2|access-date=11 September 2017|series-no=2|number=22|minutes=30|quote="There's Some Black People Comin' Over for Dinner." |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode ''Guess Who's Coming to Marry'' (season 2, episode 6) of the [[black sitcom]] ''[[Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'', an aunt of the lead character introduces her fiancé, a white man, to the horror of her family.

'''''Illusion and Reality''''' is a book of [[Marxist literary criticism]] by [[Christopher Caudwell]] published in 1937.

==Overview==
''Illusion and Reality'' was written quickly during the summer of 1935, while Caudwell was in the process of a political conversion to [[Marxism]].  Portions of the manuscript were produced at a rate of 5,000 words a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1977/caudwell.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In its use of political theory and history the book was influenced by the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]], but it also was strongly indebted to the [[literary criticism]] of [[I. A. Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Pawling. ''Christopher Caudwell''. (1989) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Caudwell develops two main arguments in ''Illusion and Reality''. First, each unique era of British poetry ([[Romantic poetry|''The Romantic Period'']], ''The Age of Pope'', etc.) develops from a particular economic arrangement in [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society.  Caudwell writes:
::"When we use the word 'modern' in a general sense, we use it to describe a whole complex of culture which developed in Europe and spread beyond it from the fifteenth century to the present day.  There is something 'modern' in Shakespeare, Galileo, Michael Angelo {{sic}}, Pope, Goethe and Voltaire which we can distinguish from Homer, Thales, Chaucer and Beowulf, and compare with Valery, Cézanne, James Joyce, Bergson and Einstein.  This complex itself is changeful—no epoch of human history has been so variegated and dynamic as that from the Elizabethan age to ours.  But then, the economic foundations too have changed, from feudal to 'industrial'.  This culture complex is the superstructure of the bourgeois revolution in production—a revolution whose nature was first analyzed completely by Marx in ''Das Kapital''.  Modern poetry is ''capitalist'' poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Caudwell. ''Illusion and Reality''. p.48&lt;/ref&gt;
Caudwell, here, is working within the Marxist framework of [[base and superstructure]] and argues that both the poetic form and the content are determined by the economic base. To further illustrate this point ''Illusion and Reality'' includes a table that outlines the "General Characteristics" of the capitalist economy in Great Britain during ten different eras and their related [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] poetic forms, or "Technical Characteristics," from that same period. For example, Caudwell writes:
::{|
|-
!  !! '''General Characteristics''' !! '''Technical Characteristics'''
|-
| '''The Era of Mercantilism and Manufacture, 1688–1750''' || ''The Eighteenth Century''.--Pope The shortage of labour makes the bourgeoisie continue to ally itself with the agricultural capitalist (the Whig "aristocrat") in order to maintain the laws and restrictions which will keep down the price of labour through the stage of manufacture. Poetry reflects a belief in the rightness and permanence of forms and restrictions, good taste and upper-class "tone". || The outward "rules" are now accepted, not as a compromise but as obvious and rational ingredients of style, measure, polish and the antithesis which restrains natural luxuriance.  Vocabulary becomes formalised and elegantly fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Caudwell. ''Illusion and Reality''. p.129&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
The table provides an outline for the historical progression of forms that Caudwell examines in ''Illusion and Reality'' and exemplifies the connection Caudwell sees between poetry and economic social relations.

Caudwell's second major claim is that the act of creating poetry is a response by human instincts to the unfavorable conditions of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] life.  In this argument, Caudwell modifies the Freudian understanding of the creative process through [[Karl Marx|Marx]].

==Criticism==

===Early reviews===
''Illusion and Reality'' was published shortly after [[Christopher Caudwell|Caudwell's]] death and was welcomed by Marxist critics who viewed Caudwell as something of a martyr.  Among the non-Marxist literary establishment it received little notice.

===1950–1951 Caudwell controversy===
In the Winter (1950–51) issue of [[Modern Quarterly (British journal)|The Modern Quarterly]], [[Maurice Cornforth]] published an article that challenged Caudwell's opinion of poetry—particularly as it appeared in ''Illusion and Reality''.  Cornforth argued that Caudwell's theory of poetry was  idealized, dependent on a [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] concept of pre-social 'instincts' that was incompatible with [[Marxism]].  George Thompson answered Cornforth in the next issue (Spring 1951) by reaffirming ''Illusion and Reality'''s contribution to [[Literary criticism]].  The next two issues (Summer and Autumn) saw the publication of another twelve responses, all differing on the value of Caudwell's theory.  Further responses were also published in journals in both Great Britain and the United States. The debate provoked a re-evaluation of ''Illusion and Reality'' and 'The Caudwell Controversy' became an important intellectual moment in the evolution of the [[History of socialism in Great Britain|British Socialist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1977/caudwell.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later criticism===
As Marxist Literary theory underwent a 'cultural turn,' ''Illusion and Reality'' was increasingly seen as dogmatic and rigid in its discussion of bourgeois poetry.  The debate shifted away from its use of Freudian concepts to its ties with [[Stalinism|Stalinist Marxism]].   In [[Culture and Society]] (1958), [[Raymond Williams]] said of ''Illusion and Reality'' that it had "little to say of actual literature that is even interesting" and that the book "is not even specific enough to be wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. ''Culture and Society'' (1958) p.272&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Terry Eagleton]] remarked about Caudwell in 1976 that "there is little, except negatively, to be learnt from him."&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, "Raymond Williams: an Appraisal," ''New Left Review'', 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[E. P. Thompson]], one of Caudwell's most generous late-interpreters, argued that the status of ''Illusion and Reality''  should be downgraded among Caudwell's works  in favor of [[Studies in a Dying Culture]] (1938).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1977/caudwell.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  From the late 1950s until the late 1980s, ''Illusion and Reality'' was equated with [[Orthodox Marxism|vulgar Marxism]].  However, Christopher Pawling's 1989 book on Caudwell sought to restore the reputation of ''Illusion and Reality'' by suggesting that it belongs to what Raymond Williams called an "[[Western Marxism|alternative Marxist tradition]]" that included [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[György Lukács]], and [[Lucien Goldmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Pawling. ''Christopher Caudwell''. (1989) p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}
'''Korean theatre''' is theatre performances were originally done in courtyards although have now moved to stages. It is performed in the Korean language and is generally made up of those of Korean descent. Rising to prominence in ancient Korea, Korean theatre remains vibrant today and is now gaining popularity around the world.

Korean theatre before the 20th century was more 'performance' than 'drama'. There was no plot-driven drama, and all the performative presentations, including dance, shaman ritual, and circus were called ''Nolum'' (놀음) or ''Yeonhee'' (연희), which means 'playing'.
	
Up till the 19th century, the leading form of Korean public theatre was ''[[Talchum]]'' (탈춤) and ''[[Pansori]]'' (판소리). Talchum literally means mask-dance. Multiple players wearing masks performed a loosely fixed text through dance, dialogue and song. Since the performers were able to conceal their identities, many of the plays that were played were satires. Pansori is a form of storytelling. There is one central performer who, through dialogue and song goes through a whole story and another performer who adds rhythm and mood to the story by beating on a drum and putting in verbal sounds (‘chuimsae’-추임새). Neither Talchum nor Pansori had a fixed script – they were handed down orally from generation to generation. 
	
After Korea opened its doors to the foreign countries in the late 19th century, the first modern indoor theater, [[Hyopyul-sa]](협률사) was built in 1902, and the ‘new plays’ (신극) started to come through. ‘New plays’ was the term Korean thespians used for the Western drama at that time. The proscenium stage was introduced as well as Shakespeare, and there was a movement among the theatre practitioners to define a line between the traditional Korean theatre and the new wave. Nowadays the traditional forms are continued by the "living national treasures"; people who are selected by the government for having exceptional skill in a traditional art and are funded to pass it down. 
	
Contemporary Korean theatre has three main directions. First there are the government funded theatres such as The National Theatre and Seoul Performing Arts Center. The main repertory consists of Korean traditional theatre and classics such as Shakespeare and Chekhov. The second direction happens at Daehakro (대학로), the ‘off-Broadway’ or ‘off-off-Broadway’ of Seoul, Korea. Most of the theatre that takes place in Daehakro is independent and experimental. The last but largest direction is that of the popular theatre. Many corporate companies have built big theatre spaces in Seoul that are mainly used to stage big musicals and translations of Broadway hits. But whereas these three categories can give one an idea about contemporary Korean theatre, one also needs to keep in mind that the three often intermingle, so sometimes you find experimental theatre at a corporate theatre and a Broadway musical on Daehakro. 
Korean theatre has spread across the world and is rising to prominence in other countries such as Australia, U.S.A and England. Oftentimes themes include modernized and revised versions of traditional Korean plays mixed with melodrama.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rulebooks}}
This is a '''list of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rulebooks''' for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], sorted by the edition of the game that they appeared in. This list does not include books designed for use as premade [[adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|adventures]].

* ''Volume 1: Men &amp; Magic''
* ''Volume 2: Monsters &amp; Treasure''
* ''Volume 3: Underworld &amp; Wilderness Adventures''
This original version of ''D&amp;D'' only included a few of the elements considered core to modern ''D&amp;D'' and required the player to own several other games in order to make full use of the rules, however it is considered the first of what is now considered role-playing games and, along with its supplements, is responsible for the creation of the genre itself.

==''Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==

The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set]]'' was the successor to original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and was released while [[TSR, Inc.]] was working on the ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set. This set was the beginning of the split into two separate games, driven by disagreements on the direction the game should take. The Basic set retained the simplicity and flexibility of the original game while [[Gary Gygax]] took ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in a more structured and complicated direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html| title = ''Acaeum: Basic Set''| accessdate = 2010-08-19| publisher = Acaeum| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acaeum.com%2Fddindexes%2Fsetpages%2Fbasic.html&amp;date=2010-08-19| archivedate = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially it was expected that players would start using Basic edition and then graduate to ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax &amp; Arneson (1977) p. 6. states "...experience levels that high are not discussed in this book and the reader is referred to the more complete rules in ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS"&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1981 the ''Basic Set'' underwent a complete revision and not long after this the ''Expert Set'' was released for the first time. All references to a progression from the ''Basic Set'' to ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' were removed from the games and supplements as [[TSR, Inc.]] made clear that the expected progression was from the Basic Set to the Expert Set.  From this point the ''D&amp;D'' dichotomy became fixed and the ''Basic/Expert'' pair were considered a completely separate game from ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/expert.html| title = ''Acaeum: Expert Set''| accessdate = 2010-08-19| publisher = Acaeum| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acaeum.com%2Fddindexes%2Fsetpages%2Fexpert.html&amp;date=2010-08-19| archivedate = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''==
''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''AD&amp;D'') greatly expanded upon the rules and settings of the original ''D&amp;D'' game when it was released in 1977.  As such, this edition saw the publication of numerous books to assist players. The naming of the core books in this edition became the standard for all later editions.

Around 1983, books such as ''MM'', ''PHB'', ''DMG'' and ''DDG'', all previous hardcover releases except ''Fiend Folio'', were upgraded with new cover art and unified in "orange spine" look. This included only minimal text change such as removal of rape references in ''DMG'' (books are now labeled "ages 10 and up"). ''MM2'' and the rest of the series followed the same format. By the end of its first decade, ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' line had expanded to a library of 14  hardcover rulebooks, including three books of monsters, and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings.

==''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition==
In 1989, [[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition|''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition]] was published. Initially, the second edition would consolidate the game, with two essential hardcovers and a 3-ring monster document binder that [[Dungeon Master]]s can sort contents as they wish. Periodically, [[TSR (company)|TSR]] published 3 lines of optional rulebooks (PHBR/DMGR/HR) and additional monster compendium to enhance game play.

However, by popular demand TSR released a hardcover monster book in 1993. Also by 1995, with [[Glossary of video game terms#Power creep|power creep]] from optional classes and races becoming prominent, they were forced to abandon their original plan and revise the entire line.&lt;ref&gt;''[[30 Years of Adventure|30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', Wizards of the Coast, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7869-3498-0}} pp.171-175&lt;/ref&gt; Core rules were rewritten, reorganized and accompanied with new logo, new art and black bordered cover style but had only a few meaningful rule changes. Optional rules were also revised and reorganized in hardcover books in the same look.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition and v3.5==
A major revision of the ''AD&amp;D'' rules was released in 2000. As the Basic game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "Advanced" was dropped and the new edition was called just ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', but was still officially referred to as [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|3rd edition]] (or 3E for short).

This edition was the first to be released by [[Wizards of the Coast]] after their acquisition of the company, as well as the first to allow third-party companies to make supplemental materials by use of the [[Open Game License]]. A series of [[Map Folio]]s were also produced.

In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition ''D&amp;D'' rules (termed [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons version 3.5|version 3.5]]) was released that incorporated numerous rule changes, as well as expanding the ''Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual''.

The '''United Nations Secretary-General''' is the head of the [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], one of the principal divisions of the [[United Nations]]. Many of the individuals who have served as the world body's top office have written memoirs, either before, during or after their terms of office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9594">Some of these '''horn techniques''' are not unique to the [[French horn|horn]], but are applicable to most or all wind instruments.''

== Stopped horn ==
This is the act of fully closing off the bell of the instrument with either the right hand or a special [[Mute (music)#Stop (stopping)|stopping mute]]. This results in producing a somewhat nasal sound. When required, in the sheet music the usual notation is a '+' above the note followed by a 'o' above notes that are to be played open. For longer stopped passages, the word  indicating a stopped horn is written out.

The pitch lowers gradually when the hand is placed in the bell and slowly moved inward.  When the bell is completely covered (stopped), the pitch falls to a half-step above the next lower [[Harmonic series (music)|partial]] (harmonic). For example, playing a middle C (F-horn, open) and gradually covering the bell into stopped horn, the pitch will lower a major 3rd to A{{music|flat}} (or 1/2 step above G, the next lower partial). However, playing a 3rd space C (F-horn, open) and repeating the stopped horn, the pitch will lower a half-step to a B-natural (or 1/2 step above B{{music|flat}}, the next lower partial).  The hand horn technique developed in the classical period, with music pieces requiring the use of covering the bell to various degrees to lower the pitch accordingly. [[Mozart]]'s [[Horn Concertos (Mozart)|four Horn Concertos]], [[Concert Rondo]] and Morceau de Concert were written with this technique in mind, as was the music both [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]] wrote for the horn. 

Some modern composers have incorrectly notated that the horn is to bend an open pitch upward to a stopped pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Norman del Mar, Anatomy of the Orchestra p244&lt;/ref&gt; This is impossible. The horn pitch can only be bent downward into a stopped pitch. It is believed that players play the next harmonic higher without realising and this has given rise to this erroneous belief.

There is also an effect that is occasionally called for, usually in French music, called "echo horn", "hand mute" or "''sons d'écho''" (see [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'') which is like stopped horn, but different in that the bell is not closed as tightly.  The player closes the hand enough so that the pitch drops 1/2 step, but, especially in the middle register, this is not closed as tightly as for stopped horn. Consequently, when playing echo horn, the player fingers one half step higher.

Also, the hand can be partially inserted into the bell in such a fashion as to lower the pitch of the horn one [[quarter tone]], an [[extended technique]] used in some modern compositions today.

== Handhorn technique ==
Before the advent of the valve horn, a player would increase the number of playable notes beyond the normal [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] by changing the position of his/her hand in the [[bell (wind instrument)|bell]]. It is possible to use a combination of stopping, hand-muting (3/4 stopping), and half-stopping (to correct notes that would otherwise be out of tune) to play almost every note of a mid-range [[chromatic scale]] on one fingering. Most modern pieces for hand-horn tend to spend more time in the higher ranges, as there are more notes that can be played naturally (without altering hand position and maintaining pure tone) above the 8th note of any harmonic series. The most well known natural hornist virtuoso who was in the classical period was [[Giovanni Punto]], which is said to have been able to play 'anything' on his natural horn

== Transposition ==
Many older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern orchestra hornists is to be able to read music directly in these keys. This is most commonly done by [[transposition (music)|transposing]] the music on the fly into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, F, G, and occasionally A) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.

Commonly seen transpositions include:

* '''B{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''A''' — up a [[major third]]
* '''G''' — up a [[major second]]
* '''E''' — down a [[minor second]]
* '''E{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major second]] (used for horn on pitches with multiple sharps until Richard Strauss)
* '''D''' — down a [[minor third]]
* '''C''' — down a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''B{{music|flat}} basso''' — down a [[perfect fifth]]

Some less common transpositions include:
* '''A{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[minor third]] (used in Schubert`s 4th symphony, 2nd movement)
* '''F{{music|sharp}}''' — up a [[minor second]]
* '''D{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major third]] (used in some works by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]])
* '''B''' — down a [[tritone]] (used by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]])


It has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B(♮) was to encourage the horn players to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns and wrote all his horn parts playable for natural horn, same as [[Carl Maria von Weber]] did.

Sometimes it is unclear as to whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B{{music|flat}} alto versus B{{music|flat}} basso when only B{{music|flat}} is written). Various factors can be taken into account when choosing e.g. which direction keeps the music in the horn's normal range. Also the history of the composer can be used. For Haydn symphonies which include trumpet parts, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise, the high transposition is usually correct. Sometimes multiple pitches were used to get a greater number of available tones. This is especially true for works in minor keys to be able to play the minor third (e.g. [[Symphony_No._40_(Mozart)|Mozart Symphony Nr. 40]])

== Double and triple tonguing ==
Normal tonguing consists of interrupting the air stream by tapping the back of the front teeth with the tongue as said in the syllables 'da', 'ta', 'doo', or 'too'. Double tonguing consists of alternating between the 'ta' and the 'ka' sounds or between the 'da' and 'ga' sounds.  The tongue makes the same movement as if the player is repeatedly saying 'kitty' or 'ticket.'  Triple tonguing is most used for patterns of three notes and is made with the syllables 'ta-ta-ka', 'ta-ka-ta', or 'da-ga-da.'

== Lip trill ==

A lip trill is a rapid oscillation between neighboring harmonics - used primarily for whole-step trills from second-line G up approximately an octave.  Lip trills are possible both lower and higher, but much lower than E and the harmonics are too far apart for a whole step, and much higher and harmonics are too narrow. Many books give fingering charts for lip trills, but the double horn gives further options. In his book "The Horn", Barry Tuckwell also gives a fingering chart of possible 'faux' 1/2 step lip trills.

== Multiphonics ==
[[Multiphonics]] is the act of producing more than one pitch simultaneously on the horn. To do this, one note is produced as normal while another is sung. One of its earliest uses occurs in the [[Concertino for Horn and Orchestra (Weber)|Concertino for Horn and Orchestra]] by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (Norman del Mar believed these chords to be impossible to play &lt;ref&gt;Norman Del Mar, Anatomy of the orchestra p260&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another kind of multiphonics can be achieved by simultaneously playing two neighbouring notes of the harmonic series.

== Circular breathing ==
Information on this subject can be found at the article on [[circular breathing]].

== Quick valve water emptying ==
Horns tend to fill with water. It may appear that all of the valve tubes will require disassembling. By holding the horn so the bell is up in the air, holding down the third valve and flipping the first and second while rotating the horn back to the normal position, all of the water in the valves is now in the third valve tubings.

== Fake high C ==
On some horns, depending on the type of valves fitted, a high F' (concert pitch) can sound out while pressing the first valve of the F side down halfway.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Fake high D ==
A high D can be obtained by pulling out completely the first tuning slide of the F-horn.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Slide lubrication ==
Normally expensive slide greases are used to lubricate the slides. Sometimes petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) is used in lieu. This is not a recommended practice since the rotary valve oil can dissolve and wash the jelly into the valves. Anhydrous lanolin is considered a better alternative.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Hollywood iO West Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[I.O. West]] theater, the site of the [[Los Angeles Improv Comedy Festival]].]]
'''Improvisational-theater festivals''', also known as '''improv-comedy festivals''' or '''improv festivals''', are venues where multiple [[List of improvisational theatre companies|improvisational-theater groups]] perform.

They are usually not limited by improvisational style, though they may limit entrants to professional-only or collegiate-only.

Most [[improvisational theater|improvisational-theater]] festivals are hosted by a single troupe, but others are hosted by conglomerations of troupes or a company set up solely for that given festival.

'''Dame Madge Kendal''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}}&lt;!-- leave DBE; do not add GBE; see talk page --&gt; (born '''Margaret Shafto Robertson'''; 15 March 1848 – 14 September 1935) was an English actress of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] eras, best known for her roles in [[Shakespeare]] and English comedies. Together with her husband, [[William Hunter Kendal|W. H. Kendal]], she became an important theatre manager.

==Early years==
Kendal was born in [[Cleethorpes]], reportedly the youngest of 22 children of Margharetta Elisabetta Robertson (née Marinus; died 1876), a native of [[Denmark]], and her English husband, William Robertson (died 1872), who joined his wife's family of actors and became their manager in 1830. One of Kendal's brothers was [[Thomas William Robertson|T.W. Robertson]], a dramatist who led the movement toward naturalistic acting and design in theatre.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb&gt;Foulkes, Richard. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34274 "Kendal, Dame Madge (1848–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 27 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One of her sisters, Fanny Robertson, was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Stagebeauty&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/kendal/kendal-m2.html Profile of Madge Kendal], stagebeauty.net, accessed 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kendal was [[home-schooled]] by a governess and her father, who read Shakespeare to her from an early age.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;Mrs. Alec-Tweedie (1904) ''Behind the Footlights'', Dodd Mead and Co., New York&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1854, Kendal had her first speaking role as Marie in the drama ''The Struggle for Gold'' by [[Edward Stirling]] under her father's management.  She next appeared with her family as a blind girl, Jeannie, in the stage adaptation of ''The Seven Poor Travellers'' by [[Charles Dickens]]. Her family was engaged by in [[Bristol]] the next year, where Kendal played in an adaptation of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' as Eva. Although she sang well as a child, she contracted [[diphtheria]], and her voice suffered after the removal of her tonsils. Nevertheless, she played a singing role in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', with songs by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], at the Bath Theatre in 1863, starring sisters [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]] and [[Kate Terry]] as [[Titania]] and [[Oberon]], respectively. Throughout this period, she performed with her family in Bristol and [[Bath, England|Bath]].&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

In 1865, Kendal was playing adult roles in London, beginning with [[Ophelia]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Blanche in ''King John'' and [[Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.  She was Mary Meredith in ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' with [[Edward Askew Sothern|Sothern]], and Pauline to his Claud Melnotte. But her most notable early successes were at the Haymarket in Shakespearian revivals and the old English comedies. At the Haymarket, she starred with and met her future husband, [[William Hunter Kendal|W. H. Kendal]], whom she married in 1869. Kendal played Rosalind, Lady Teazle, Lydia Languish and Kate Hardcastle, while her husband played [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]], Charles Surface, Jack Absolute and Young Marlowe. The two thereafter acted mostly together. She then toured the provinces, joining the playwright and theatre manager [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]]&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6fU_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt; and the actor [[Samuel Phelps]] in 1866 at the Theatre Royal, Hull.  She substituted in the role of [[Lady Macbeth]], for an actress who was ill, opposite Phelps, who engaged her to appear as Lady Teazle at the Standard Theatre, [[Shoreditch]], opposite his Sir Peter in ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. During the following years, her reputation grew during engagements with F. B. Chatterton at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], [[E. A. Sothern]] at the Haymarket, and [[John Hollingshead]] at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], London, as well as provincial appearances.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

==Peak years==
[[Image:Pygmalion and Galatea.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Kendals in ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', 1872]]
In 1868, Kendal joined the company of [[J. B. Buckstone]] on tour and then at the Haymarket, continuing with this troupe until 1874.  She married William Hunter Grimston, an actor in the company who appeared under the name [[W. H. Kendal]], on 7 August 1869, and adopted his stage name. With Buckstone's company, Madge Kendal enjoyed a string of successes, usually opposite her husband, playing as Lilian Vavasour in ''New Men and Old Acres'' by [[Tom Taylor]] (1869), Lydia Languish in ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1870), Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1871),&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt; and a series of "fairy comedies" by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including Princess Zeolide in ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), Galatea in ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1871), Selene in ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873) and the Lady Hilda in ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), and Mrs Van Brugh in his drama ''[[Charity (play)|Charity]]'' (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Kendal played at the [[Opera Comique]] and the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], which they managed for a time before joining the company of the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  There, she played Dora in ''Diplomacy'' by [[B. C. Stephenson]] and [[Clement Scott]] (1878, adapted from [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Dora''), among other roles.  Between 1879 and 1888, Kendal and her husband managed the [[St. James's Theatre]] with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] and presented a large number of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] plays, among many others.  Mrs. Kendal played Lady Giovanna in ''The Falcon'' by [[Tennyson]] (1879), Susan in ''William and Susan'', Kate Verity in ''The Squire'' by Pinero (1881), repeated her Rosalind in ''As You Like It'' (1885).  The Kendals restored the St. James's to popularity and helped to improve the respectability of the Victorian theatre, which had fallen into disrepute among the middle classes.  They imposed a high moral code both on stage and behind the scenes.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

[[File:Falstaff and the Wives.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration for 1902 revival, featuring [[Ellen Terry]] as Mistress Page, Kendal as Mistress Ford, and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Falstaff]]
Some of the Kendals' other notable successes in the 1880s included ''The Squire'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], ''Impulse'' by [[B. C. Stephenson]], ''The Ironmaster'', an English version by Pinero of ''Le Maitre des Forges'' by [[Georges Ohnet]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0711FD3F5E1A738DDDA10994D8415B8984F0D3 "Amusements – 'The Ironmaster{{'"}}], ''The New York Times'', 18 October 1889&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scrap of Paper'' by [[John Palgrave Simpson]], an adaptation of ''Les Pattes de mouche'' by Sardou. In 1888, the Hare and Kendal partnership ended. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote of her 1886 performance in ''The Greatest of These'' by [[Sydney Grundy]] at the [[Garrick Theatre]], "her finish of execution, her individuality and charm of style, her appetisingly witty conception of her effects, her mastery of her art and of herself … are all there, making her still supreme among English actresses in high comedy."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, George Bernard. ''The Saturday Review'', 10 June 1886&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Kendal learned of the case of [[Joseph Merrick]], referred to as the Elephant Man. Although she probably never met him in person, she helped to raise funds and public sympathy for him. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft, and she arranged for him to see a Christmas [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell, pp. 109–112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
The Kendals made their American debut in ''A Scrap of Paper'' in 1889, and the success of their first tour in the United States was repeated in several successive American seasons, where they spent most of the next five years. In 1902, she appeared as Mistress Ford opposite the Mistress Page of her childhood friend [[Ellen Terry]] in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company. The Kendals continued to appear in popular plays without interruption until 1908, when they both retired, though Mrs Kendal reprised her Mistress Ford at the coronation gala of 1911 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

The Kendals had five children, but they reportedly were estranged from them. Her husband died in 1917. In retirement, Madge Kendal became active with many theatre charities, becoming president of the actors' retirement home, [[Denville Hall]]. She was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in 1926.

Kendal died at her home in [[Chorleywood]], Hertfordshire, in 1935, aged 87, after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 16 September 1935&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at [[East Finchley Cemetery|St Marylebone cemetery]] in [[East Finchley]].

==In fiction==
Kendal is a featured character in the 1979 play ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-elephant-man-3938 ''The Elephant Man''], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the unrelated 1980 [[The Elephant Man (film)|film of the same name]], both based on the life of [[Joseph Merrick]]. In the film, Kendal was portrayed by [[Anne Bancroft]].

'''''Neverending Nightmares''''' is a [[video game]] developed by Infinitap Games. It is a [[horror game]] drawing inspiration from the lead designer Matt Gilgenbach's personal struggles with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]];&lt;ref name=Personal_inspiration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/23/4529198/neverending-nightmares-retro-grade-matt-gilgenbach|last=McElroy|first=Justin|title=The Neverending Nightmare of Retro/Grade creator Matt Gilgenbach|work=[[Polygon (website)]]|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an interview, he stated that he was "trying to create that feeling [of bleakness and hopelessness] in ''Neverending Nightmares''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=VanOrd|first1=Kevin|title=Neverending Nightmares: How OCD Inspired a Psychological Horror Breakthrough|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/neverending-nightmares-how-ocd-inspired-a-psychological-horror-breakthrough/1100-6414083/|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of Thomas, a man who "wakes up" from one nightmare and into another. As the player navigates Thomas throughout the game, the nightmares become progressively worse and worse, including the horrifying monsters that lurk within them. Each time Thomas dies in a nightmare, comes across some serious cause of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or commits [[self-harm]], he will "wake up" again in either the same nightmare as before, or into a different one. This acts as the game's [[Checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]] and [[Saved game|save system]]. The game contains a total of three different endings, all influenced by the player's choices or paths that they take.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The game features a 2D hand-drawn [[line art]] style heavily influenced by the works of [[Edward Gorey]].&lt;ref name=Edward_Gorey_influence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Neverending-Nightmares-Horror-Game-Channels-Art-Edward-Gorey-58923.html|last=Usher|first=William|title=Neverending Nightmares Is A Horror Game That Channels The Art Of Edward Gorey|work=Gaming Blend|date=8 September 2013|accessdate= 3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a [[minimalism|minimalist]] [[user interface]], forgoing onscreen prompts and loading screens during play in order to increase [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/id/StacheSplosion/recommended/253330/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
''Neverending Nightmares'' revolves around Thomas Smith, a young man who is suffering from a seemingly-endless string of [[nightmare]]s (hence the title). Another character, Gabby, is introduced as Thomas' little sister, and frequently appears in his nightmares, occasionally changing roles. At turning points in the game, Thomas finds Gabby dead in various situations; Thomas himself also dies in his nightmares, sometimes [[suicide|by his own hand]], though this only leads him to wake up in yet another nightmare.

Throughout the game, which is implied to be set in the late 1800s, Thomas must explore various locations in his nightmares. These include a [[mansion]], a [[cemetery]], an [[insane asylum]], a [[forest]], and a [[hospital]].

===Story===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
The game begins with Thomas "waking up" from a nightmare, in which he had stabbed his younger sister Gabby in the stomach. As he wanders through each nightmare, "waking up" in a bed each time, the player sees Thomas commit gruesome acts of [[self-harm]] out of depression, such as pulling a [[blood vessel]] or even a bone out of his arm.

Depending on the player's actions, Thomas will finally wake up into one of three different endings.
* '''Wayward Dreamer''': after waking up, a young Thomas goes to Gabby's room, where he kisses his sleeping sister good-night.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xke58wkC4vE&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Destroyed Dreams''': after escaping a nightmarish version of himself, Thomas slowly awakens in a hospital, his arms bandaged and bloody. Gabby, either as his sister or wife, begs him to wake up, and rejoices when he finally does.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"/&gt;
* '''The Final Descent''': an adult Thomas wakes up at his desk, where he reads a letter from Gabrielle, his wife. After the loss of their daughter, Gabrielle was forced to leave Thomas, as he couldn't get over the tragedy. After reading the letter, Thomas quietly weeps in his chair. A portrait on the wall implies that the girl murdered at the beginning was his daughter, not Gabrielle.&lt;ref name="dev diary 213"/&gt;

== Development ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
In September 2013, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for the game's development was successfully funded, raising $106,722 of its original $99,000 goal.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter_funding&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitap/neverending-nightmares|last=Gilgenbach|first=Matt|title=Neverending Nightmares Kickstarter|accessdate=3 June 2014|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[Ouya]] on September 26, 2014.&lt;ref name="Neverending_Nightmares_Release" /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Pre-release ===
''Neverending Nightmares'' received largely positive buzz during the course of its development. [[Adam Sessler]] said it was "very, very interesting" after playing an early build at the [[Penny Arcade Expo]]. He compared it to ''[[Gone Home]]'' in how it told a story personally relevant to its creator.&lt;ref name="sessler"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sessler |first=Adam |interviewer= Meg Turney |title= Pax Prime 2013 Favorites with Adam Sessler |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VfiMxGgHDo|location= Seattle, WA |date= 2013-09-02|work=SourceFed Nerd |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] included it on a list of its most anticipated horror games for 2014, emphasizing its "wonderfully-distinct, pen-and-ink style."&lt;ref name="ign-horror"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/29/13-horror-games-not-to-turn-your-back-on-in-2014 | title = 13 Horror Games Not To Turn Your Back On In 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Krupa | accessdate = 2014-06-08 | date = 2013-01-29 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated by [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] as one of the best games of [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Escapist's Best of E3 2014 Nominations|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/conferences/e32014/11678-The-Escapists-Best-of-E3-2014-Nominations.6|website=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad.

Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare. So it is possible that Muayyad was a sobriquet for Zaki or part of his name (like Muayyad al-Din Zaki).

Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provided no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140–46) and that his background was urban.

The verse (quoted on p. 14): "I am lost as a pearl in the sea of Ganja, yet I am from the Qohestan of the city of Qom ", does not expressly mean that he was born in Qom.

Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.

В частности, в 1938 г. Низами в связи с его 800-летним юбилеем был объявлен гениальным азербайджанским поэтом (История, 1939. С. 88–91). На самом деле он был персидским поэтом, что и неудивительно, так как городское население в те годы было представлено персами (Дьяконов, 1995. С. 731). В свое время это признавалось всеми энциклопедическими словарями, выходившими в России, и лишь Большая Советская Энциклопедия впервые в 1939 г. объявила Низами "великим азербайджанским поэтом" (Ср. Брокгауз и Ефрон, 1897. С. 58; Гранат, 1917. С. 195; БСЭ, 1939. С. 94). Translation from Russian: "By that time, already mentioned Iranian and Armenian factors contributed to the rapid azerbaijanization of historical heroes and historical political entities on the territory of Azerbaijan. In particular, in 1938, Nizami in connection with his 800-year anniversary was declared a genius(marvelous) Azerbaijani poet (History, 1939. pp. 88–91). In fact, he was a Persian poet, which is not surprising, because the urban population in those years was Persian (Dyakonov, 1995. page. 731). At one time it was recognized by all Encyclopedic Dictionaries of published in Russia, and only the Big Soviet Encyclopedia for the first time in 1939, announced Nizami as a "Great Azerbaijani poet" (Sr. Brockhaus and Efron, 1897. page. 58; Garnet, 1917. page. 195 ; BSE, 1939. p. 94)".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpt: "Indeed, the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers, which in many ways inaugurated high Stalinism as a cultural paradigm, was a curiously solemn parade of old-fashioned romantic nationalisms. Pushkin, Tolstoy and other officially restored Russian icons were not the only national giants of international stature – all Soviet peoples possessed, or would shortly acquire, their own classics, their own founding fathers and their own folkloric riches. The Ukrainian delegate said that Taras Shevchenko was a "genius"and a "colossus" "whose role in the creation of the Ukrainian literary language was no less important than Pushkin's role in the creation of the Russian literary language, and perhaps even greater."The Armenian delegate pointed out that his nation's culture was "one of the most ancient cultures of the orient,"that the Armenian national alphabet predated Christianity and that the Armenian national epic was "one of the best examples of world epic literature"because of "the lifelike realism of its imagery, its elegance, the profundity and simplicity of its popular wisdom and the democratic nature of its plot."The Azerbaijani delegate insisted that the Persian poet Nizami was actually a classic of Azerbaijani literature because he was a "Turk from Giandzha" and ..."

Excerpt: "The attempt to 'annex' an important part of Persian literature and to transform it into 'Azerbaidzhani literature' can be best exemplified by the way in which the memory of the great Persian poet Nizami (1141—1203) is exploited in the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a ‘poet of the Soviet Union’, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic. The Soviet regime proclaims its ownership over Nizami also by ‘interpreting’ his works in accordance with the general pattern of Soviet ideology. Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's ‘great merit’ consisted in having undermined Islam by ‘opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world’.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter. In a talk with the Ukrainian writer, Mikola Bazhan, Stalin referred to Nizami as ‘the great poet of our brotherly Azerbaidzhani people’who must not be surrendered to Iranian literature, despite having written most of his poems in Persian."

===Family===
Nezami was married three times.  His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's "most beloved" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and "apple of my eyes". In "Haft Peykar" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.

Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that ''Afaq'' was the real name of his wife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location= Yerevan |year=2012 |pages= 173–175 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |title=ON THE MODERN POLITICIZATION OF THE PERSIAN POET NEZAMI GANJAVI: Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh: Free Download &amp; Streaming: Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have taken the ''Afaq'' in that verse to simply mean "horizon" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, "God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!".&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Bashiri,[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Teahouse/Figures.html#Nizami "The Teahouse at a Glance" – Nizami's Life and Works], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Nezami was not a philosopher&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Mehdi Amin Razavi, "The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia", RoutledgeCurzon; annotated edition (July 4, 1996).  pp. 178–187&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of [[Avicenna]] or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi.  However, he is regarded as a philosopher&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; and gnostic&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as [[Qutb al-Din Shirazi]].&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;

Often referred to by the honorific Hakim ("the Sage"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style.  About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so.  His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[astrology]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[alchemy]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], Koranic exegesis, [[Islamic]] theory and [[law]], [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] myths and legends,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sutenly, "Visionary Rose: Metaphorical Application of Horticultural Practice in Persian Culture" in Michel Conan and W. John Kress, "Botanical progress, horticultural information and cultural changes", Dumbarton Oaks, 2007.  p. 12: "In a highly evocative tale he relates in the Makhzan al-Asrar ("Treasury of Secrets"), the twelfth-century Persian poet, Nizami whose oeuvre is an acknowledged repository of Iranian myths and legends, illustrates the way in which the rose was perceived in the Medieval Persian imagination"&lt;/ref&gt; history, [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[thought|esoteric thought]], music, and the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;  His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"&gt;Peter J. Chelkowski, "Mirror of the Invisible World", New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1975.
p. 1: "The culture of Nizami's Persia is renowned for its deep-rooted tradition and splendor. In pre-Islamic times, it had developed extraordinarily rich and exact means of expression in music, architecture, and daily life as well as in writing, although Iran, its center—or, as the poets believed, its heart—was continually overrun by invading armies and immigrants, this tradition was able to absorb, transform, and ultimately ocercome foreign intrusion. Alexander the Great was only one of many conquerors, to be seduced by the Persian way of life."
p. 2:"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived."
p. 6: "Nizami's strong character, his social sensibility, and his poetic genius fused with his rich Persian cultural heritage to create a new standard of literary achievement.  Using themes from the oral tradition and written historical records, his poems unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran", p. 9:"Probably no Persian writer has inspired succeeding generation of poets more than Nizami", p. 6: ""Khosrow and Shirin" proved to be a literary turning point not only for Nizami but for all of [[Persian poetry]].  Furthermore it was the first poem in Persian literature to achieve complete structural and artistic unity".  p. 2;"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived." p. 1: "By the end of the tenth century, Persian literature was world renowned; it was heralded from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus" pp2:"Few facts about the life of Nizami are certain.  Because he was not a court poet and it was his poetry rather than his life or his political connections that won him enduring fame, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties...".  p. 9: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled"&lt;/ref&gt; cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement.  Being a product of the Iranian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; and the whole ancient world.

The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]'' contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Šarvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Unlike other parts of Persia,  where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; [[Khaqani]]'s mother was a [[Nestorian Christian]], Mojir Baylqani's mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], and Nezami's mother was a [[Kurd]].&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;

By the end of the 10th century,&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt; Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus.  The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of [[Qatran Tabrizi]](1009–1072) who served in the courts of the [[Shaddadid]] and [[Rawadid]] dynasties.  Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the "Azerbaijan"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; or "Trans-Cacausian" school&lt;ref&gt;Rypka, Jan. "Poets and Prose Writers of the Late Saljuq and Mongol Periods", The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5, The Saljuq and Mongol Periods, ed., Published January 1968. Excerpt: "The school, which begins with Qatran (d. 1072), formed a well defined group of teachers and pupils of whom two, Khaqani and Nezami, were to exert a lasting development of their respective genre: Khaqani being the greatest exponent of the qasida and Nezami the most brilliant writer of romantic epics".&lt;/ref&gt; or "Tabriz School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"&gt;P. Chelkowski, "Literature in Pre-Safavid Isfahan", International Society for Iranian Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1/2. — Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. on behalf of International Society for Iranian Studies, 1974. — p. 112-131.) Quote: "The three main literary styles which follow each other consecutively are known as: Khurasani, Iraqi, and Hindi. The time spans of each style are equally flexible. Within these broad geographical divisions we then come across certain "literary schools" which reflect regional peculiarities and idiosyncrasies and are identified with smaller entities like provinces or towns. For example, there are: the Azerbayjani school, The Tabriz school, or the Shirvan school."&lt;/ref&gt; or "Shirvan School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"/&gt; or "Arranian Style"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/NozhatAl-majales|title=Nozhat al-Majales|first=|last=Author passed away 700 years ago|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tarnama.org/library/Nozhat.al-Majales.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of Persian poetry.  This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with "Khurasani" ("Eastern") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of [[technical terminology]] and [[Christian]] imagery, the presence of Persian&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Meneghini, “Saljuqs: Saljuqid Literature” in Encyclopedia Iranica. Excerpt:"The Saljuqs never governed the vast conquered territories as a centralized empire. The main power centers were Hamadān and Isfahan in the west, and Marv and Nišāpur (Nishapur) in the east, but their courts changed location several times over the decades. There were also branches of the Saljuq dynasty in Kermān, Syria, and in Anatolia, and the dynasty’s strong tendency towards decentralization led in the 12th century to the establishment of the atābak, or ‘parallel’ dynasties of Turkish slaves, put in government in some areas (Marāḡa, Tabriz, Shiraz, etc.) ‘external’ to the main centers of power. This phenomenon favored the development of a vigorous cultural life in cities such as Ray, Shiraz, and Yazd and especially in the urban centers of Azerbaijan and Arrān such as Tabriz and Šervān.” “With their capital, Šarvān (Šervān), in the lands of the eastern Caucasus, the Šarvānšāh dynasty also always maintained its independence from the Great Saljqus” “The geographical closeness of the territories subject to the Ildeguzids and those under the Šarvānšāh encouraged the flow of intellectuals and poets from one court to the other. It is also possible to speak of a certain similarity of inspiration and of style between the poets born and educated in these areas, to the point of defining them as belonging to the ‘Azerbaijan school’ (Rypka, Hist. Iran Lit., pp. 201–9). The complexity of the language and of the compositional techniques, the originality and multiplicity of the themes, the presence of Persian archaisms and, at the same time, a wide range of borrowings from Arabic vocabulary are among the stylistic features which are common to poets in this cultural context compared with other contemporaries closer to the Khorasani style.”&lt;/ref&gt; archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term "'Iraqi" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.&lt;ref&gt;De Bruijn, J.T.P. (1997), “Iran: Literature”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. IV:52–75.  excerpt: "“On the other hand he enriched the romantic mathnawi by using imagery of lyric poetry to the full, treating it with all the rhetorical ingenuity characteristic of the 'Iraqi style”"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Qizil Arslan Welcomes the Poet Nizami.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|[[Eldiguzids|Atabeg of Azerbaijan]] [[Qizil Arslan]] welcomes Nizami]]
The [[Seljuqs]] took control of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] from the [[Shaddadid]]s in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts.  In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture, art and poetry in their courts.  Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil cervants, merchants were in great demand and rival dynastines continue to vie for the service of Persian poets.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties including the [[Seljuqs]], [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|Eldiguzids]](who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), [[Shirvanshah]]s, the ruler of Ahar and [[Ahmadilis]].  Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the court life and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life.  Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties which list the names of events of the ruling families.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

According to Professor Chelkowski: ''It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)''.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"&gt;(Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:" in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma, 1977).
p. 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career.  In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."
p. 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators".
p. 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians".
p. 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well".
p. 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.
p. 22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)".
p. 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince – not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: ''who has decorated words like new bride''.  Nezami advises the son of the [[Shirvanshah]] to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed Gohrab. "Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing", Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has used the [[Shahnameh]] as a source in his three epics of "Haft Paykar", "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" and "Eskandar-nameh".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;

The story of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' also had an immense influence on Nezami.  Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from [[Ferdowsi]], but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=VIS O RĀMIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially noticeable in the Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.

The first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s "Hadikat al-Hakika".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers.

===Persian lyrical poetry===
Only a small corpus of his lyric poetry, mainly qaṣīdahs ("odes") and [[ghazals]] ("lyrics") have survived.  Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology [[Nozhat al-Majales]] (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani&lt;ref name="Nozhat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nozhat-al-majales |title=NOZHAT AL-MAJĀLES – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with 23 other poets from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]].  A famous [[ghazal]] of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:

{{cquote|
I went to the Tavern last night, but I was not admitted&lt;br /&gt;
I was bellowing yet nobody was listening to me&lt;br /&gt;
Either none of the wine-sellers were awake&lt;br /&gt;
Or I was a nobody, and no one opened the door for a Nobody&lt;br /&gt;
When more or less half of the night had passed&lt;br /&gt;
A shrewd, perfect man (rind) raised his head from a booth and showed his face&lt;br /&gt;
I asked him: “to open the door”, he told me: “go away, do not talk nonsense!&lt;br /&gt;
At this hour, nobody opens door for anybody&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a mosque where its doors are open any moment&lt;br /&gt;
Where you can come late and move quickly to the first row&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Tavern of Magians and rinds dwell here&lt;br /&gt;

===Quinary ("Panj Ganj" or "Khamsa")===
Nezami is best known for his five long narrative poems, which have been preserved.  He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life.  Nezami was a master of the ''[[Masnavi]]'' style (double-rhymed verses).  He wrote poetical works; the main one is the ''Panj Ganj'' (Persian: Five Treasures), also known by the Persian pronunciation of the Arabic word ''Khamsa'' ("Quintet" or "Quinary").  The first of his five 'Treasures', called ''The Storehouse of Mysteries'',&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"&gt;CHARLES-HENRI DE FOUCHÉCOUR, "IRAN:Classical Persian Literature" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by [[Sanai]] of Ghazna's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth.  The other ‘Treasures’ were medieval romances. Khusaw and Shirin, Bahrām-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Book of Kings,&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Leyli and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The ''Khamsa'' was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts in later centuries.  Examples include the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]], created for the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in the 1590s.

The ''Quinary'' (Five Treasures-Panj Ganj) includes the five Persian books of Nezami:

====Makhzan al-Asrar====
*'''Makhzan al-Asrar''' (Persian: مخزن الاسرار) "The Treasury of Mysteries" (1163) (some date it 1176)
The ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian [[distich]]s was dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan.  The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics.  Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name.&lt;ref name="JTP"&gt;JTP de Bruijn. Persian Sufi Poetry, An Introduction to the Mystical – Taylor and Francis (Routledge) 1997 pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical [[Homiletics]] style.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In a few chapters he address the duties of a King, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; rather than his royal patrons.  In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  There is no indication that these were [[Sufi]] vigils, but are used as a literally fantasy on the duty of spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry which had started with [[Sanai]] and was continued by others, in the first place by [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]].&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;

Not a romantic epic, "The Treasury of Mysteries" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Darab, Gholam Hossein. Treasury of Mysteries, translation of Makhzanol Asrar. (London:. Arthur Probsthain, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;  After this early work, Nezami turned into narrative poetry.

*'''Khosrow o Shirin'''(Persian: خسرو و شیرین) "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" (1177–1180)
A story of pre-Islamic&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; Persian origin which is found in the great epico-historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin |title=ḴOSROW O ŠIRIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story  chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother [[Qizil Arslan]].  It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II Parviz]] towards his Armenian&lt;ref name="eskandar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami |title=ESKANDAR-NĀMA OF NEŻĀMĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; princess [[Shirin]].  "Khusrow and Shirin" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) |title=FARHĀD (1) – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; They are eventually married, but eventually Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who finally falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The influence of [[Vis o Ramin]] is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Rāmin, as well as being in the same meter ([[hazaj meter|''hazaj'']]) as Gorgāni's poem.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Rāmin.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"/&gt;  With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

====Layli o Majnun====
*'''Layli o Majnun'''(Persian: لیلی و مجنون) "[[Layla and Majnun]]" (1192)

A story of Arabic origin&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=LEYLI O MAJNUN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;  The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's "Seven Beauties"(Haft Paykar).  The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public.  The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet "the possessed" (Majnun).&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts.  However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep.  His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband.  Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact.  Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union.  However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert.  Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress.  Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies.  They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage.  Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan.  Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: "wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them".&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"&gt;[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A.

Brill Online. Excerpts: "The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in ʿAyyūḳī's Warḳa u Gulshāh.  Niẓāmī states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Niẓāmī added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjnūn and Laylī united in paradise at the end of the romance."&lt;/ref&gt;

He Persianises&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, "Layli and Majnun: Madness and Mystic Longing" Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun. 2003, pp. 76–77, excerpt: Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami's time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami's romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‘Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"/&gt;

====Eskandar Nameh====
*'''Eskandar-nameh''' (Persian: اسکندرنامه) "The Book of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]" (1194) or (1196–1202)

The [[Alexander Romance|Romance of Alexander the Great]]" contains 10,500 distichs.  There are differences of opinion on whether this was Nezami's last epic or the Haft Paykar.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The names of its dedicatees are uncertain but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from [[Qur'an]]ic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;

The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages.   The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslamEskandar"&gt;
Abel, A. (1978), “Eskandar nāma”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. 4:127–129.  Online: Abel, A.; Ed(s). "Iskandar Nama." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill onlien edition). Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian "knight", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Niẓami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.&lt;/ref&gt; knight.

An English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by [[Henry Wilberforce-Clarke]] was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D176%26work%3D002 |title=Persian Literature in Translation The Packard Humanities Institute: Eskandar-Nama (The Book of Alexander) |publisher=Persian.packhum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haft Paykar====
{{main|The Seven Beauties (poem)}}
*'''Haft Paykar''' (Persian: هفت پیکر) "[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|The Seven Beauties]]" (1197) (also called Bahram-Nama)
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a "Haft Paikar" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Paikar]] of Nizami. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
A pre-Islamic story of Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of [[Bahram Gur|Bahram V]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king, who is born to [[Yazdegerd I|Yazdegerd]] after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to [[Ahura Mazda]] for a child.  The Haft Paykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler [[Bahram Gur]].&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  His adventurous life had already been treated by [[Ferdowsi]] in the [[Shahnama]], to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar |title=HAFT PEYKAR – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of [[Bahram Gur]] and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq.  Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to Nom'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Paykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt; for the pleasure of God.  Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears.  As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (''gūr'') he instead finds his tomb (''gūr'').&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;

Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: "the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time . . . one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature".&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The Haft Paykar is considered the poet's masterpiece.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  Overall, in this masterpiece, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;

The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;The Haft paikar [Engl.], Wilson, Charles Edward, London: Probsthain. 1924. (Probsthain's Oriental series.). {{ISBN|0-85382-017-1}} (see [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0853820171 Amazon])&lt;/ref&gt;  A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Professor Julia Scott Meysami.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

The evil-natured man keeps faith with none; the erring nature does not fail to err.
The scorpion since it is by nature bad—to let it live's a fault, to kill it, good.
Seek knowledge, for through knowledge you effect that doors to you be opened and not closed.
He who shames not at learning can draw forth pearls from the water, rubies from the rock.

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:Nizami Gəncəvinin məqbərəsi.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Mausoleum]] in [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

===Persian culture===
The influence of Neẓāmi's work on the subsequent development of Persian&lt;ref name="Parraello"&gt;Domenico Parrello, "ḴAMSA OF NEẒĀMI" in Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;
literature has been enormous and the Khamsa became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures).&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;  The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages.

In Persian miniature, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works.&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Nezami is admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader''.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;  Nezami composed his verses in [[Persian language|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Russian philologist Ivan Mikhailovich Steblin-Kamensky, Professor and the Dean of the Oriental Department of Saint Petersburg University comments("Oriental Department is ready to cooperate with the West", Saint Petersburg University newspaper,  № 24—25 (3648—49), 1 November 2003").  http://www.spbumag.nw.ru/2003/24/1.shtml – Accessed February 2008.

(in Russian)  excerpt: "Главным, революционным для отечественной науки результатом этой кампании стало отнесение Низами к поэтам азербайджанским, а его творчества к достижениям азербайджанской литературы, в то время как в мировом востоковедении (а ранее и в советском) доминировал взгляд на него как представителя литературы персидской. Точки зрения, что Низами персидский поэт, и сегодня придерживаются ученые многих стран, в первую очередь — Ирана.".  "...while in the realm of the world Oriental Studies (and prior to this in the Soviet as well), the viewpoint of him as a representative of Persian literature.  The viewpoint that Nezami is a Persian poet is even today held by the scholars of many countries, specially of Iran."&lt;/ref&gt; consider Nezami as a significant [[Persian people|Persian]] poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lalita Sinha (Universiti Sains Malaysia, Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature and Comparative Religion). Garden of Love. World Wisdom, Inc, 2008. {{ISBN|1-933316-63-2}}. page: 24. "Hailed by scholars of Persian literature as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature (Levy 1969, XI), Nizami is also referred...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the Five Treasures of Nezami as their model may be mentioned [[Amir Khusro]], Jalal Farahani, [[Khwaju Kermani]], Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman [[Jami]], Hatefi Jami, [[Vahshi Bafqi]], Maktabi Shirazi, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], [[Abdul-Qader Bedil|Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi]], [[Fuzûlî]], Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-ye-jamali |title=ḴAMSA-ye JAMĀLI – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahmad Khani]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Not only poets, but historians such as Rawandi were also influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poem in rendering history.  Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.

According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: ''Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones.  The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions'' of Layli and Majnun.&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt;

According to Vahid Dastgerdi, ''If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun''.

[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that:  ''Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge''.

[[Jami]] in his Baharestan mentions that: ''Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description''.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: ''The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses'' and ''To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time''.

[[Amir Khusro]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,&lt;br&gt;
Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.&lt;br&gt;
In it – pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,&lt;br&gt;
Yet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting."

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
''A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love.  Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.''

With regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential.  Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

Nezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]".  Recorded with [[Derek and the Dominos]], "Layla" was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.  The album was highly influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love.  The fifth song of ''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'', "I Am Yours", was in fact a Nezami composition, set to music by Clapton.

In 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized in the [[University of Cambridge]].  The book containing the proceedings of this conference was published under the title: "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim " in 2011 by Leiden Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Johan Christoph |last1=Burgel |first2=Christine |last2=van Ruyuymbeke |title=Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim |publisher= Amsterdam University Press |year=2011 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z5YccgAACAAJ }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">'''Performance Writing''' was pioneered at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in [[Devon|Devon, UK]] as a radical new approach to writing. It is a multi-modal approach which explores through artistic practice how [[writing]] interacts with other art forms and practices — [[visual art]], [[sound art]], [[video art|time-based media]], [[installation art|installation]], [[electronic literature]], [[Artist's book|bookworks]], and [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Writing/446221925633?v=info&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Performance Writing was inaugurated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] undergraduate course at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1994. The course was written, and the field developed, by a number of self-described Performance Writers and academics including John Hall, Ric Allsopp, [[Caroline Bergvall]], Aaron Williamson, Brigid Mc Leer, Alaric Sumner, [[Redell Olsen]], [[cris cheek]], Peter Jager, Barbara Bridger, Melanie Thompson, Jerome Fletcher, and many others, and enriched by an program of visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen"&gt;John Hall, ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing: a Lecture'', Plymouth, UK: Plymouth College of Art Press, 2007. (A more extensive list of performance writers is given on p.35.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the merger of DCA and [[University College Falmouth]] ( now [[Falmouth University]] in 2010, the undergraduate Performance Writing course was relocated to a new performance centre at Tremough Campus (now [[Penryn Campus]]) near [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. The course ceased taking applications for new students from 2010 onwards pending a reconfiguration of its Performance Writing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013037/http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment has not resumed.

The [[Falmouth University]] post-graduate [[Master of Arts]] course in Performance Writing led by Associate Professor of Performance Writing Jerome Fletcher ran for two years at the [[Arnolfini]] in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/201/courses-7/postgraduate-courses-43/performance-writing-ma-1688.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment to the MA Performance Writing was ceased in 2012. Performance Writing continues at the postgraduate and research level at [[Falmouth University]].

The democratic, inclusive, and above all extensible nature of Performance Writing methodology has led to its adoption and adaptation by both independent and academic researchers, practitioners, pedagogs, and institutions in places as far flung as Oakland, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacket2.org/commentary/what-performance-writing|title= What is performance writing? |publisher=Jacket2|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Banff Centre]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca//programs/program.aspx?id=1393|title=In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge|publisher=The Banff Centre|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Performance Writing methodologies and sensibilities have spread – primarily through graduates of the program at Dartington – into a rich diversity of artistic forms and institutional formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luckysoap.com/lapsuslinguae/2013/07/writing-on-writing-on-performance-writing/|title=Writing on Writing on Performance Writing |publisher=J. R. Carpenter|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of definition==
As an emerging field, its definition and limits are the subject of ongoing debate. John Hall's lecture ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing'', explores [[definition]] as a process, using playful and precise language to establish the complexity of reflexive descriptions: a performance of writing about writing as such.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen" /&gt;

At the symposium launching the field, Performance Writing was described by Caroline Bergvall as exploring "relationships between textual and text-based work when developed in conjunction with other media and discourses.", and opening "the investigation of formal and ideological strategies which writers and artists develop textually in response or in reaction to their own time and their own fields"&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote"&gt;Caroline Bergvall, [http://www.carolinebergvall.com/content/text/BERGVALL-KEYNOTE.pdf Keynote Paper for Performance Writing Symposium], Dartington, U.K. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also understood it as "not primarily [a] unified academic discipline [or] one delineated, hybridic artform", but rather as an "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into."&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote" /&gt;

==Events==
Performance Writing events so far include two symposia; one at Dartington College of Arts in 1996 and a second at the Theatre School in Utrecht in 1999.

In May 2010 Bristol's [[Arnolfini]], in collaboration with University College Falmouth, held ''PW10'': a weekend of Performance Writing themed talks, readings, and artistic works exploring [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to language and [[textuality]]. It was timed to coincide with the exhibition ''Say: "Parsley"'' by Performance Writing co-founder [[Caroline Bergvall]] and Ciaran Maher. It included works by [[Allen Fisher]], [[Drew Milne]], [[David Prior (artist)]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[J.R. Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 Arnolfini Programme 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302211816/http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 PW12 was held at [[Arnolfini]].

'''Planographic printing''' means printing from a flat surface, as opposed to a raised surface (as with [[relief print]]ing) or incised surface (as with [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing).  [[Lithograph]]y and [[offset printing|offset lithography]] are planographic processes that rely on the property that water will not mix with oil. The image is created by applying a [[:wiktionary:tusche|tusche]] (greasy substance) to a  plate or stone. (The term lithography comes from ''litho'', for ''stone'', and -''graph'' to draw.) Certain parts of the semi-absorbent surface being printed on can be made receptive to ink while others (the blank parts) reject it.

'''Robert Ronald McIan''' (1803 – 13 December 1856), also '''Robert Ranald McIan''', was a Scottish actor and painter. He is best known for [[romanticism|romanticised]] depictions of [[Scottish clan]]smen, their battles and domestic life.

His wife, [[Fanny McIan]], was a painter and early teacher of art to women.

==Acting==
McIan was born in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=A biographical history of the fine arts | last= Spooner | first= S. | publisher = J. W. Routon |location =New York |year=1865 |volume= 2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSUoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 1143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1803.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=M'Ian, Robert Ronald|first=John Miller |last=Gray|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an actor with the joint company of the Theatre Royals in [[Bristol Old Vic|Bristol]] and [[Theatre Royal, Bath|Bath]]&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; before making his way to London. In 1838 he played at the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] and at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] in the following year.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; He gained a reputation for playing Highlanders on the stage,&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; at a time when the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] had revived interest in Highland culture.

It's not clear when he gave up the stage to devote himself to painting. He played the jester in the [[Eglinton Tournament of 1839]]&lt;ref name="Dickens" /&gt; and the 1885 [[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]] says he retired in that year.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; A [[Letters of Charles Dickens|letter from Charles Dickens]] mentions seeing McIan perform on 23 June 1841,&lt;ref name="Dickens" /&gt; not long before McIan's wife started a steady job as a teacher.

==Personal life==

[[WP Frith]] described McIan as "a Highlander and fierce [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]",&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{citation | title=1840–1841 Volume 2 of The letters of Charles Dickens | last=Dickens | first=Charles | author-link=Charles Dickens |editor-last = House | editor-first = Madeline | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1988 | isbn=978-0-19-811478-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69G9DUjLqgIC&amp;pg=PA309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Vizetelly]] wrote that he "was generally voted an intolerable bore".&lt;ref name="Dickens" /&gt;

McIan eloped with and married&lt;ref name="Trans-Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.transatlanticpub.com/cat/biograph/woma5834.htm | title=Woman of Design, A Man of Passion: The Pioneering McIans | publisher=Trans-Atlantic Publications |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frances (Fanny) Whitaker&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; (c.1814–1897),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Belinda | last=Morse | contribution=McIan , Frances Matilda (c.1814–1897) | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101067976 | date=September 2004 | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/67976 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of a Bath cabinet maker.&lt;ref name="Trans-Atlantic" /&gt; A friend described them as "The painter and his painter-wife – two who went hand in hand, and heart with heart, together through the world".&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{Citation | first=F. Graeme | last=Chalmers | title=Fanny McIan and London's Female School of Design, 1842–57 | journal= Woman's Art Journal | volume =16 | date=Autumn 1995 – Winter 1996 | pages=3–9 | publisher=Woman's Art Inc | jstor=1358568 | issue=2 | doi=10.2307/1358568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs McIan was a noted painter in her own right, who exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and other leading galleries. She too favoured historical subjects from the Highlands, such as ''Highlander defending his Family at the [[Massacre of Glencoe]]''.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; The Highlander in question would have been a [[MacDonald of Glencoe]], also known as Clan McIan.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; From 1842 until Robert's death she was the first Superindent of the Female School of Design, which became the Royal Female School of Art and ultimately part of the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;

They moved to 9 Great Coram Street in 1843 and 36 [[Charlotte Street]] in 1849.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{citation | title=The Royal Scottish Academy, 1826–1916 | last=Royal Scottish Academy | author-link=Royal Scottish Academy | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cem_xraRhSYC&amp;pg=PA240 | pages=240–1 | isbn=978-1-110-74938-6 | date=July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

McIan learnt to paint whilst he was an actor, and submitted his first landscape to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1836.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;!-- needs checking, the DNB scan is unclear and it could be 1830 or 1839, I've also seen 1835 mentioned --&gt; He exhibited in the [[Suffolk Street Gallery]] in 1835 and 1837 whilst acting at the newly rebuilt [[Lyceum Theatre, London|English Opera House]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; His 1838 portrait of novelist [[Anna Maria Hall]] (Mrs [[Samuel Carter Hall|S.C. Hall]]) was praised by [[Camilla Toulmin (writer)|Camilla Toulmin]].&lt;ref name="Dickens" /&gt;

He is perhaps best known for his illustrations in ''The Clans of The Scottish Highlands'', published in 1845 on the centenary of the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]] with text by [[James Logan (writer)|James Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Clans of the Scottish Highlands. Title Page – Volume I | publisher=The Highland Council | url= http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_page.jsp?item_id=12348 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proved so popular that it was reissued in 1857, after his death.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; His depictions of clansmen fanned the romantic revival of interest in [[Gàidhealtachd|Gaeldom]] that was led by [[Queen Victoria]], to whom the book was dedicated.

McIan's early paintings concentrated on scenes from domestic life in the Highlands, such as illicit [[Scotch whisky|whisky]] stills and women grinding corn. These culminated in the 1848 sequel to the ''Clans'' book, entitled ''Gaelic Gatherings: Or The Highlanders at Home, on the Heath, the River and the Loch''.

In later life his works increasingly took on overtly nationalistic subjects, celebrating the exploits of Highland soldiers against the English and overseas. Paintings of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|79th Cameron Highlanders]] were commissioned by Colonel [[Lauderdale Maule]]&lt;ref name="RSA" /&gt; to celebrate the end of his ten-year colonelcy of the regiment in December 1852. ''An Incident in the Revolutionary War of America'' showed the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders#Briar Creek and Charleston|71st Fraser Highlanders']] heroic defence at the [[Battle of Stono Ferry]]&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; and was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1854.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

McIan was elected an associate of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] in 1852&lt;ref name="RSA" /&gt; and died at [[Hampstead]], north London, on 13 December 1856.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

'''''Revenge of the Nerds''''' is a 1984 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Jeff Kanew]], and starring [[Robert Carradine]] and [[Anthony Edwards]], with [[Curtis Armstrong]], [[Ted McGinley]], [[Julia Montgomery]], [[Brian Tochi]], [[Larry B. Scott]], [[Michelle Meyrink]], [[John Goodman]], and [[Donald Gibb]].&lt;ref name="Revenge 1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/88129/Revenge-of-the-Nerds/full-credits.htmll|title=Revenge of the Nerds|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=United States|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film's plot chronicles a group of [[nerd]]s at the fictional Adams College trying to stop the ongoing harassment by the [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], the Alpha Betas, in addition to the latter's sister sorority, Pi Delta Pi.

==Plot==
Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe enroll in Adams College to study [[computer science]]. The Alpha Betas, a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] that includes most of the Adams football team, carelessly burn down their house, and urged by Coach Harris, take over the freshman dorms. Dean Ulich designates temporary living space in the gymnasium, and allows the freshmen to rush the fraternities. Lewis, Gilbert, and several other nerds fail to join fraternities, but are able to secure a dilapidated house on campus and repair it as a residence.

The Alpha Betas, led by star quarterback Stan Gable, are irked by the nerds' success, and Stan sets his fellow members to pull pranks against the nerds. The nerds try to get [[campus police]] to help, but the campus cops are constrained by the Greek Council that adjudicates all such pranks, of which Stan is currently president. The nerds decide to seek membership on the Greek Council by joining a national fraternity. The only one that considers them is the [[List of African American Greek and fraternal organizations|black fraternity]] Lambda Lambda Lambda (Tri-Lambs), led by U.N. Jefferson. Jefferson is wary of their application but agrees to a probationary period. The nerds set up a large party with the Omega Mu sorority, similarly made up of nerds, including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy, and invite Jefferson to attend. The party is dull until Booger provides them with high quality [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Suddenly, the Alpha Betas and the Pi Delta Pis, the sorority which Stan's girlfriend Betty Childs belongs to, disrupt the party by bringing and releasing pigs. The nerds get back at both groups by pulling similar pranks. Jefferson is impressed with the nerds' tenacity against the hazing, and grants them full membership.

The nerds go to appeal to the Council, but Gable remains indifferent. The nerds realize the only way to get the Council to help is to put one of their own in as president, which they can do by winning the [[Intramural sports|Greek Games]] during [[Homecoming]]. Working along with the Omega Mus, the Tri-Lambs are able to use their wits to hold close to the Alpha Betas/Pi Delta Pis during the athletic events. At the charity event, the nerds readily outsell the Alpha Betas by offering pies with naked pictures of Betty and other Pi Delta Pis on the bottom. During this, Lewis, who has fallen in love with Betty, steals Stan's costume and &lt;!--Do not change this - we write it as how the scene was taken when the film was released and do not apply revisionism. We do talk about the scene as it is seen now in the Reception section--&gt;tricks Betty into having sex with him. She is surprised when Lewis reveals his identity, but later admits to Stan that she is "in love with a nerd". Finally, the nerds readily win the musical competition with a techno-[[Computer music|computer-driven musical production]], winning the overall games. Lewis immediately nominates Gilbert as the new Council president.

Coach Harris lambastes the Alpha Betas for losing to the nerds, and Stan leads them in destroying the Tri-Lamb house. The nerds become despondent, and Gilbert decides to barge into the middle of the Homecoming Pep Rally to address his complaints. The Alpha Betas try to stop him, but then Jefferson and the other national Tri-Lambs arrive to intimidate the players, giving Gilbert the opportunity to give a rousing speech about being discriminated as nerds and standing up to that. Lewis and the other Tri-Lambs, several alumni, and even Betty join in as they cheer Gilbert on, soundly shaming the Alpha Betas. Dean Ulich instructs Coach Harris that the Tri-Lambs will be living in the Alpha Beta house, while the Alpha Betas will live in the gym until they can repair the Tri-Lamb house.

==Production==
Exterior scenes such as the arrival of the nerds at college and the fraternity houses were filmed at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. The original Nerds residence, from which they were ousted by the Alpha Betas, was actually [[Cochise Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.life.arizona.edu/undergraduate/has/halldescripts/cochise.asp |title=ResLife: Cochise Hall |publisher=Life.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728221826/http://www.life.arizona.edu/undergraduate/has/halldescripts/cochise.asp |archivedate=July 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their subsequent residence was U of A's [[Bear Down]] Gymnasium.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The original Alpha Beta fraternity house that is burned down was filmed at the [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] house and the [[Beta Theta Pi]] house (on University Boulevard).

The consensus is: "Undeniably lowbrow but surprisingly sly, ''Revenge of the Nerds'' has enough big laughs to qualify as a minor classic in the slobs-vs.snobs subgenre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/revenge_of_the_nerds|title=Revenge of the Nerds|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a 41 out of 100 ratio on [[Metacritic]] based on five critics' reviews and signifying "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/revenge-of-the-nerds|title=Revenge of the Nerds|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revenge of the Nerds'' is #91 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/7092?page=2 |title=Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies" on Lists of Bests |publisher=Listsofbests.com |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202111234/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/7092?page=2 |archivedate=February 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About three decades after the film's release, commentators have looked back at the film and considered some of the scenes, particularly when Lewis pretends to be Stan and has a sexual encounter with Betty, to be [[rape by deception]], and a misogynistic remnant of a male-dominated culture of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  =http://www.chicagonow.com/chicagos-real-law-blog/2015/07/abusing-women-was-cool-in-the-80s/ | title = Abusing women was cool in the 80's | first = Michael | last=  Hefland | date = July 1, 2015 | accessdate = November 5, 2015 | work = [[Chicago Now]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bradley of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' stated that after viewing the film again as an adult he "was immediately struck by the way the film plays sexual exploitation and assault for laughs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.themarysue.com/reconsidering-revenge/ | title = Reconsidering Revenge: How Revenge Of The Nerds‘ Misogyny Is Evident In Current Nerd Culture | first = William | last = Bradley | date = April 3, 2015 | accessdate = November 5, 2015 | work = [[The Mary Sue]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Benfor of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' wrote that the ''Revenge of the Nerds'' scene, and a similar scene in [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', were evidence that at the time of these films' productions, "people were stupid about date rape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/2009/08/11/16_candles/ | title = The "Sixteen Candles" date rape scene? | first = Amy | last = Benfor | date = October 9, 2009 | accessdate = November 5, 2015 | work = [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Revenge of the Nerds IV: Nerds in Love]]'' (1994) (TV)

===Planned remake===
A [[remake]] of the original ''Revenge of the Nerds'' was slated for release in 2007, the first project for the newly created [[Fox Atomic]], but was canceled in November 2006 after two weeks of filming.&lt;ref name="VarietyAtomic" /&gt; The cast included [[Adam Brody]], [[Dan Byrd]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Kristin Cavallari]], [[Jenna Dewan]], [[Chris Marquette]], [[Ryan Pinkston]], [[Efren Ramirez]], and [[Nick Zano]]. The film was to be directed by [[Kyle Newman]], executive produced by [[McG]], and written by [[Gabe Sachs]] and [[Jeff Judah]], Adam Jay Epstein and [[Andrew Jacobson]], and [[Adam F. Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegenews.org/x6334.xml|title="Nerds" Get Revenge on Agnes Scott Campus|publisher=Collegenews.org|date=November 3, 2006|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] at [[Agnes Scott College]], the [[Georgia State Capitol]], and [[Inman Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/movies/stories/2006/10/13/1014LVnerds.html|title='Nerds' will hang out in Atlanta|publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|author=Longino, Bob|date=October 14, 2006|accessdate=June 8, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202143831/http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/movies/stories/2006/10/13/1014LVnerds.html|archivedate=February 2, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was originally scheduled to take place at [[Emory University]], but university officials changed their minds after reading the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=f8e2e05e-dec6-47fd-a82c-a23b8dce50f0|title=No Revenge for New Nerds|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Grossberg, Josh|date=November 22, 2006|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=naughty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-11-23/news/0611230299_1_fox-atomic-revenge-campus |title=Naughty `Nerds' remake is shut down - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=November 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shelved after producers found the movie difficult to shoot on the smaller Agnes Scott campus and studio head Peter Rice was disappointed with the [[dailies]].&lt;ref name="VarietyAtomic"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com:80/2006/film/markets-festivals/atomic-blast-to-nerds-1117954365/ |title=Atomic blast to 'Nerds'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |author1=LaPorte, Nicole |author2=Alex Romanelli |date=November 21, 2006 |access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[20th Century Fox]] personnel have stated that it is highly unlikely that a remake will be picked up in the future.&lt;ref name=naughty/&gt;

===Television===
In the mid-2000s, Armstrong and Carradine had devised an idea for a [[reality television]] show based on nerds competiting against each other in challenges, inspired by ''Revenge of the Nerds''. However, the idea was rejected at the time, due to the competing ''[[Beauty and the Geek]]'' show. Six years later, Armstrong and Carradine shopped the idea around and were able to get the show greenlit on [[TBS (U.S. TV network)|TBS]] in 2012. ''[[King of the Nerds]]'' ran for three seasons from 2013 to 2015, with Armstrong and Carradine hosting the program.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/curtis-booger-armstrong-on-his-new-reality-show-king-of-the-nerds-20130214|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2015|last=Greene|first=Andy|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Curtis 'Booger' Armstrong on His New Reality Show, 'King of the Nerds'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rock Profile''''' is a British television comedy show written by and starring [[double act|comedy partnership]] [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], both later widely known for the [[sketch comedy|sketch show]] ''[[Little Britain]]''. ''Rock Profile'' first appeared on the channel [[UK Play]] in 1999, directed by [[Michael Cumming]], before moving to [[BBC Two]] in 2000.

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving [[Jamie Theakston]] questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.

== Broadcast history ==

The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In Christmas 2000, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled ''[[Rock the Blind]]''. The episode followed [[Gary Barlow]] (Lucas) and [[Ronan Keating]] (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. [[Ted Robbins]] appeared as [[Pete Waterman]], and [[Sara Cox]] as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years.

In October 2001, several sketches were comprised for the re-launch of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', entitled ''The All-New Top of the Pops''. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. Fans of the series were happy to see its brief return, however, people who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments. Complaints were also sparked regarding the sketch featuring Lucas as [[Elton John]], who was being interviewed about his appearance on ''TOTP'', in which he performed ''[[The Lion King]]'''s main theme, "[[Circle of Life]]". A member of the audience also verbally harassed Lucas during the sketch, which resulted in the entire feature being cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, meaning only the DVD release is the only existent source to the public to view these.

In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website [[Funny or Die]] for free viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/05/lucas_and_walliams_revive_rock_profiles.html|title=Lucas and Walliams revive Rock Profiles|work=broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host [[Dermot O'Leary]]. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with [[Katie Price|Jordan]] and [[Peter Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|title=Rock Profile:Peter Andre &amp; Jordan Pt.1|work=Funny or Die|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729033635/http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''Rock Profile'' has been well received by critics. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described the show as "truly silly and truly inspired". ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' described it as "excellent comedy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Rock Profile |publisher=BBC DVD |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called it "hilarious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/221770/Rock-Profile-on-DVD.html |title=''Rock Profile'' on DVD |last=Wood |first=Beci |date=July 26, 2005 |website=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD release ==

A DVD release of ''Rock Profile'' appeared in 2005, featuring both series, ''Rock the Blind'', the ''TOTP'' sketches, as well as a never-before seen commercial and sketches composed for ''The Ralf Little Show''.

[[File:Roosterhawaii.jpg|thumb|Wild rooster on the Hawaiian island of Kauai]]
A '''rooster''', also known as a '''cockerel''' or '''cock''', is an adult male [[Galliformes|gallinaceous]] bird, usually an adult male [[chicken]] (''Gallus gallus domesticus'').

Mature male chickens less than one year old are called cockerels. The term "rooster" originates in the United States,&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/why-do-we-say-17 Hugh Rawson] "Why Do We Say...? Rooster", ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is widely used throughout North America, as well as Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The older terms "cock" or "cockerel", the latter denoting a young cock, are used in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poultry.ie/2009/08/03/dorking-the-five-toed-chicken/ poultry.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501180347/http://poultry.ie/2009/08/03/dorking-the-five-toed-chicken/ |date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at day, which is done by both sexes. The rooster is [[polygamy|polygamous]], but cannot guard several nests of eggs at once. He guards the general area where his hens are [[bird nest|nest]]ing, and attacks other roosters that enter his territory. During the daytime, a rooster often sits on a high perch, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1|abbr=in|order=flip}} off the ground, to serve as a lookout for his group (hence the term "rooster"). He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby and will frequently crow to assert his territory.

==Crowing==
[[File:Hanenkraaiwedstrijd.jpg|thumb|A young [[Bergische Kräher|Berg crower]] at a crowing contest]]
[[File:KrährufBergischerKräher.ogg|thumb|The long crowing of a [[Bergische Kräher|Berg crower]]]]
[[File:Rooster crowing small.ogv|thumb|Normal length crowing (with audio)]]
[[File:Cocks Fighting.jpg|thumb|Two cocks fighting]]
[[File:Fighting cock Philippines.jpg|thumb|right|A rooster from the [[Philippines]] crowing. Note the characteristic neck bending that always takes place during crowing.]]
Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Read|first=Gina|title=Sexing Chickens|url=http://successwithpoultry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/sexing-chickens.html|work=Keeping Chickens Newsletter|publisher=keepingchickensnewsletter.com|accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn ("cock-a-doodle-doo"). However, while many roosters crow shortly after waking up, this idea is not exactly true. A rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster's breed and individual personality. A rooster can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory.

Roosters have several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks.

Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blsde_20110627_002 Cock crowing contest recognised as National Heritage in Belgium] Stefaan De Groote, ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 27. June 2011 (in Dutch). Accessed October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the United States, [[Indonesia]] and Japan. The oldest contests are held with [[Long-crowing chicken|longcrowers]]. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.

==Capons==
{{Main|Capon}}
A capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird's [[testis|testes]] are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster's sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development:
*The comb and wattles cease growing after castration, giving a capon's head a dwarfed appearance.
*The hackle, tail and saddle [[feather]]s grow unusually long.

Caponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird's testes eliminates the male sex [[hormone]]s, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight.

This procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken.

==Cockfighting==
{{Main|Cockfight}}
[[File:Cockfighter.jpg|thumb|A fighting cock for sale]]
A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two [[gamecock]]s or cocks, with the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock gamecock - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary] – first use of word – 1646&lt;/ref&gt; after the term "cock of the game" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of [[cockfight]]ing in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially [[bred]] and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called [[Dubbing (poultry)|dubbing]]. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of [[animal cruelty]] by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |title=Should cockfighting be outlawed in Oklahoma? |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=17 August 2009 |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619150618/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner. There are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the [[cockfight]] which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the [[Balinese Hinduism]] spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], where [[ritual]] fights usually take place outside the [[temple]] and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[Indonesia Handbook, 3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, &amp; Jane Bickersteth], (Footprint – Travel Guides) 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the [[Catacombs]] from the earliest period&lt;ref name="Rev. John McClintock page 6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclopaedia of biblical, theological and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 12|author=Rev.

==The cockerel "waltz"==
[[File:Replica Statue of a Cock.JPG|thumb|Statue of a Rooster Cock at a park in South India]]
The cockerel "waltz", when the cockerel struts in a half circle with one wing extended down, is an aggressive approach signifying to females his dominance, and usually, the female will submit by running or moving away from the cockerel in acknowledgement. On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. Note also that the cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.

Some more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard.

==Religion and spiritual belief systems==

===Animism, shamanism and tribal religions===
In [[Southeast Asia]], understandings and interpretations of indigenous beliefs of the veneration of spirits and deities remain strong and for many who are practicing Christians there is still the veneration of the traditional spirits ([[anito]]) as in northern Philippines.

{{main|Samaritans}}
The Samaritans or 'Cutheans' are an ethnic group with a long history, once widely distributed and powerful. From Assyria they extended to India, China, Arabia Petraea and Abyssinia. They were also introduced by the Assyrian Empire into Samaria, in a policy of mass deportations. They had their Samaritan Temple on [[Mount Gerizim]], opposite the Temple in Jerusalem, and they worshipped the Mesopotamian deity [[Nergal]]: his emblem was a ''cock'' (rooster).&lt;ref&gt;([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]], 17:30). "According to the rabbis, his emblem was a cock".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/2_kings/17.htm Clarke's Commentary on the Bible - 2 Kings 17:30]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zohar]] (iii. 22b, 23a, 49b), the book of [[Jewish]] [[mysticism]] and collection of writings on the [[Torah]] written by first century tannaic sage [[Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai]] (Rashbi), tells of a celestial manifestation, which causes the crowing of the roosters; known also in the [[Talmud]], is "blessed be He who has given the cock intelligence", (Ber. 60b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=BARUCH, APOCALYPSE OF (Greek) |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2563-baruch-apocalypse-of-greek|first= |last= |volume= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as well as Job 38:36 in the [[Douay-Rheims]] Bible. Not only "In the rabbinic literature, the cockcrow is used as general marking of time",&lt;ref&gt; The Chronology of the Crucifixion – A Comparison of the Gospel Accounts – Tim Hegg TorahResource – 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but also some of the Sages interpreted the "cockcrow" to mean the voice of the Temple officer who summoned all priests, [[Levites]], and [[Israelites]] to their duties and used as such because the Hebrew gever was used also to mean a "rooster" in addition to the meaning of "man, strong man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chronology of the Crucifixion – A comparison of the Gospel Accounts|author=Tim Hegg|publisher=TorahResource|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] likewise provides the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks"&lt;ref&gt; A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron – 1985&lt;/ref&gt; – (Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b), which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins"([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" within the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31. Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "a cock girded about the loins" within [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18 – Michael V. Fox – Yale University Press 2009 – 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema of purpose and use, within Judeo-Christian traditions. The Hebrew term zarzir, which literally means "girt"; "that which is girt in the loins" (BDB 267 s.v.) is recognized in the Targum as well as the Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, LXX and Vulgate with all referencing the fighting rooster or fighting cock as the religious vessel. The ancient Hebrew versions identified the Hebrew "a girt one of the loins" of Proverbs 30:31 as a rooster, "which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a fighting cock",&lt;ref&gt; Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament HALOT 1:281 s.v. zarzir&lt;/ref&gt; with also the Arabic sarsar or sirsir being an onomatopoeticon or onomatopoeia for rooster (alektor) as the Hebrew zarzir of Proverbs 30:31. "Rooster (Gallus domesticus) bones were identified at Lachish dating to early Iron II",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life in Biblical Israel|author=Douglas A Knight|author2=Philip J.

In excavations at Gibeon, near Jerusalem, dating to the seventh century B.C., potsherds were found incised with cocks and "some of them placed within the six-pointed star of the Magen David".&lt;ref&gt; Early Records of the Domestic Fowl in Ancient Judea by Mikhaetl Taran published in 1975 in IBIS, The International Journal of Avian Science&lt;/ref&gt; The seal of Jaazaniah carries the insignia of a rooster from the ruins of the biblical Judean kingdom at [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]], with the inscription of "belonging to Jaazaniah, servant to the king".,&lt;ref&gt; A history of ancient Israel and Judah by James Maxwell Miller and John Haralson Hayes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, edited by E.

[[Plutarch]] said the inhabitants of [[Caria]] carried the emblem of the rooster on the end of their lances and relates that origin to [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes]], who awarded a Carian who was said to have killed [[Cyrus the Younger]] at the battle of [[Cunaxa]] in 401 B.C "the privilege of carrying ever after a golden cock upon his spear before the first ranks of the army in all expeditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/persanpersia/achaemenidhakhmaneshiyndynasty550-3|title=Hakhamaneshiyan(Achaemenid) Dynasty – Cyrus the great|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Carians]] also wore crested helmets at the time of [[Herodotus]], for which reason "the Persians gave the Carians the name of cocks".&lt;ref name="Gubernatis1872"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angelo De Gubernatis|authorlink=Angelo de Gubernatis |title=Zoological Mythology: Or, The Legends of Animals|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVQZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=Mythology+cock#v=onepage&amp;q=carians&amp;f=false|year=1872|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Carites in [[2 Kings]] 11 who were used by [[Jehoiada]] to protect [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] son of [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]] of the line of [[David]], ancestor to [[Christ]] from [[Athaliah]]. In the Jewish religious practice of [[Kapparos]], a rooster as a religious vessel is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the [[Day of Atonement]]. The meat is the distributed among the poor for their pre-fast meal. The purpose of the ritual is the expiation of sins of the man as the animal symbolically receives all the man's sins, which is based on the reconciliation of Isaiah 1:18. The religious practice is mentioned for the first time by [[Natronai ben Hilai]], Gaon of the Academy of Sura in [[Babylonia]], in 853 C.E., who describes it as a custom of the Babylonian Jews and further explained by Jewish scholars in the ninth century by that since the [[Hebrew]] word geber (Gever)&lt;ref&gt; Complete Jewish Bible by David H. Stern -1998&lt;/ref&gt; means both "man" and "rooster" the rooster may act or serve as a palpable substitute as a religious vessel in place of the man with the practice also having been as a custom of the Persian Jews.

===Islam===
The understanding of the divine spiritual endowment of the rooster within [[Islam]], may be evidenced in the words of [[Muhammad]] of that [[Abrahamic religion]] in one of the six canonical hadith collections of [[Sunni Islam]], stating that of "when you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah's Blessings for they have seen an angel".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 54, Number 522&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Tao religious aspect, to have a rooster fight another rooster, was the same in substance as a fire-renewal custom, where the rooster and the cockfight then takes its place as an indispensable spring ritual, and "Taoism, which assessed it positively in this form, can be thought to have guaranteed its continued existence".&lt;ref&gt; A Brush with the Spur: Robert Joe Cutter on the Chinese Cockfight, (review-article of The Brush and the Spur: Chinese Culture and the Cockfight), in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 113.3 (1993), pp. 444-49"[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/afs/pdf/a872.pdf]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanshi festival was eventually moved to coincide with the [[Qingming Festival]] or the [[Pure Brightness Festival]] which still includes the rooster and cockfight.&lt;ref&gt; Qingming Riverside Landscape Garden – Cultural-China.com, Shanghai, People's Republic of China "{{cite web |url=http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812045704/http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df=dmy-all}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Huguet-estructuraStAgusti.png|thumb|Possible original layout of the altarpiece, following F. Ruiz i Quesada]]
The  '''''Saint Augustine Altarpiece''''' is a [[Catalan Gothic]] painting in [[egg tempera]] by [[Jaume Huguet]] and [[Pau Vergós]] made between 1462 and 1475. The long duration of the work was caused by financial reasons, and it is assumed that work was begun by Huguet and finished by other members of his workshop, in particular [[Pau Vergós]]. The [[altarpiece]] was commissioned by the guild of [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s to be placed on the altar of the [[Augustinian]] [[friary]] of [[Sant Agustí Vell]] ("Old St Augustine") in [[Barcelona]], Spain. The panel measures 250 x 193 x 9.5 cm and has been in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]] since 1927. &lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=b0bc6ed7bfb56723bcb9d02396e67d3c071f237560d018de09a6b46dda289842?inventoryNumber=024140-000&amp;lang=en Artwork at MNAC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comparisons with similar works that survive complete suggest that there were originally several more panels than the eight that now survive, seven in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]] and one in the [[Museu Marès]], also in Barcelona. They would have been framed in an elaborate [[gilding|gilt]] wooden setting as a [[retable]] behind the main altar.  The grandeur of the work makes it the most important painting of the fifteenth century in [[Catalonia]].

== Description ==
In 1463 the Guild of Tanners commissioned an altarpiece from Jaume Huguet for the high altar in the church of Sant Agustí Vell in Barcelona. The unusual size of the piece, one of the largest in Catalan Gothic painting, and the crisis the country was going through at the time, delayed completion of the altarpiece until 1486 and  involved several members of the Huguet workshop, and in particular a member of the Vergós family. Eight panels from this altarpiece are preserved, seven at the MNAC and another at the Museu Marès. The quality of the composition and the pictorial technique of the 'Consecration of Saint Augustine' suggest it can be considered the personal work of the great master.

Typically for Catalan painting at this date, which was conservative by Italian standards, the panel still has a "gold ground" background, decorated in textile-like patterns of ''[[pastiglia]]'' [[stucco]] relief, which is also used for the [[crozier]]s and jewels on the [[mitre]]s and [[vestment]]s of the figures.  Saint [[Augustine]], the dedicatee of the church, is shown being consecrated by several other bishops as [[Bishop of Hippo]] in Roman North Africa, which happened in 395, although the painting shows entirely contemporary styles of dress.  The unvested figure reading a book in a ''chemise'' covering on the left is a [[donor portrait]] of one of the friars, probably the head of the community.  Another friar's head, looking like a portrait, peeps out at the rear right.

== History ==
The work on the altarpiece began on July 20, 1452 when the carpenter Macia Bonafé was given the contract to construct the retable.  It was stipulated that the altarpiece was to rest on a stone base with doors on either side leading to the sacristy.  Bonafé was also to create a figure of the Madonna, which was to rest in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]], as well as the heraldic lions of the guild.  On the same day Bonafé received his contract, the guildsmen engaged [[Luis Dalmau]] to begin working on painting as soon as the construction of the retable was finished.  Dalmau ended up doing no actual work on the piece, for reasons unknown, and on December 4, 1463, the contract was given to Jaume Huguet.  For payment, Huguet received one hundred and ten lliures on February 1 and July 1 of 1464, and was thereafter to draw fifty six lliures every Christmas until the full amount had been paid.&lt;ref name=Rowland&gt;Rowland (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole arrangement was very businesslike with very clear instructions on how Huguet was to proceed.  He was first to paint the four panels of the [[predella]] with scenes from the Passion as conceived in a sketch that he had presented to the guild, and this portion was to be completed by Christmas, 1466.  Huguet was also tasked with painting the figures of saints on the [[sacristy]] doors, coloring the statues, and painting the heraldic lions.  Before he was allowed to begin any painting, he had to present drawings for the approval of the guild and two painters, one chosen by the guild and the other chosen by Huguet.  With the expectation that much of the work would be done by assistants, as it was a very large undertaking, it was specified that Huguet himself would be responsible for painting the heads and hands.&lt;ref name=Rowland/&gt;

It is not until November 29, 1486 that the altarpiece is spoken of as being completed, twenty three years after Huguet was originally commissioned.  The documents also show that Huguet was not paid as originally promised and did not receive his full sum until 1488, when he was still owed 200 lliures.  The reasons for the delay are unknown, but there a couple conjectures as to what happened.  One is that the Constable Dom Pedro arrived six weeks after the contract was drawn up and engaged Huguet to paint him a retable, which would have taken precedence over that of the guild.  It could also be that the guild lost interest or had a lack of finances that temporarily halted the project.&lt;ref name=Rowland/&gt;

The '''Summer Reading Challenge''' is the UK's biggest [[Reading (process)|reading]] challenge for children aged four to eleven. It was started in 1999 and is run annually by [http://www.readingagency.org.uk The Reading Agency] with the public library network (98% of UK libraries take part), featuring different themes per year. The aim is to get children to read six or more books from the library during the summer holidays. Everyone who signs up can keep track of the books they read and receive encouragement to keep reading throughout the holidays. It's free to join and every child who completes the Challenge receives a certificate. Many libraries offer other rewards such as medals and stickers. Materials are available in large print with supplementary information in Braille.

In an Impact Research study for the Summer Reading Challenge, the [http://www.ukla.org/ United Kingdom Literacy Association] (UKLA) found that the Challenge contributed to stemming the 'summer holiday dip' in children's reading achievement.

== How it works ==
The child first asks for registration at the library desk with their library card in their hand. They then receive the Summer Reading Challenge Sheet where they track their progress and add stickers to complete the challenge. They read 2 books at a time '''FROM THE LIBRARY''', record them on their sheet then show the sheet to the librarian where they get 3 stickers to put on their sheet (one often being a [[Scratch and sniff|scratch-n'-sniff]]). After they have collected all the stickers and read their 6 books, they receive a medal and a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/|title=Summer Reading Challenge|website=summerreadingchallenge.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
In Wales, most items are available in bilingual Welsh-English versions.

In Scotland, the Summer Reading Challenge is sponsored by Tesco Bank.
 
The Summer Reading Challenge is also run beyond UK, in Eire and  through the British Council’s teaching and learning services .

An [http://www.summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/ interactive website] for children is available year-round. Here they can create a profile, chat about books, and get help on what to read next  via the digital Book Sorter . This Book Sorter functionality already offers over 300,000 peer to peer children’s book recommendations in child-friendly categories, added by children themselves, who have read these titles in a Summer Reading Challenge or other activity.

== Opportunities ==
[[File:Summer Reading Challenge display (35146599223).jpg|alt=display|left|thumb|2017's Summer Reading Challenge is promoted in a local library, with 'recommended books'.]]
Libraries work closely with schools, and each year library staff promote the Challenge to schools in the summer term. Invitations are provided for children to take home to encourage families to take part.

For young people (aged 13 to 24) there is the opportunity to volunteer in libraries during the Summer Reading Challenge each year to support younger children taking part. 

This volunteering provides a quality workplace experience for young people in libraries, inspires them to think about future careers and increases their employability as they gain useful life skills and confidence. 8,000 young people are expected to volunteer in the 2015 Summer Reading Challenge. Many go on to volunteer to support other library initiatives throughout the year.

[[File:Edward Elgar 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Elgar]]
[[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]]'s '''Symphony No. 1 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op.&amp;nbsp;55''' is one of his two completed symphonies. The first performance was given by the [[The Hallé|Hallé Orchestra]] conducted by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] in Manchester, England, on 3 December 1908. It was widely known that Elgar had been planning a symphony for more than ten years, and the announcement that he had finally completed it aroused enormous interest. The critical reception was enthusiastic, and the public response unprecedented. The symphony achieved what ''[[The Musical Times]]'' described as "immediate and phenomenal success", with a hundred performances in Britain, continental Europe and America within just over a year of its première.

The symphony is regularly programmed by British orchestras, and features occasionally in concert programmes in North America and Europe. It is well represented on record, with recordings ranging from the composer's 1931 version with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] to modern digital recordings, of which more than 20 have been issued since the mid-1980s.

==Composition and première==
Nearly ten years before composing his first symphony, Elgar had been intrigued by the idea of writing a symphony to commemorate General [[Charles George Gordon]] rather as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]] was originally intended to celebrate [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=reed96&gt;Reed p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he wrote to his friend [[August Jaeger]] (the "Nimrod" of the [[Enigma Variations]]), "Now as to Gordon: the thing possesses me, but I can't write it down yet."&lt;ref name=reed96/&gt; After he completed his oratorio ''[[The Kingdom (Elgar)|The Kingdom]]'' in 1906 Elgar had a brief fallow period. As he passed his 50th birthday he turned to his boyhood compositions which he reshaped into ''[[The Wand of Youth]]'' suites during the summer of 1907.&lt;ref name=k53/&gt; He began work on a symphony and when he went to Rome for the winter&lt;ref&gt;"Court Circular", ''The Times'', 6 November 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; he continued work on it, finishing the first movement. After his return to England he worked on the rest of the symphony during the summer of 1908.&lt;ref name=k53&gt;Kennedy, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgar had abandoned the idea of a "Gordon" symphony, in favour of a wholly non-programmatic work. He had come to consider [[abstract music]] as the pinnacle of orchestral composition. In 1905 he gave a lecture on [[Johannes Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 3]], in which he said that when music was simply a description of something else it was carrying a large art somewhat further than he cared for. He thought music, as a simple art, was at its best when it was simple, without description, as in the case of the Brahms symphony.&lt;ref&gt;"Brahms's Third Symphony – Sir E. Elgar's Analysis, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 9 November 1905, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The first page of the manuscript carries the title, "Symphony for Full Orchestra, Op. 55."&lt;ref name=reed97&gt;Reed, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; To the music critic [[Ernest Newman]] he wrote that the new symphony was nothing to do with Gordon, and to the composer [[Walford Davies]] he wrote, "There is no programme beyond a wide experience of human life with a great charity (love) and a massive hope in the future."&lt;ref name=k53/&gt;

[[File:HansRichter1876.png|thumb|left|175px|alt=black and white Victorian photograph of the head and shoulders of a bespectacled man with a large dark beard|[[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], the dedicatee, conducted the première of the symphony]]
The symphony was dedicated "To Hans Richter, Mus. Doc. True Artist and true Friend."&lt;ref name=reed97/&gt; It was premiered on 3 December 1908 in the [[Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester, with Richter conducting the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. The London première followed four days later, at the [[Queen's Hall]], with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Richter.&lt;ref name=k53/&gt; At the first rehearsal for the London concert, Richter addressed the orchestra, "Gentlemen, let us now rehearse the greatest symphony of modern times, written by the greatest modern composer – ''and not only in this country''."  [[William Henry Reed]], who played in the LSO at that concert, recalled, "Arriving at the ''Adagio'', [Richter] spoke almost with the sound of tears in his voice and said: 'Ah! this is a real Adagio – such an Adagio as Beethove' would 'ave writ'."&lt;ref name=reed97/&gt;

''[[The Musical Times]]'' wrote in 1909, "To state that Elgar's Symphony has achieved immediate and phenomenal success is the bare truth." Within weeks of the première the symphony was performed in New York under [[Walter Damrosch]], Vienna under [[Ferdinand Löwe]], St. Petersburg under [[Alexander Siloti]], and Leipzig under [[Artur Nikisch]]. There were performances in Chicago, [[Boston]], Toronto and 15 British towns and cities.&lt;ref name=mt1209&gt;The Musical Times, 1 February 1909, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1909 the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] had given two more performances at [[Carnegie Hall]] and had taken the work to "some of the largest inland cities&amp;nbsp;... It is doubtful whether any symphonic work has aroused so great an interest since [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikowsky]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Pathétique]]''."&lt;ref&gt;"Opera in New York – Our Own Correspondent", ''The Observer'', 14 February 1909, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period the work was played six times in London, under the baton of Richter, the composer, and [[Henry Joseph Wood|Henry Wood]].&lt;ref name=mt1209/&gt; Within just over a year there were a hundred performances worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Adrian. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/elgar/notes/note_symph1.shtml "Edward Elgar, Symphony No 1".] BBC Radio 3. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Musical Times'' printed a digest of press comments on the symphony. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was quoted as saying, "[T]hematic beauty is abundant. It is exquisite in the adagio, and in the first and second allegros, the latter a kind of scherzo; when the rhythmic impulse, the power and the passion are at their extreme height, when the music becomes almost frenzied in its superb energy, the sense of sheer beauty is still strong." ''[[The Morning Post]]'', wrote, "This is a work for the future, and will stand as a legacy for coming generations; in it are the loftiness and nobility that indicate a masterpiece, though its full appreciation will only be from the most serious-minded; to-day we recognise it as a possession of which to be proud." ''[[The Evening Standard]] said, ''Here we have the true Elgar – strong, tender, simple, with a simplicity bred of inevitable expression.&amp;nbsp;... The composer has written a work of rare beauty, sensibility, and humanity, a work understandable of all."&lt;ref&gt;All extracts in this paragraph are from the digest in ''The Musical Times'', 1 January 1909, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Musical Times'' refrained from quoting ''[[The Observer]]'', which was the only dissenting voice among the main newspapers. It complained that the work was derivative of [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Richard Wagner]], and thought the theme of the slow movement "cheap ready-made material". It allowed, however, that "Elgar's orchestration is so magnificently modern that the dress disguises the skeleton."&lt;ref&gt;"Music: The Elgar Symphony", ''The Observer'', 13 December 1908, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This adverse view was in contrast with the praise in ''[[The Times]]'': "[A] great work of art, which is lofty in conception and sincere in expression, and which must stand as a landmark in the development of the younger school of English music." In ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', [[Samuel Langford]] described the work as  "sublime&amp;nbsp;... the work is the noblest ever penned for instruments by an English composer."&lt;ref&gt;Langford, Samuel, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 3 December 1908, p. 5; and 4 December 1908, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'' noted the influence of Wagner and Brahms: "There are characteristic reminiscences of ''[[Parsifal (opera)|Parsifal]]''...&amp;nbsp;and rhythmically the chief theme looks like an offspring of Brahms" but concluded "it is not only an original work, but one of the most original and most important that has been added to the stock of recent music."&lt;ref&gt;"The Queen's-Hall Orchestra", ''The Times'', 2 January 1909, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', which also detected the influence of ''Parsifal'', and, in the finale, of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'', called the symphony "a work of such importance that conductors will not lightly let it drop."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/04/101860511.pdf "Elgar's Symphony – First Time Here".] ''The New York Times'', 4 January 1909, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical analysis==
The work is the only frequently-performed symphony whose main key is [[A-flat major]].
It is scored for three [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (one doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s and [[English horn|cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s and [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (including [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbal]]s), two [[pedal harp|harp]]s, and [[string instrument|string]]s. It is in four movements:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman
|''Andante. Nobilmente e semplice — Allegro''
|''Allegro molto''
|''Adagio''
|''Lento — Allegro''
}}
[[File:Elgar1opening.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The opening and recurring theme]]The symphony is in a [[cyclic form]]:  the incomplete "nobilmente" theme from the first movement returns in the finale for a complete ''grandioso'' statement after various transformations throughout the work. Elgar wrote, "the opening theme is intended to be simple &amp;, in intention, noble &amp; elevating&amp;nbsp;... the sort of ideal call – in the sense of persuasion, not coercion or command – &amp; something above every day &amp; sordid things."&lt;ref&gt;Elgar, Edward. Letter to Ernest Newman, 4 November 1908, reproduced in ''Edward Elgar: Letters of a Lifetime'', ed. Jerrold Northrop Moore (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The musicologist [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] writes "One cannot call it a motto-theme, but it is an [[Idée fixe (psychology)|''idée fixe'']], and after its first quiet statement, the full orchestra repeat it ''fortissimo''. It gently subsides back to woodwind and violas and abruptly switches to D minor, an extraordinary choice of key for the first ''allegro'' of a Symphony in A flat."&lt;ref name=k54&gt;Kennedy, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Reed speculates that Elgar's choice of D minor was a gesture against academic rules.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to the conductor [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]], the clashing keys arose because someone made a bet with Elgar that he could not compose a symphony in two keys at once.&lt;ref name=k54/&gt; It has also been speculated that the contrast was intended to represent two sides of Elgar's own personality - the successful and popular 'Bard of Empire' is heard in the noble A flat motif, set against the inner worries that continually troubled him.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Johnson, notes to LSO Live recording LSO0017 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is in traditional [[sonata form]] with two main themes, a development and a recapitulation. It ends quietly, "an effect of magical stillness".&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kennedy, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elgar1scherzo-and-adagio.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The theme of the second movement (top) transformed in the third movement (bottom)]]
The second movement is a brisk allegro. Elgar did not call it a [[scherzo]], and though Reed calls it "vivacious",&lt;ref name=reed160&gt;Reed, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; others, including Kennedy, have found it restless and even sinister in parts.&lt;ref name=k55/&gt; A middle section, in B{{music|flat}}, is in Elgar's ''Wand of Youth'' vein. He asked orchestras to play it "like something you hear down by the river."&lt;ref name=k55/&gt; As the movement draws to a close it slows down, and its first theme is transformed into the main theme of the slow movement,&lt;ref&gt;Excepting bar 7 of the slow movement where the top A is omitted and the shape is very slightly modified&lt;/ref&gt; despite their contrasting tempi and different keys. According to Reed, "Someone once had the temerity to ask Elgar which version, the ''allegro'' or the ''adagio'', was written first; but the question was not very well received and the subject was not pursued."&lt;ref name=reed162&gt;Reed, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy says of the ''adagio'' that it is "unique among Elgar slow movements in the absence of that anguished yearning usually to be found in his quieter passages. There is no ''Angst'' here, instead a benedictory tranquillity&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=k56&gt;Kennedy, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The second subject of the movement remains in the tranquil vein, and the movement ends in what Reed calls "the astounding effect of the muted trombones in the last five bars&amp;nbsp;... like a voice from another world."&lt;ref name=reed162/&gt;

The finale begins in D minor with a slow repeat of one of the subsidiary themes of the first movement, showing Elgar in "one of his most dreamy and mysterious moods."&lt;ref name=reed162/&gt; After the introduction there is a restless allegro, with a succession of themes including an "impulsive march-rhythm".&lt;ref name=k56/&gt; In a manner recalling the motivic transformation between the second and third movement, this material is later heard at half speed accompanied by harp arpeggios and with a lyrical string melody. The movement builds to a climax and ends with the ''nobilmente'' opening theme of the symphony returning "orchestrated with glittering splendour" to bring the work to a "triumphant and confident" conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 57 and Reed p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[Woodwind]]s: 3 [[Flute]]s, (Fl. III doubles [[Piccolo]]), 2 [[Oboe]]s, [[English Horn]], 2 [[Clarinet]]s in A and B flat, [[Bass Clarinet]] in A and B flat, 2 [[Bassons]] and [[Contrabasson]]

[[Brass]]: 4 [[Horn (instrument)|Horn]]s in F, 3 [[Trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[Trombone]]s (The 3rd trombone could be a [[bass trombone]]) and [[Tuba]]

[[Percussion]]: [[Timpani]], Small [[Snare Drum]], [[Bass Drum]] and [[Cymbals]]

[[String instrument|String]]s: 2 [[Harp]]s, [[Violin]]s I and II; [[Viola]]s, [[Violoncello]]s and [[ContraBass]]es

==Duration==
The composer's 1931 EMI recording of the First Symphony plays for 46 minutes and 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;EMI CD CDM 5-672-6-2: timings of the movements: I = 17:22, II = 7:37, III = 10:18, and IV = 11:13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]]'s archives show that in a 1930 broadcast performance Elgar took 46 minutes.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;Cox, David, "Edward Elgar" in ''The Symphony 2: Elgar to the Present Day'', ed. Robert Simpson (1967), Penguin Books, Harmondsworth. OCLC 500339917.&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was noted for his brisk tempi in his own music, and later performances have been slower. Elgar's contemporaries, [[Henry Joseph Wood|Sir Henry Wood]] and [[Hamilton Harty|Sir Hamilton Harty]] took respectively 50:15 (1930) and 59:45 in 1940.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt; In 1972, while preparing a new recording, [[Georg Solti]] studied Elgar's 1931 performance. Solti's fast tempi, based on the composer's own, came as a shock to Elgarians accustomed to the broader tempi taken by Harty, [[John Barbirolli|Sir John Barbirolli]] and others in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;March, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbirolli's 1963 recording takes 53:53; Solti takes 48:48. Later examples of slower tempi include a 1992 recording conducted by [[Giuseppe Sinopoli]] (55:18), and a 2001 live recording conducted by [[Colin Davis|Sir Colin Davis]] (54:47).&lt;ref&gt;Notes to EMI CD 9689242; Decca CD 475-8226; DG CD 000289-453-1032-9; and LSO Live CD LSO 0072.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==

After 1931 the work received no further gramophone recordings until [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]]'s 1950 recording. During the 1950s there was only one other new recording of the symphony, and in the 1960s there were only two. In the 1970s there were four new recordings. In the 1980s there were six, and the 1990s saw twelve. Ten new recordings were released in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=gram&gt;[http://www.gramophone.net Gramophone archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but exceptions include the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], [[Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra]], [[Dresden Staatskapelle]], and [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], and conductors [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Tadaaki Otaka]], [[André Previn]], [[Constantin Silvestri]], Giuseppe Sinopoli, and [[Leonard Slatkin]].&lt;ref name=gram/&gt;&lt;ref name=march/&gt;

[[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]]'s "Building a Library" feature, a comparative review of all available recordings, has considered the symphony three times since 1982. ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'', 2008 edition, contains two pages of reviews of the work. The two recordings recommended by both the BBC and ''The Penguin Guide'' are by Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1977) and [[Vernon Handley]] with the same orchestra (1979).&lt;ref name=march&gt;March, pp. 431–32&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3197">The '''Symphony in E-flat''', Op. 1, is the first published work composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]] during his apprenticeship with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. It is also his first composition for orchestra. Of classical structure, it is broadly influenced by Rimsky-Korsakov, [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; It was composed in 1905–1907 and revised in 1913. It lasts for about forty minutes.

== History ==
The score bears the dedication "To my dear teacher N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov". A private performance was given on 27 April 1907 by the St. Petersburg Court Orchestra conducted by H. Wahrlich, in a concert that also included the first performance of ''Faun and Shepherdess''.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Stravinsky later recalled that both Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov considered the orchestration "too heavy".&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; The first public performance was conducted by [[Felix Blumenfeld]] on 22 January 1908. A revised version was conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]] on 2 April 1914, and the composer conducted this version in his later performances.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 [[Western_concert_flute|flute]]s (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 3 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[percussion]] and [[string_section|strings]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

== Movements ==
=== Allegro moderato ===
The first movement is in [[sonata form]].&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

=== Scherzo ===
This movement was sometimes played alone at performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Stravinsky incorporated into it a Russian folk song similar to one he used in ''[[Petrushka]]''.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

=== Largo ===
The longest movement of the symphony, lasting almost fifteen minutes.

=== Finale ===
The finale is a rondo.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; As in the second movement, Stravinsky includes a popular song ("Tchitcher-Yatcher"). He used it again in his ''Trois petites chansons'' of 1913.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

== Discography ==
* Stravinsky's recording of this symphony in his collected works on ''Sony Classical'' was recorded by the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]] in May 1966.&lt;ref name=Sony/&gt;

'''''The Birds''''' comprises a pair of outdoor sculptures depicting [[house sparrow]]s by [[Myfanwy MacLeod]], installed after the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Southeast False Creek Olympic Plaza, which served as the site of the [[2010 Olympic Village]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/when-giant-sparrows-attack/article1211261/|title=When giant sparrows attack|date=May 15, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2014|first=Marsha|last=Lederman|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted&gt;{{cite web|first=Tuija |last=Seipell |url=http://www.jaunted.com/story/2010/8/1/163512/4307/travel/Vancouver%92s+Coolest+Public+Art%3A+The+Birds+at+the+Olympic+Village |title=Vancouver’s Coolest Public Art: The Birds at the Olympic Village |publisher=Jaunted |date=August 3, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts one male and one female house sparrow, each approximately five metres tall, and was the first piece approved by the city's Olympic and Paralympic Public Art Program.

They were removed on November 23, 2017 for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancourier.com/news/olympic-village-s-giant-birds-headed-east-for-repairs-1.23103495|title=Olympic Village’s giant birds headed east for repairs|last=|first=|date=November 23, 2017 |work=Vancouver Courrier|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Sculpture of a sparrow in Olympic Village, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of the house sparrows (2011)]]

''The Birds'' was the first work of public art to be approved under the city's Olympic and Paralympic Public Art Program.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; It was installed in Southeast False Creek Olympic Plaza, which served as the site of the [[2010 Olympic Village]], in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heavy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heavyindustries.ca/the-birds/|accessdate=September 7, 2014|publisher=Heavy Industries|title=the birds: the skinny by heavy industries}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacLeod was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[The Birds (film)|1963 film of the same name]]. She has said of the piece, "I think it boils down to wanting to make something sublime for the plaza – that is something beautiful, but frightening at the same time."&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; She has also said of its inspiration:

{{Quote|We have a very kind of romantic relationship to nature and I'm interested in playing with that romantic notion and kind of inverting it, sort of like how the birds attack in the film… And the scale of [the installation] has that similar effect, where our relationship to the birds has changed. Because normally when you're on the plaza, you see little birds and you're this giant thing. Here it's the opposite: You're the small thing in relationship to the giant birds.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;}}

''The Birds'' was also inspired by sustainability and the site's history as a shipyard, where sailors often wore sparrow tattoos. The sculptures have been called an "ode to immigration" based on MacLeod's interest in "alien species" and when non-native species are introduced to an environment (the house sparrow is not native to North America).&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; MacLeod said: "My work for the Olympic Village tries to infuse the ordinary and commonplace sparrow with a touch of the ridiculous and the sublime. Locating this artwork in an urban plaza not only highlights what has become the 'natural' environment of the sparrow, it also reinforces the 'small' problem of introducing a foreign species and the subsequent havoc wreaked upon our ecosystems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandesignresource.ca/nature/the-birds-installation/|title=The Birds Installation – Vancouver, British Columbia|accessdate=September 7, 2014|publisher=The Canadian Design Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures were produced by Heavy Industries, with some bodywork completed by Semi-Rigid Plastic Parts Repair.&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; ''The Birds'' was the last of the public art program's works to be installed, despite being the first approved.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Olympic Village, Vancouver (1).jpg|thumb|right|One of the sculptures in 2011]]

The work depicts one male and one female house sparrow, each between {{convert|4.5|and|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; or approximately {{nowrap|50 times}} life size.&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; The birds have been described as realistic and "massive yet friendly-looking".&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; Their bodies are made from hard coated [[Polystyrene#Expanded_polystyrene|expanded polystyrene]] (EPS) foam, coated with a [[polyurea]] skin and airbrush painted, all clad around a steel armature. Their cast bronze legs were sealed with wax. According to Heavy, the EPS form pieces were "glued together with pressure-sensitive adhesive, specifically formulated for bonding EPS to itself and other materials".&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt;

==Reception==
Marsha Lederman of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called the sculptures "huge and intimidating and a bit creepy", but acknowledged the artist's intent.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; Explaining connection between immigration and sparrows specifically, she wrote that the birds were introduced "to satisfy cultural nostalgia for homesick Europeans. The birds were alien, exotic. They're now ubiquitous. Part of the everyday landscape. Barely noticed… Not these."&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; Tuija Seipell of Jaunted said the sparrows were reminiscent of the bird that Flick and the Blueberries build to scare the Hoppers in the 1998 film ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt;

'''''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''''' (originally issued as '''''Vol. 3: The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''''') is the third [[album]] by [[United States|American]] [[fingerstyle guitar]]ist and composer [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], released in 1965. The 1999 reissue contained four previously unreleased tracks.

== History ==
In the early ’60s, Fahey was enrolled in the graduate program in folklore studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. In the summer of 1964, along with [[Bill Barth]] and [[Henry Vestine]], Fahey visited the South where they “rediscovered” blues great [[Skip James]].&lt;ref name = "Wire"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Pouncey | first = Edwin | authorlink =  | title = Blood on the Frets | journal = [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] | volume = | issue = 174| pages = | publisher = | location = | date = August 1998| url = http://www.johnfahey.com/Blood.htm | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fahey and [[ED Denson]] formally created Takoma Records in 1963. With increased distribution, Fahey's albums began to enjoy increased sales and popularity, though he had not as yet publicly performed on stage. As Matt Hanks stated in his article "Age Against the Machine" for ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'', "For some reason, the [[hippie]]s loved it."&lt;ref name="WCP"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dunlap Jr.| first = David| title = The Cosmos Club| journal = Washington City Paper| pages = | publisher = | date = July 7, 2006| url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2006/cover0707.html?navEdit| accessdate = March 10, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627200714/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2006/cover0707.html?navEdit| archivedate = June 27, 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Hanks| first =Matt| title =Age Against the Machine| journal =[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]| volume =| issue =May–June| pages =| publisher =| location =| year =1997| url =http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/05/age-against-the-machine/| issn =| doi =| id =| accessdate =March 17, 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120928155842/http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/05/age-against-the-machine/| archivedate =September 28, 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Fahey stated in his liner notes for his 1996 release ''[[City of Refuge (John Fahey album)|City of Refuge]]'', "I do hope that nobody will try to make me out as a child of the sixties. I was playing what I play before and after the sixties. This period had very little influence on me. I was never a hippie, and had no hippie friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= John |last= Fahey |title= Liner Notes: ''City of Refuge'' |url= http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/crnotes.html |publisher=  |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was recorded at Adelphi Studios by Gene Rosenthal. Rosenthal would later create [[Adelphi Records]], naming his label after Fahey's song "The Downfall of the Adelphi Rolling Grist Mill". He also claimed three other unused tracks from these sessions were used on subsequent releases by Fahey.&lt;ref name = "WCP" /&gt; Over 30 songs were recorded during the three-day sessions.&lt;ref name="LN"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lee|last= Gardner |title= ''Liner notes from 1999 reissue'' |url=  |publisher=  |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the sessions, Fahey recalled, ""It was an interesting session. It was the only one I ever did on marijuana and whiskey. It was kind of bouncy, you know. Another reason for that—I didn't actually own a good guitar at that time, so I was using Bill Barth's guitar, which was a big J-something Gibson and it had a real high action, so I couldn't hold the strings down very well."&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;

"The Last Steam Engine Train" was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Leo Kottke]] on his 1969 album ''[[12-String Blues]]'' and again on his 1973 album ''[[Greenhouse (Leo Kottke album)|Greenhouse]]''. 

"On the Banks of the Owchita" is a duet with guitarist [[Bill Barth]]. The 1999 reissue bonus track "[[Steel Guitar Rag]]" is based on "Guitar Rag",  [[Sylvester Weaver (musician)|Sylvester Weaver]]'s original version of the song. "Wine and Roses" was later re-titled as "The Red Pony". "Poor Boy" became a Fahey standard.&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/v32.html Song notes at The Fahey Files]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahey continued writing liner notes in a similar vein as his previous two releases, attributing them to "Elijah P. Lovejoy". The notes were extensive, pseudo-academic, and humorous — all included in a booklet, which would often be the case on early releases by Fahey. Andy Beta, of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' described Fahey's liner notes in a 2006 article: "Doctoring loquacious, ludicrous liner notes for his self-released work that tempered his arrogant self-mythologizing with hilarious self-effacement, he mocked the academic bluster of scholars and revivalists. He renames his Fonotone patron "Joseph Buzzard," records as Blind Joe Death, or else espouses his work as "expert" Elijah P. Lovejoy." and  noise guitarist and writer Alan Licht noted that Fahey "did as much to take folk out of the hands of squares as his music did," and he suffered lightly those that pined for the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beta |first=Andy |title= ''Looking for Blind Joe Death'' |journal=[[The Village Voice]]|issue= |date=January 2006 |url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-01-24/music/looking-for-blind-joe-death/|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notes on ''The Dance of Death'' included an extensive discography and the  basic theme of the notes is the search for John Fahey and his musical legacy:

:"Prior to his discovery in 1958 by a Takoma research team Fahey had played as a guitarist for a bluegrass band; often appearing with Bill Hancock and Greg Eldridge, but no recordings are known from this period. Sometime in 1956 he was smote to the ground by a bolt of lightning. Upon awakening he heard Blind Willie Johnson singing and from that time onward he ceased playing hillbilly and concentrated upon blues. His first recordings were made under somewhat mysterious circumstances for the Fonotone company—a pioneer in the folkfield.

:Shortly before she met her tragic end by impalement when a chair rung she was tuning slipped from place under terrific pressure, Mrs Petranick informed us that John had the knowledge to operate recording equipment and that he was a hypnotist. Evidently, he would go to Fonotone with Blind Joe Death and Blind Thomas. The next morning the A &amp; R man would awaken with a slight headache and a stack of unidentified masters. Needless to say this has left some ambiguity in the records of the company. We have here listed all recordings made by any of these artists, regardless of the name used on the label. While doubtless some of them are by Death or Thomas or even Firk, all of them are of considerable merit and we felt it best to take the risk of including a few too many, rather than risk leaving any out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Fahey |title= ''Original liner notes: The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''  |url= http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/v3note.html |publisher=Takoma Records |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liner notes for the 1999 reissue, Lee Gardner comments "[It] represents the first, best recorded declaration from Fahey that he was interested in transforming his music into a vehicle for personal expression that built on his influences but accepted none of their prosaic boundaries. Nowadays this sort of concept is a given. But it didn't exist until Fahey took it on, and precious few of those who have followed him took it farther than he did."&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;

In reviewing ''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites'' for [[Allmusic]], music critic [[Richie Unterberger]] called it "One of Fahey's less eccentric early efforts, featuring relatively straightforward instrumentals showcasing his deft finger work and occasional keening slide."&lt;ref name="AM" /&gt;

In his review of the 1999 reissue, Alex Henderson called the CD "...essentially a folk album, but a folk album with strong country and blues leanings... this album makes it clear that even back in 1964 Fahey was quite original."&lt;ref name="AM2" /&gt;

Music critic Ivan Emke referred to the original album as "the one that helped to launch his reputation. Much of it is inspired by the country blues and Delta sounds that he had been drawn to, and yet it was obvious that Fahey [was] taking the tunes to places they hadn't been before... a classic; it provides a snapshot of a musician in transition."&lt;ref name="DL" /&gt;

== Reissues ==
*The original cover of ''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites'' was simply a white cover with black lettering of the title. It was reissued by Takoma in 1967 with new artwork similar in style to that of the 1967 reissues of ''Blind Joe Death'' and ''Death Chants, Breakdowns &amp; Military Waltzes''.
*''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites'' was reissued by Takoma in 1999 on CD with four bonus tracks.

'''''The King's Sick Son''''' or '''''Antiochus and Stratonice''''' is a c.1700 painting by the Italian painter [[Antonio Bellucci]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]. Also painted by [[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease|David]] and [[The Illness of Antiochus|Ingres]], the subject is [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]] falling mortally ill after secretly falling in love with his father's new wife [[Stratonice of Syria]].

[[Goethe]] saw the painting as a young man and described it several times in ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (1821).

It was accessioned in 1950 as one of the thousand items donated to the institution by [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].&lt;ref name=phila&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51288.html |title=The Soothsayer's Recompense |date=1 January 2007 |work=[[The Philadelphia Museum of Art]] |access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was created in France, through a process of "squaring-up" in which De Chirico drew a version of the piece divided into nine squares, and subsequently used this draft to quickly create the fleshed-out painting.&lt;ref name=phila/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gale |first=Matthew |date=1 April 1988 |title=The Uncertainty of the Painter: De Chirico in 1913 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=130 |issue=1021 |pages=268–276 |jstor=883282 |publisher=Burlington Magazine Publications Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
The piece depicts an empty city square, a recurring motif in works by De Chirico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giorgio-de-Chirico#ref216264 |title=Giorgio de Chirico |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=30 June 2014 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=13 March 2016 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features a locomotive in the background, another recurring motif also found in ''[[Le Rêve Transformé]]'' and ''[[Gare Montparnasse (The Melancholy of Departure)]]''.

The statue at the center of the painting is meant to represent [[Ariadne]],&lt;ref name=dorment/&gt; who was the daughter of Minos, King of Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Homer |author-link=Homer |title=[[Odyssey]] |others=11.320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hesiod |author-link=Hesiod |title=[[Theogony]] |others=947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She assisted [[Theseus]] in his escape from the [[Labyrinth]], but he later abandoned her on the island of [[Naxos]]. Like the locomotive and empty square, Ariadne appears in other paintings by De Chirico.

"Technology as a Means to an End".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Timothy Binkley studied mathematics at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], earning a B.A. (1965) and an M.A. (1966). His PhD in philosophy, from [[University of Texas at Austin]] (1970), explored [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s use of language.

Binkley has lectured and taught at several colleges and universities in the United States, most notably at [[School of Visual Arts]] where he initiated the MFA Computer Art program, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/library/cyber/mirapaul/111397mirapaul.html "Salon's Digital Art Ends Up Flat."] Mirapaul, Matthew. ''The New York Times'', "Technology | Cybertimes", November 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he founded the New York Digital Salon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydigitalsalon.org/10/essay.php?essay=3 "The Stone Age of the Digital Arts"], Malina, Roger. ''Leonardo.'' New York Digital Salon, 10th Anniversary Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklinfurnace.org/goings_on/past_goings_on/2002/dove_020410.html "Meta-Forms"], Toni Dove, Dolores Zorreguita, et al., ''Franklin Furnace'', April 2002: Colgate University, Hamilton, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; an international exhibition of computer art.

He has exhibited his [[interactive art]] in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia.

==Philosophy==

Binkley postulates that twentieth-century art is a strongly self-critical discipline, which creates ideas free of traditional piece-specifying conventions including aesthetic parameters and qualities. The artwork is a piece, and a piece isn't necessarily an aesthetic object—or an object at all. Binkley states that anything that can be thought about or referred to can be labeled an artwork by an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/beardsley/1.html [[Monroe Beardsley]] ''Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism'', 1st ed.], 1958; 2d ed., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley argues that the computer is neither a medium nor a tool,&lt;ref&gt;[http://grahameweinbren.net/GW_Papers/Emulating%20the%20ErlKing.html "''The Erl King'' and its Digital Emulation"], Weinbren, Grahame. Martha Kinder and Tara McPherson (eds.), ''Interactive Frictions'', University of California Press, (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesis.lambertsblog.co.uk/?page_id=274 "Computer Art Thesis: A Critical Examination of Computer Art"], Lambert, Nick. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; since both media and tools have inherent characteristics that can be explored through an artist's gestures or physical events for mark-making. Instead, the computer is a chameleon-like or even promiscuous assistant, whose services can be applied to any number of tasks and whose capabilities can be defined endlessly from application to application. Binkley refers to the computer as a non-specific technology and an incorporeal metamedium. Yet the computer contains phenomena not found in other media: namely, a conceptual space where symbolic content can be modified using mathematical abstractions. The notion of an “original” and its consequent value are considered irrelevant, obsolete, or inapplicable to computer art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/61196135/The-problem-of-media-in-contemporary-art-theory-1960--1990 Van Der Meulen, Sjoukje. ''The Problem of Media in Contemporary Art Theory''], (2009): Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Binkley's philosophy extends beyond art and aesthetics to culture itself, whose foundations he believes we are overhauling through our involvement with computers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0vnDc2447IC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;ots=oedvUySRkj&amp;dq=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;pg=PA418#v=onepage&amp;q=Timothy%20Binkley%20digital%20culture&amp;f=false Rosen, Philip.

'''Vasyl Vasyltsiv''' ({{lang-uk|Васи́ль Васи́льців}}; born June 26, 1987) is an [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] singer and composer.

Vasyl Vasyltsiv was born on June 26, 1987 in [[Lviv]]. In spite of his young age, since writing his first song in 2001 Vasyltsiv has released nine albums (as of May 2008). Though only one of them came under official label (''Goldenhits'') Vasyltsiv is sometimes considered as "the face of Ukrainian underground" and "genius of pure simplicity".&lt;ref name="uaf"&gt;[http://uaformat.com/content/view/1383/39/ Український Формат - Крихітка Цахес на прізвисько Василь Васильців, або Перший столичний виступ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having graduated with honors as a "performer and orchestra conductor"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasilvasiltsiv.txnet.com/?action=bio Василь Васильців : Біографія&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vasyltsiv is yet frequently being criticised for [[tone deafness]], lack of vocal abilities and composing talent.&lt;ref name="uaf" /&gt; While being regarded as simple and naïve, Vasyltsiv's music is distinguished for its harmony and proportion.

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Wilhelm Kuhnert Hyäne 1905.jpg|thumb|250px|Hyena (1905)]]
'''Friedrich Wilhelm Kuhnert''' (September 18, 1865 – February 11, 1926) was a German [[painting|painter]], [[author]] and [[illustrator]], who specialized in [[Animal painting|animal images]].

==Personal life==
Kuhnert was born in [[Opole|Oppeln]] in 1865. In 1894, he married 18-year-old Emilie Caroline Wilhelmine Ottilie Alvine Herdikerhoff. They had a daughter, Emilie. The couple divorced in 1909 while Emilie was a student in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. Kuhnert married for the second time to Gerda Jankowski in 1913. In 1925, on his 60th birthday, she died. Kuhnert died on February 11, 1926 during a recovery stay in [[Flims]], Switzerland. His grave is in the Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf in Berlin.

==Professional life==
After the end of his technical-commercial apprenticeship at the age of 17, Kuhnert was a scholarship student at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] from 1883 to 1887. From his home in [[Berlin]], he embarked on travels to [[Scandinavia]], [[Egypt]], [[East Africa]] and [[India]] to make landscape and animal studies. His favorite motif was the African lion. In 1901 Kuhnert was the illustrator for zoologist [[Wilhelm Haacke|Johann Wilhelm Haacke]]'s book ''Animal Life on Earth''. In 1903, he became one of the many artists selected to provide illustrations and design [[trading card]]s for the Cologne chocolate company, [[Stollwerck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorenz, Detlef|title=Reklamekunst um 1900 (Advertising Art in the 1900s)|publisher=Künstlerlexikon für Sammelbilder, Reimer-Verlag|year=2000|ISBN=978-3-496-01220-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided some illustrations for the 1900 edition of [[Brehms Tierleben]].

Contrary to the practice of his peers, Kuhnert distinguished himself by sketching tropical animals in the wild, not in zoos. He made pictures by [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[etching]], [[watercolor]], and [[oil painting]]. Kuhnert is considered one of the most important German animal painters of his time. As he was not a professional hunter, it often took a great deal of effort to track down his subjects.

[[File:Master Clam Catches a Shrimp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Master Clam catching a Shrimp. Southern Song Dynasty, mid-13th century. Property of the Freer Sackler Gallery.]]
'''Xianzi''' ({{zh|t=蜆子}}), or '''Kensu''' in Japanese, also known as the Shrimp Eater, was a semi-historical [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]]/[[Zen]] monk, considered to be one of the “scattered sages,” who were deviant or otherwise unusual figures within the Chan tradition. Infamous for his iconoclastic breaking of the taboo on eating meat set forth in the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Code]] of monastic rules, the Shrimp Eater appears in several traditional Zen paintings as both a comedic figure that underscores the Zen tradition of humor, as well as an eccentric, enlightened individual.

== Sources ==
Most information on Xianzi comes from the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', a collection of hagiographies (1004-1007 C.E.) intended to highlight the “anti-textualism and iconoclasm of the Chan monks”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Absconding |date=2009 |publisher=Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Harvard Art Museum |author1=Pellizzi, Francesco |author2=Crow, Thomas |author3=Taws, Richard |author4=Casati, Roberto |isbn=9780873658546 |location=Cambridge, Mass |oclc=319493067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within this collection of hagiographies are many nontraditional Chan Buddhist figures, such as Xianzi, who never became patriarchs or abbots on their own, but whose stories were still considered vital for the transmission of Chan teachings. Additional information on Xianzi comes from the poems and inscriptions that monks wrote on paintings of him. One such inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Japanese painter Josetsu reads:
{{Quote|text=Zen believers say the origin [of all things] is emptiness&lt;br&gt;
An enlightened one like you – is there another?&lt;br&gt;
Cold or hot, just one plain robe is enough.&lt;br&gt;
Every day, carrying nets you accompany fishermen|sign=|source=Unknown}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Awakenings : Zen figure painting in medieval Japan |date=2007 |publisher=Japan Society |author1=Levine, Gregory P. A. |author2=Lippit, Yukio |others=Japan Society (New York, NY) Gallery |isbn=9780300119640 |location=New York |oclc=77256429}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xianzi,_the_Shrimp_Eater&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1 edit].&lt;/blockquote&gt;Since there is very little hard information on Xianzi other than what is written in the ''Transmission of the Lamp'', inscriptions such as these are important in understanding the context in which he was discussed, the role that he played in Zen teaching, as well as in filling in some of the basic details of his life story.

== Biography ==
[[File:Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp LACMA AC1994.139.1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp. Late 17th Century Japan.]]
It is recorded in the Jing-de Era Record that Xianzi lived in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was a pupil to [[Dongshan Liangjie]] 洞山良價, the founder of the [[Caodong school|Caodong]] 曹洞, or Sōtō, school of Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Zen : masters of meditation in images and writings |author1=Brinker, Helmut |date=1996 |publisher=Artibus Asiae |author2=Kanazawa, Hiroshi |others=Museum Rietberg |isbn=3907070623 |location=Zürich |oclc=34569329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was known to never have taken students of his own or teach the dharma&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sengai : master Zen painter |author1=Furuta, Shōkin |date=2000 |publisher=Kodansha International |author2=Tsukimura, Reiko |isbn=4770023286 |location=Tokyo |oclc=44059558}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sengai), Xianzi was renowned for his eccentricities. Specifically, he was known to catch and eat shrimp, clams, and prawns from nearby lakes and streams, despite the Buddhist prohibition against consuming meat. Paradoxically, Xianzi was said to have attained enlightenment a moment after he had caught a shrimp and was preparing himself to consume it. For this reason, he was understood to be an enlightened individual and carrier of the transmission, rather than a degenerate monk and rule breaker.

In addition to his eccentricities regarding the consumption of meat, Xianzi was known as a wanderer, never living in or belonging to an official monastery despite his lineage ties to the founder of one of Chinese preeminent schools of Chan Buddhism. Instead, he preferred to mingle with laypeople, spending most of his days catching his dinner. He did not wear the [[Kasaya (clothing)|elaborate robes]] of a more traditional Chinese monk, instead wearing the same ragged robe during both summer and winter. At night, he slept beneath the paper offerings at the [[White Horse Temple]], much as a homeless would in the modern day. Some have even speculated that he was crazy, although some secondary sources suggest that he was just feigning madness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Vinaya Code ===
The Vinaya was the set of rules and principles that governed many Buddhist monastic communities. Among these rules were prohibitions against having sexual intercourse, regulations on begging, and an iron-clad ban on eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The essentials of the Vinaya tradition |author=Gyōnen, Gishin |date=1995 |publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research |isbn=0962561894 |location=Berkeley, Calif. |oclc=35978564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks who broke these rules were said to have committed “[[Parajika|pārājika]],” or the eight misbehaviors and were declared “asaṃvāsa,” which means outside of the Buddhist religious community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Shayne|date=|title=When and Where Is a Monk No Longer a Monk? On Communion and Communities in Indian Buddhist Monastic Law Codes.|url=|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal|volume=52.2|pages=115–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those deemed outside of the Buddhist religious community were not excommunicated per se, but rather were seen as deviants who were not representative of the tradition that they espoused. As someone who routinely ate fish, Xianzi would have certainly been considered asaṃvāsa under the Vinaya Code. The very paintings of Xianzi violate the Vinaya Code to a certain degree, because scholarship shows that originally, the code prohibited humor and laughter, believing it to be counterproductive to a monk’s serious undertakings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other parts of the Vinaya Code insist on humility and poverty. The expensive, elaborate robes of high society were frowned on, and monks were supposed to wear the cast-off rags of society. Additionally, in the late 8th century, the Chan master Bozhang recognized the changing dynamics of monastic life, and created the Bozhang qinggui 百丈淸規, which were additional rules for monastic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The spirit of Zen : a way of life, work and art in the Far East |author=Watts, Alan |date=1960 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0802130569 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=8710916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new rules reformed the ways that monks obtained their food, mandating that monks devote part of their time not just to begging for alms, but instead providing some sort of labor, causing monks to work for their food. Many farms were set up alongside monasteries as a result. Although Xianzi did break some basic Vinaya rules, he also upheld others. His dress is simple and although his consumption of meat may have been blasphemous, he did fulfill the responsibility laid out in the Bozhang qinggui of laboring for his food.

=== Xianzi as a Symbol of Zen Humor ===
[[File:The Shrimp Eater.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The Shrimp Eater. Hanging scroll with inscription done by the monk-painter Muqi Fachang during mid-13th century China.]]
Humor is thought to be one of the defining elements of Chan/Zen teaching, and that humor is almost certainly reflected in the case of Xianzi. Some argue that Chan/Zen masters used humor as a means of conveying its essential wordless transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a similar way that [[Mahākāśyapa]] wordlessly received the transmission of the dharma through [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]] Buddha’s [[Flower Sermon|flower sermon]], so too will those who look upon a humorous Chan/Zen painting wordlessly receive the transmission, provided that they get the joke. Understanding humor requires rigor and training, because humor without full-mindedness is grotesque and meaningless, while full-mindedness without awareness of its limitations is empty. In this way, it is argued that Chan/Zen humor is used to replicate the experience of no-mind that Chan/Zen teachings are based on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Zen humor, as in the case of Xianzi, is typically irreverent and iconoclastic. The paradox of Xianzi is that even though he shamelessly breaks monastic rules by eating meat, that is the way in which he achieved enlightenment. An inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Chinese monk-painter [[Muqi Fachang]] 牧溪法常 (ca. 1210-ca. 1279) &lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;alludes to this, reading:
{{Quote|text=Picking up his net at random and dragging it through the mud,&lt;br&gt;
Wading across the water, illicit goods emerge before him&lt;br&gt;
He comes face to face with this troublesome taboo&lt;br&gt;
If the offering tray from the altar for the gods is missing,&lt;br&gt;
It is because in the end he never cast off the handiwork of demons|sign=|source=Unknown}}&lt;blockquote&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Kun. The Form of no-Form: Reconstructing Huineng in Two Paintings by Liang Kai. Order No. 10599033 University of Oregon, 2017 Ann Arbor ProQuest. 26 Mar. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This kind of irreverence for Buddhist teachings and traditions is repeated in other figures such as the ebullient [[Budai|Budai/Hotei]] 布袋, known literally as the laughing monk. It is speculated that the reason for Chan/Zen’s strong use of humor is that although Chan/Zen Buddhism held itself as being unique for having received the true transmission in an unbroken lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, in everyday life there were few things that separated Chan/Zen monks from those of other sects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They frequently lived in the same monasteries, abided by the same rules, and read the same sutras. Humor was used to differentiate Chan/Zen from the rest, because it made fun of the very precepts that all of the other schools adhered to so rigorously. By asserting its iconoclastic side, Chan/Zen teachings professed their true knowledge and possession of the transmission.

=== The Scattered Sages ===
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Zhutou.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Zhutou (Zhimeng.) Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Xianzi is one of several traditional Chan/Zen figures known as the “scattered sages,” many of which are depicted with in the same humorous, iconoclastic light. Examples of other Scattered Sages include the laughing monk Budai/Hotei, Tanka 丹霞 the icon burner, the Four Sleepers ([[Hanshan (poet)|Hanshan]] 寒山, [[Shide (monk)|Shide]] 拾得, [[Fenggan]] 豐干, and Fenggan’s tiger,) and Zhimeng 智猛.

Zhimeng in particular bears similarities to Xianzi, because he was a figure famous for eating pig’s heads as his favorite treat, much in the same way that Xianzi favored eating shrimp. As a result of their similarities, it was not uncommon for hanging scrolls of Xianzi and Zhimeng to be exhibited together. The artist Josetsu (1405-1496,) for instance, painted the two individually, but their paintings are strikingly similar and are displayed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.artsmia.org/art/122101/the-zen-eccentric-zhutou-right-of-a-pair-of-zhutou-and-xianzi-yogetsu|title=The Zen Eccentric Zhutou|last=|first=|date=|website=The Minneapolis Institute of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars theorize that many of the Scattered Sages actually predate Chan/Zen Buddhism and exist outside of its religious context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were absorbed into the Chan/Zen pantheon as a means of co-opting traditional Chinese culture, enhancing Chan/Zen’s cultural appeal and diverting local customs into a Buddhist framework. However, the evidence for this in the case of Xianzi is limited and no hard conclusions can be drawn.

== Visual Representation ==
[[File:Xianzi the Shrimp Eater (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Xianzi, the Shrimp Eater. Painted by the artist [[Kanō Tan'yū|Kano Tan'yu]] in the 17th century. Property of the Minneapolis Institute of Art.]]
Although his name can be translated as “Master Clam” and in his biography he is said to have eaten both shrimp and clams, Xianzi is always painted holding a shrimp in his hand and never a clam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he is frequently painted with his fishing net in one hand to show that he caught his prey himself. His beard is always painted with blurry grey brushstrokes, and although his robes are always relatively simple and never decorated or elaborate, sometimes they more closely resemble the traditional robes of monk, rather than those of a peasant. His humble lifestyle is never drawn into question and his poverty is always made clear. Lastly, all known paintings of Xianzi show him eating shrimp – details of his life outside of his shrimp-eating habit are sometimes alluded to in the inscriptions and poems written at the top of the painting, but they are never explicitly shown.
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Xianzi.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Xianzi. Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Much of Xianzi’s iconography remains the same from painting to painting, but there seem to be three general categories of depicting him; in one, Xianzi holds the shrimp above his head with his mouth open as if to eat it, while in the second he holds it in front of his face at eye level, intently examining it. In the former category, Xianzi is also frequently smiling and standing more informally, while in the latter category his posture is more restrained. Although when Xianzi is painted looking at the shrimp with his mouth closed he can either be wearing the robes of a monk or the simpler, more ragged robes of the destitute, he is never painted both with his mouth open to eat the shrimp and the robes of a monk. In those paintings, his dress is not representative of the monastic tradition. The third way in which Xianzi is painted shows him actually fishing, with one shrimp already in his hand to show what exactly he is doing. He is intent on his work and pursues no other activities.

Like many paintings done of the “scattered sages,” all paintings of Xianzi are done in the style of apparition painting. They are monochromatic ink paintings, frequently executed on hanging scrolls. The reason for the dominance of this particular style is that even though most paintings of Xianzi and other Scattered Sages were done by monk painters, it is understood that the audience they were trying to appeal to was the Chinese literati and scholastic community of Song Dynasty China, which preferred the apparition painting style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These paintings were frequently given as gifts to members of the scholar elite, and so they naturally reflected the tastes of their recipients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
