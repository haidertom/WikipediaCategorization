The '''''Allegory of Virtue and Vice''''' is a painting  by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], dating to 1505. It is housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]].

==History==
The painting originally formed the protective cover of the [[Portrait of Bernardo de' Rossi]], the [[bishop of Treviso]] who was Lotto's patron at the time.  When it was opened to display the portrait, the inscription (on the reverse of the ''Allegory'') would have been revealed:
{| 
! width="190px" align="left" | Inscription 
! width="190px" align="left" | English translation
|-
| BERNARD. RVBEVS || Bernardo Rossi
|-
| BERCETI COM. PONT || of Berceta, Papal Count [Bishop]
|-
| TARVIS. NAT. || of Treviso, age 
|-
| ANN. XXXVI. MENS. X.D.V. ||36 years, 10 months, 5 days,
|-
| LAVRENT.LOTVS P. CAL. || Painted by Lorenzo Lotto, 
|-
| IVL. M.D.V. || July 1, 1505
|} 

The painting was brought to [[Parma]] when de' Rossi fled [[Treviso]], and there it became part of the [[house of Farnese|Farnese]] collection, from which it was bought in 1803; after a series of different possessors, it arrived in the United States  in 1935, and was donated to the current museum four years later.

==Description==
The painting is an allegoric scene with the bishop's coat of arms lying on a tree in the center of the composition. The tree divides the latter in two parts corresponding to its two branches, one green and one dried. The former is associated to the allegory of Virtue, featuring a putto playing with books (a symbol of wisdom) and the symbols of the [[Liberal Arts]].

The right half shows a drunk [[silenus]], sleeping among the symbols of vice; to these, in the background, corresponds a valley with an easy access, but dark and including a forest, which is a symbol of getting lost without the divine light, as well as a boat sinking in a lake, a symbol of failure.

The theme is perhaps derived from an engraving by [[Albrecht Dürer]], which also includes a similar tree with moral symbols.

'''''Antônia''''' is a 2006 Brazilian drama [[musical film]] which tells the story of Antônia, an [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] [[girl group]] formed by four young women living on a ''[[favela]]'' of [[São Paulo]]. On their way to the mainstream success, they have to face with the [[violence]] near their homes and the ''[[sexism]]'' of the musical business. The film was directed by [[Tata Amaral]] and stars [[Negra Li]], [[Cindy Mendes]], [[Leilah Moreno]] and [[Quelynah]] as the members of the group.

It was shot in [[Santo André]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The film had its European premiere January 26, 2007 at the 36th [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], in the section "Cinema of the World: Time &amp; Tide". It was released commercially in the [[United States]] on September 21, 2007, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].

The movie, spun off from a 2006 short by Amaral, in turn spun off a [[television series]] from [[02 Filmes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in the filmmaker's native Brazil, starring the same actors in the same roles.&lt;ref name="bo"&gt;[http://www.boxoffice.com/moviedetail.aspx?movieid=5118 ''Box Office'' (Sept. 21, 2007): Review by Tim Cogshell]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On Vila Brasilândia, a ''[[favela]]'' (shanty town) of São Paulo, four [[Afro-Brazilian]] girls battle to fulfill their dream of making a living off their music. Friends since the childhood, Preta (Negra Li), Bárbarah (Leilah Moreno), Mayah (Quelynah&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt;) and Lena (Cindy Mendes, a.k.a. Maria Madalena,&lt;ref name="bo" /&gt; as Cindy) quit singing the [[backing vocals]] for a male [[rap music|rap]] group and form Antônia, their own group. Discovered by the smooth-talking manager Marcelo Diamante (Thaíde), they begin to sing rap, [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]] in bars and in middle-class parties.

Preta is the deep-voiced mother of a young daughter, Emília (Nathalye Cris). Mayah is the most sexually provocative though single and the high-voiced Lena lives alone with her boyfriend. Bárbarah is the sister of Duda (Chico Santo), an athletic young man with whom she frequently practices [[martial arts]]. Duda's exposed [[homosexuality]] brings a rising action into the story in which his gay partner is killed by a gang and Duda himself injured. Duda, however, recovers; despite this sudden crisis, the future begins to look bright again as the band Antônia begins to take flight.

Just when the dream of the quartet seems to becoming true, their hopes are dashed by daily events, such as [[poverty]], male oppression, and further street violence, which threaten the group and place the young women's friendship in jeopardy.

The conflict begins when Mayah flirts with Preta's estranged husband Ermano (Fernando Macário), and Preta forces Mayah out of the group, deciding to raise Emília by herself with the help of her parents. Next, Lena reveals that she is pregnant and must quit the group after her boyfriend, who originally wanted an abortion, puts pressure on her to do so if they are to raise the child. Bárbarah, meanwhile, is walking home one night with Preta when she is confronted and harassed by a young member of the same gang who attacked her brother; she defends herself using martial arts, throwing him heavily to the ground and resulting in his hospitalization. The boy dies in the hospital and Bárbarah is arrested and imprisoned for [[manslaughter]].

Preta, who struggles with her own personal troubles and the strain of raising her child alone, is the final member of Antônia left. At last unable to feel any desire to continue the group or rise to fame (as Marcelo encourages) if her friends cannot be with her, she goes to Mayah's house to apologize and reconcile. They, along with Lena, visit a grateful, teary-eyed Bárbarah in prison; they decide to spend their time with her writing a song about their experiences.

The scene changes to some point in the future in which all four members of Antônia are back together, singing onstage a liberation-themed song, ''Antônia''.

The story may lack complexity, but it is loaded with irrepressible energy and a deep appreciation of female friendship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/movies/21anto.html ''The New York Times'' (Sept. 21, 2007): Review by Jeannette Catsoulis]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it, "less a candy-coated inspirational pill and more a piece of solid dramatic fiction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931547.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 ''Variety'' (Sept. 11, 2006): Review by Robert Koehler]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audio engineer''' (also sometimes '''recording engineer''') helps to produce a [[sound recording|recording]] or a live performance, balancing and adjusting sound sources using [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[Effects unit|audio effects]], [[Live sound mixing|mixing]], reproduction, and [[Sound reinforcement system|reinforcement]] of sound. Audio engineers work on the "...technical aspect of recording—the placing of [[microphone]]s, [[pre-amp]] knobs, the setting of levels. The physical recording of any project is done by an engineer&amp;nbsp;... the nuts and bolts."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Phil_Ek_Interview.html |title=Interview with Phil Ek |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=Sep 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a creative hobby and profession where musical instruments and technology are used to produce [[sound]] for [[film]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[music]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careerplanning.about.com/od/occupations/p/audio_engineer.htm|title=Audio Engineer|author=Dawn Rosenberg McKay|work=About.com Careers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audio engineers also set up, sound check and do [[live sound mixing]] using a [[mixing console]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for music concerts, theatre, sports games and corporate events.

Alternatively, '''audio engineer''' can refer to a [[scientist]] or professional [[engineer]] who holds an engineering degree and who designs, develops and builds audio or musical technology working under terms such as [[acoustical engineering]], [[Electrical engineering|electronic/electrical engineering]] or (musical) [[signal processing]].&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{cite web|last=wiseGeek|title=What Is Audio Engineering?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-audio-engineering.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[Research and development]] audio engineers invent new technologies, equipment and techniques, to enhance the process and art of audio engineering.&lt;ref name="soundonsound.com"&gt;Daley, Dan, [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct04/articles/rocketscience.htm "The Engineers Who Changed Recording: Fathers Of Invention"], ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; They might design acoustical simulations of rooms, shape algorithms for [[audio signal processing]], specify the requirements for [[public address]] systems, carry out research on audible sound for [[video game console]] manufacturers, and other advanced fields of audio engineering. They might also be referred to as acoustic engineers.&lt;ref name="University of Salford"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Graduate Jobs in Acoustics|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=roles|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You|url=http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225726/http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2017-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{See also|Category:Audio engineering schools}}

Audio engineers working in [[research and development]] may come from backgrounds such as [[acoustics]], [[computer science]], [[broadcast engineering]], [[physics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[electronics]]. Audio engineering courses at university or college fall into two rough categories: (i) training in the creative use of audio as a sound engineer, and (ii) training in [[science]] or [[engineering]] topics, which then allows students to apply these concepts while pursuing a career developing audio technologies.  Audio training courses give you a good knowledge of technologies and their application to [[recording studio]] and [[sound reinforcement system]]s, but do not have sufficient mathematical and scientific content to allow you to get a job in research and development in the audio and acoustic industry.&lt;ref name="acoustics.salford.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|first=Acoustics|title=Physics and music technology degrees|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=physics-music-technology-degree|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RogStudioLongshot.jpg|thumb|Noted audio engineer [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]] at a vintage Neve recording console.]]

Audio engineers in [[research and development]] usually possess a [[bachelor's degree]], [[master's degree]] or higher qualification in [[acoustics]], [[physics]], [[computer science]] or another [[engineering]] discipline. They might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in [[architectural acoustics]].&lt;ref name="National Careers"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles: Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively they might work in audio companies (e.g. [[headphone]] manufacturer), or other industries that need audio expertise (e.g., [[automobile]] manufacturer), or carry out research in a university. Some positions, such as [[faculty (academic staff)]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]]. In [[Germany]] a ''Toningenieur'' is an audio engineer who designs, builds and repairs audio systems.

===Sub-disciplines===
The listed subdisciplines are based on PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]] with some revision.&lt;ref name="Acoustical Society of America"&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition—Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio signal processing====
Audio engineers develop [[audio signal processing]] algorithms to allow the electronic manipulation of audio signals. These can be processed at the heart of much audio production such as [[reverberation]], [[Auto-Tune]] or perceptual coding (e.g. [[mp3]] or [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]]). Alternatively, the algorithms might carry out [[echo cancellation]] on [[Skype]], or identify and categorize audio tracks through [[Music Information Retrieval]] (e.g., [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]]).&lt;ref name="Pohlmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlmann|first=Ken|title=Principles of Digital Audio, Sixth Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-166347-2|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architectural acoustics====
[[File:AcousticDiscsRoyalAlbertHall.JPG|thumb|Acoustic diffusing mushrooms hanging from the roof of the [[Royal Albert Hall]].]]

[[Architectural acoustics]] is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a room.&lt;ref name="Morfey 2001 32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; For audio engineers, architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a stadium or enhancing the quality of music in a theatre.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0-7506-0538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural Acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref name="National Careers" /&gt;

====Electroacoustics====
{{See also|Sound reinforcement system}}
[[File:Glastofriday2003.jpg|thumb|The Pyramid Stage]]

Electroacoustics is concerned with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound reproduction systems and recording technologies.&lt;ref name="ASA" /&gt; Examples of electroacoustic design include portable electronic devices (e.g. [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable media player]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s), sound systems in [[Architectural Acoustics|architectural acoustics]], [[surround sound]] and [[wave field synthesis]] in [[movie theater]] and [[vehicle audio]].

====Musical acoustics====
[[Musical acoustics]] is concerned with researching and describing the science of music. In audio engineering, this includes the design of electronic instruments such as [[synthesizers]]; the human voice (the [[physics]] and [[neurophysiology]] of [[singing]]); [[physical modeling]] of musical instruments; [[room acoustics]] of concert venues; [[music information retrieval]]; [[music therapy]], and the perception and cognition of [[music]].&lt;ref name="Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics TCMU of the Acoustical Society of America ASA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics (TCMU) of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) |url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/ |title=ASA TCMU Home Page |deadurl=yes |accessdate=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613120620/http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/ |archive-date=2001-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bader"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bader |first1=Rolf |editor1-last=Bader |editor1-first=Rolf |title=Springer Handbook of Systematic Musicology |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-662-55004-5 |pages=25-28 |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-55004-5#toc |accessdate=23 November 2018 |ref=rb |chapter=Musical Acoustics and Signal Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoacoustics====
[[Psychoacoustics]] is the scientific study of how humans respond to what they hear. At the heart of audio engineering are listeners who are the final arbitrator as to whether an audio design is successful, such as whether a [[binaural recording]] sounds immersive.&lt;ref name="Pohlmann" /&gt;

====Speech====
The production, computer processing and perception of [[speech]] is an important part of audio engineering. Ensuring speech is transmitted intelligibly, efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through mobile telephone systems are important areas of study.&lt;ref name="Speech Communication Technical Committee"&gt;{{cite web|last=Speech Communication Technical Committee |title=Speech Communication |url=http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/ |publisher=Acoustical Society of America |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604013140/http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/ |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioner==
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Congress Warsaw (963).jpg|thumb|[[Live sound mixing]]]]

A variety of terms are used to describe audio engineers who install or operate [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement]], or sound [[broadcasting]] equipment, including large and small format [[Mixing console|consoles]]. Terms such as "audio technician," "sound technician," "audio engineer," "audio technologist," "recording engineer," "sound mixer" and "sound engineer" can be ambiguous; depending on the context they may be synonymous, or they may refer to different roles in audio production. Such terms can refer to a person working in sound and music production; for instance, a "sound engineer" or "recording engineer" is commonly listed in the credits of commercial music recordings (as well as in other productions that include sound, such as movies). These titles can also refer to technicians who maintain professional audio equipment. Certain jurisdictions specifically prohibit the use of the title [[engineer]] to any individual not a registered member of a professional [[engineering]] licensing body.

In German, the "Tontechniker" (audio technician) is the one who operates the audio equipment and the "Tonmeister" (sound master) is a person who creates recordings or broadcasts of music, who is both deeply musically trained (in classical and non-classical genres), and who also has a detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of virtually all aspects of sound.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Education and training===
{{See also|Category:Audio engineering schools}}
Audio engineers come from backgrounds or postsecondary training in fields such as audio, [[fine arts]], [[broadcasting]], [[music]], or [[electrical engineering]]. Training in audio engineering and [[sound recording]] is offered by colleges and universities. Some audio engineers are [[autodidact]]s with no formal training, but who have attained professional skills in audio through extensive on-the-job experience.

==Training and background==

Audio engineers must have extensive knowledge of audio engineering principles and techniques. For instance, they must understand how audio signals travel, which equipment to use and when, how to mic different instruments and amplifiers, which microphones to use and how to position them to get the best quality recordings. In addition to technical knowledge, an audio engineer must have the ability to problem solve quickly. The best audio engineers also have a high degree of creativity that allow them to stand out amongst their peers. In the music realm, an audio engineer must also understand the types of sounds and tones that are expected in musical ensembles across different genres - [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] for example. This knowledge of musical style is typically learned from years of experience listening to and mixing music in recording or live sound contexts. For education and training, there are audio engineering schools all over the world. In [[North America]], the most notable being [[Full Sail University]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], [[United States]], and [[OIART]] (The [[Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology]]) in [[London, Ontario|London]], Canada.

In the [[recording studio]] environment, a sound engineer records, edits, manipulates, mixes, or [[Audio mastering|masters]] sound by technical means to realize the creative vision of the artist and [[record producer]].  While usually associated with music production, an audio engineer deals with sound for a wide range of applications, including [[post-production]] for [[video]] and [[film]], live sound reinforcement, [[advertising]], [[multimedia]], and broadcasting. In larger productions, an audio engineer is responsible for the technical aspects of a sound recording or other audio production, and works together with a record producer or director, although the engineer's role may also be integrated with that of the producer. In smaller productions and studios the sound engineer and producer are often the same person.

In typical sound reinforcement applications, audio engineers often assume the role of [[Record producer|producer]], making artistic and technical decisions, and sometimes even scheduling and budget decisions.&lt;ref name="Huber, D.M. 1995"&gt;Huber, D.M. (1995). ''Modern Recording Techniques''. (5th ed.). Burlington, MA: Focal Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role of women====
According to [[Women's Audio Mission]] (WAM), a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco dedicated to the advancement of [[women in music]] production and the recording arts, less than 5% of the people creating sound and media are women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058|title=Why are female record producers so rare?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The UK "Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, "...only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Women's Audio Mission was started in 2003 to address the lack of women in professional audio by training over 6,000 women and girls in the recording arts and is the only professional recording studio built and run by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=PPFA&amp;sw=w&amp;u=mlin|title=Gale - User Identification Form|website=Go.galegroup.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recording projects include the Grammy Award-winning [[Kronos Quartet]], [[Angelique Kidjo]] (2014 Grammy winner), author [[Salman Rushdie]], the Academy Award-nominated soundtrack to “Dirty Wars”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/54-2105425|title=Womens Audio Mission - GuideStar Profile|website=Guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van-Ahn Vo (NPR’s top 50 albums of 2013), Grammy-nominated [[St. Lawrence Quartet]], and [[world music]] artists [[Tanya Tagaq]] and [[Wu Man]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). [[Trina Shoemaker]] is a mixer, [[record producer]] and [[sound engineer]] who became the first woman to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album]] in 1998 for her work on ''[[The Globe Sessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction |last= Dunbar |first= Julie C.  |year= 2010 |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn= 0415875625 |page= 304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gail Davies]] was the '...first female producer in [[country music]], delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including "[[Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You]]," "[[Blue Heartache]]" and "[[I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)]]." &lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/women-account-for-less-than-5-percent-of-producers-and-engineers-andmdash-but-maybe-not-for-long/Content?oid=1597594|title=Women account for less than 5 percent of producers and engineers — but maybe not for long - Cover Story - Nashville Scene|work=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she moved to [[Nashville]] in 1976, men "...didn't want to work for a woman" and she was told women in the city were "...still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth." &lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

[[Wendy Waldman]], who became a producer after Davies, saw that Davies had a difficult time. When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told "...[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one"–a reference to Waldman.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
KK Proffitt, who is a studio "owner and chief engineer" states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]], Proffitt was told to "shut up" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; Proffitt said she finds "...finds sexism rampant in the industry".&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

Other notable women include:
 
*[[Sylvia Robinson]], early [[hip hop music]] producer
*[[Susan Rogers]], engineer for ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''
*[[Genya Ravan]], producer [[The Dead Boys]]' ''[[Young, Loud and Snotty]]'';
*[[Delia Derbyshire]], British electronics pioneer
*[[Lari White]], a co-producer on [[Toby Keith]]'s ''White Trash With Money''
*[[Leslie Ann Jones]]

===Sub-disciplines===
There are four distinct steps to commercial production of a recording: recording, editing, mixing, and mastering. Typically, each is performed by a sound engineer who specializes only in that part of production.
*Studio engineer – an engineer working within a studio facility, either with a producer or independently.
*Recording engineer – engineer who records sound.
*Assistant engineer – often employed in larger studios, allowing them to train to become full-time engineers.  They often assist full-time engineers with microphone setups, session breakdowns and in some cases, rough mixes.&lt;ref name="Huber, D.M. 1995"/&gt;				
*[[Mixing engineer]] –  a person who creates mixes of multi-track recordings. It is common to record a commercial record at one studio and have it mixed by different engineers in other studios.
*[[Mastering engineer]] – the person who masters the final mixed stereo tracks (or sometimes a series of audio stems, which consists in a mix of the main sections) that the mix engineer produces. The mastering engineer makes any final adjustments to the overall sound of the record in the final step before commercial duplication. Mastering engineers use principles of equalization, [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and [[Limiter|limiting]] to fine-tune the sound timbre and dynamics and to achieve a louder recording.
* Audio/sound designer – broadly an artist who produces sound tracks or sound effects content for media.					
*Live sound engineer
**Front of House (FOH) engineer, or A1.&lt;ref name="Front of House FOH Engineer"&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/front-house-foh-engineer "Front of House (FOH) Engineer"], ''Get in Media'' Entertainment Careers&lt;/ref&gt; – a person dealing with [[Live sound mixing|live sound reinforcement]]. This usually includes planning and installation of loudspeakers, cabling and equipment and mixing sound during the show. This may or may not include running the [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback sound]].  A live/sound reinforcement engineer hears source material and tries to correlate that sonic experience with system performance.&lt;ref name="Davis, G. 1990"&gt;Davis, G., Jones R. (1990). ''Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook''. (2nd ed.) Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;		
**Wireless microphone engineer, or A2. This position is responsible for wireless microphones during a theatre production, a sports event or a corporate event.
**Foldback or [[Monitor engineer]] – a person running foldback sound during a live event. The term "foldback" comes from the old practice of "folding back" audio signals from the [[front of house]] (FOH) mixing console to the stage so musicians can hear themselves while performing. Monitor engineers usually have a separate audio system from the FOH engineer and manipulate audio signals independently from what the audience hears so they can satisfy the requirements of each performer on stage. In-ear systems, digital and analog mixing consoles, and a variety of speaker enclosures are typically used by monitor engineers. In addition most monitor engineers must be familiar with wireless or RF (radio-frequency) equipment and must communicate personally with the artist(s) during each performance.
**Systems engineer – responsible for the design setup of modern PA systems, which are often very complex. A systems engineer is usually also referred to as a "crew chief" on tour and is responsible for the performance and day-to-day job requirements of the audio crew as a whole along with the FOH audio system. This is a sound-only position concerned with implementation, not to be confused with the interdisciplinary field of [[system engineering]], which typically requires a college degree.
*[[Re-recording mixer]] – a person in [[post-production]] who mixes audio tracks for [[feature films]] or [[television program]]s.

===Equipment===
[[Image:Roomcorrect-mag.png|thumb|Correcting a room's frequency response.]]

An audio engineer is proficient with different types of recording media, such as analog tape, digital multi-track recorders and workstations, and computer knowledge. With the advent of the digital age, it is increasingly important for the audio engineer to understand software and hardware integration, from synchronization to analog to digital transfers. In their daily work, audio engineers use many tools, including:
*[[Tape machine]]s
*[[Analog-to-digital converter]]s
*[[Digital-to-analog converter]]s
*[[Digital audio workstation]]s (DAWs)
*[[Dynamic range compression|Dynamic range compressors]]
*[[Data compression#Audio|Audio data compressors]]
*[[Music sequencer]]s
*[[Signal processor]]s
*[[Microphone]]s
*[[Preamplifier]]s
*[[Mixing console]]s

'''Audleystown Court Cairn''' is a [[Court cairn|dual court grave]] situated near the south shore of [[Strangford Lough]], north-west of [[Castle Ward]], 1.75 miles from [[Strangford]] village in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]], at grid ref: 562 504).&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland| year=1983 |title=Historic Monuments of Northern Ireland | publisher=HMSO | location=Belfast | pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained human and animal remains, as well as pottery and flint implements.

==Features==
It is a, now roofless, trapezoidal long cairn, with the sides revetted by dry-stone walling almost 27m long&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a shallow forecourt at each end opening into a burial gallery of four chambers.&lt;ref name="DOE"/&gt; The cairn material of local stone, survives to a height of 2–3&amp;nbsp;ft and was probably originally filled sufficiently highly to cover the heavy flags which roofed the burial galleries.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donnelly, JP  |author2=Donnelly, MM |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1980 |title=Downpatrick and Lecale. A Short Historical Guide | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic unit of a forecourt giving access to a gallery divided into four burial chambers is repeated at each end of the long, wedge-shaped mound, so that the two individual units almost, but not quite, meet back to back near the centre of the mound.&lt;ref name="HA"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harbinson, P| year=1992 |title=Guide to National and Historic Monuments of Ireland | publisher=Gill and Macmillan | location=Dublin | pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intervening gap of just over 2m. Traces of at least partial [[corbel]]ling of the galleries was found. The galleries are each about 10m in length, 1.2m in width and about 1.2 to 1.5m high.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite book | last=Waddell, J| year=2000 |title=The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland | publisher=Wordwell | location=Bray | pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dual court grave was discovered in 1946 by a farmer.&lt;ref name="DOE"/&gt;

==Excavations==
The site was excavated in 1952 by AEP (Pat) Collins of the Archaeological Survey.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mallory, JP  |author2=McNeill, TE |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1991 |title=the Archaeology of Ulster from Colonization to Plantation | publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, QUB | location=Belfast | pages=60 and 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial deposits included human bones and teeth, mammal bones, artefacts, burnt earth and charcoal. At least 34 individuals of both sexes and all ages were identified, with 17 in each gallery.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; In the northeast gallery the remains of ten individuals were found in the chamber and another seven in the second chamber, but there were no bones or grave goods in the third and fourth chambers.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; All the remains were disarticulated in such a way as to suggest that they must have been defleshed before being put in the tomb, and some were burned.&lt;ref name="HA"/&gt; Over 20 of the sets of bones were unburnt and had been placed in a defleshed condition, sometimes in small neatly arranged groups, at all levels in the burial deposits, which contained burnt bone throughout.&lt;ref name="WA"/&gt; At least 15 pottery vessels, reduced to fragments by roof collapse, were identified. Some were decorated, but most were plain Western Neolithic carinated bowls. Worked [[flint]] found included a large [[Javelin (weapon)|javelin]] head and 12 lozenge-shaped arrowheads, as well as a number of scrappers and knives.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; Two of the bowls found are exceptional in having lugs like vessels found in some tombs in [[Scotland]]. Fingertip fluting on three bowls makes them similar to bowls found in Scotland and the [[Isle of Man]]. The animal bones found included ox, sheep, goats, pig and dog or wolf, as well as bird bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Herity, M  |author2=Eogan, G |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1977 |title=Ireland in Prehistory | publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul | location=London | pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a food vessel and a horse bone found in one of the chambers.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not a classical one; it was invented by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Scaliger]] in his ''Poetics'' (published posthumously in 1561).&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Walker, ''Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961-1991'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8240-6697-9}}), p. 639; Scaliger wrote: "catastasis est vigor ac status fabulae, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunae tempestate, in quam subducta est."&lt;/ref&gt; It "is more or less equivalent to the ''summa epitasis'' of Donatus and Latomus and to what Willichius sometimes called the ''extrema epitasis'',"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin T. Herrick, ''Comic Theory in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of Illinois Press, 1950), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used in 1616 in England.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Magill, ''Critical Survey of Literary Theory: Authors, A-Sw'' (Salem Press, 1987: {{ISBN|0-89356-393-5}}), p. 1284.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial graffiti''' (also known as '''aerosol advertising''' or '''graffiti for hire''') is the commercial practice of [[graffiti]] artists being paid for their work. In [[New York City]] in particular, commercial graffiti is big business and since the 1980s has manifested itself in many of the major cities of Europe such as [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. Increasingly it has been used to promote video games and even feature prominently within them, reflecting a real life struggle between street artists and the law. Commercial graffiti has created significant controversy between those who view it as an effective medium of advertising amongst specific target audiences and those who believe that legal graffiti and advertising using it encourages illegal graffiti and crime.

Graffiti as a commercial activity dates back to [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Kipfer2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kipfer|first=Barbara Ann|title=Dictionary of artifacts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0dSbxl_MjZwC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1887-3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorganTsetskhladze2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Catherine|last2=Tsetskhladze|first2=Gocha R.|title=Attic fine pottery of the archaic to Hellenistic periods in Phanagoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g74RsWPeXkC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=September 2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13888-9|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; when pottery makers employed artists to decorate their items with motifs and intricate designs.&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|title=Classical Greece: ancient histories and modern archaeologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnJvha8jzzQC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45678-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern era, the phenomenon has been strongly associated with [[New York City]] since the late 1960s and the [[hip hop culture]] that emerged in the 1980s, according to a 1993 ''[[New York Times]]'' article that focused on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/style/too-legit-to-quit.html?scp=484&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1|title=Too Legit to Quit|first=Michel|last=Marriott|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=October 3, 1993|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "commercial graffiti" was used in an article by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as early as 1968 and used to describe activity in [[Chicago]] as early as 1970.&lt;ref name="HoffmannBailey1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Frank W.|last2=Bailey|first2=William G.|title=Arts &amp; entertainment fads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaAqgBIceEIC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=23 July 1990|publisher=Harrington Park Press|isbn=978-0-918393-72-2|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humanists1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fellowship of Religious Humanists|title=Religious humanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7MpAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1970|publisher=Fellowship of Religious Humanists.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[Times Square]] was referenced as featuring "commercial graffiti" through "Japanization", and more recently{{when|date=May 2011}} further "Japanization" of children's culture is cited to be taking place through forms of graffiti in video games and in the increasing popularity of Japanese innovations such as [[anime]].&lt;ref name="LLC1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=17 August 1981|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=17|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Mark I.|title=The Japanification of children's popular culture: from godzilla to miyazaki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDfaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5121-4|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, commercial graffiti has evidenced itself in [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="Price2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Vincent Barrett|title=Albuquerque: a city at the end of the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-MzbiOCmNUC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=18 April 2003|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3097-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major American cities&lt;ref name="BrodkinPearson1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brodkin|first1=Sylvia Z.|last2=Pearson|first2=Elizabeth J.|title=Native voices: a collection of modern essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4ZjY5De-qAC|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=1975|publisher=Globe Book Co.|isbn=978-0-87065-176-2|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and across Europe, particularly [[Paris]], and [[London]] and [[Berlin]] and features on the walls of numerous galleries across Europe.&lt;ref name="College2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=New Europe College|title=New Europe College regional program yearbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o_sAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 2003|publisher=New Europe College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing popularity and legitimization of graffiti, it has increasingly undergone commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] mascot), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." However, due to illegalities some of the street artists were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive and clean-up costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher = CNN|title = IBM's graffiti ads run afoul of city officials|url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/04/19/ibm.guerilla.idg/index.html |date= April 19, 2001|accessdate = 30 December 2010|first=James|last=Niccolai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Wired|title = Sony Draws Ire With PSP Graffiti|url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69741|date = December 5, 2005|accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Painted truck paris jnl 1.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial graffiti on a truck in Paris]]
The practice of commercial artistry is controversial,&lt;ref name="Eskilson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskilson|first=Stephen|title=Graphic design: a new history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdExAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=978-1-85669-512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; because many commercial establishments feel that professional graffiti art is a valuable form of advertising, while other businesses, law enforcement and others disagree. Legal and commercial graffiti is increasing and has created significant debate amongst graffiti writers and those associated with hip-hop culture.&lt;ref name="Iveson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iveson|first=Kurt|title=Publics and the city|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBiUnIeAIsMC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-2730-1|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary concern by those who oppose graffiti is that the tolerance of professional graffiti in one space leads to more illegal graffiti in other spaces. In some areas such as sports, over advertising in sports venues and even player uniforms in soccer has sometimes been viewed negatively.&lt;ref name="MurrayMurray1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Bill|last2=Murray|first2=William J.|title=The world's game: a history of soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRkIAcCB_0EC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06718-1|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial graffiti, seen as a frontier between the street world and the art world,&lt;ref name="Pereira2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pereira|first=Sandrine|title=Graffiti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBeftQGRSI8C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=25 May 2005|publisher=Silverback Books|isbn=978-2-7528-0181-4|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; is argued in some cases to promote a more responsible lifestyle for the graffiti artist through formal employment, which may range from actual graffiti advertising on buildings, to making prints and logos for clothing and gallery showcasing.&lt;ref name="Macdonald2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonald|first=Nancy|title=The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZnQg77NzxoC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=4 September 2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-78190-6|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy MacDonland in her book ''The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York'' argues that commercial graffiti artistry "moves writers out of the boundaries of the subculture", because artists "no longer paint for their peers and themselves, they have a new audience".&lt;ref name="Macdonald2001"/&gt;

Even in major cities such as New York City and Chicago, commercial graffiti has created some very mixed reactions. For instance in Chicago, despite a significant following in graffiti artistry, in the mid 1980s a commercial which featured a kid spraying "The end is near" caused considerable outrage by Chicago citizens who protested to the [[Ford Motor Company]] to take the commercial off air as they believed it encouraged children to freely graffiti property as they desire.&lt;ref name="Company1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Ebony Jr.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=November 1984|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=31|issn=0022-2984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2005, Peter Vallone Jr., a City Council member in New York and several other councilors protested against [[Sony]]'s decision to use graffiti commercially in their [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|PlayStation Portable]] advertising in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami as they believed it would have a negative influence on children and encourage them to deface property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/01/5988.ars|title=Sony asked to clean up NYC graffiti ads|publisher=Ars Technica|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial success==
[[File:Commercial graffiti, London.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial graffiti in [[Fashion Street]], [[London]]]]

In [[New York City]], legal graffiti and employment has become big business, appearing with owners' permission on everything from walls to railroad boxcars.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=Gregory J.|title=Graffiti lives: beyond the tag in New York's urban underground|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF4S3h0sVu0C&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=January 2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-4045-3|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cooper and Sciorra, many young graffiti artists are keen to use their talents and aspire to achieve entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; Local businesses employing well-known graffiti artists are also said to enhance their credibility and business-customer relationship as well as reducing crime by employment.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; One prominent group in New York City is the "King of Murals" which run a commercial graffiti business and have been employed to promote global brands such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[M&amp;M's]] in advertising campaigns and even hired by schools, hospitals and other healthcare groups to create artwork.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; Bronx-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies like [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. [[Smirnoff]] and even [[Microsoft]] have hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product.&lt;ref name="Forsyth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=Patrick|title=Marketing: A Guide to the Fundamentals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTBVY-Z9PvYC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2009|publisher=Bloomberg Press|isbn=978-1-57660-329-1|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Klughaus Gallery]] started [[Graffiti USA]], a company offering interior graffiti murals for companies. Their work includes murals at the corporate offices of [[Linked In]], [[Facebook]], [[MasterCard]], and [[ABC News]], which featured a Graffiti USA commissioned mural on October 8, 2014 episode of [[Nightline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/watch-artists-created-nightline-graffiti-mural-26063838 | title=abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/watch-artists-created-nightline-graffiti-mural-26063838| work=ABC News | date=9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a company named Alt Terrain specializes in hiring graffiti writers to paint legal murals as part of public performances which are hyped as "brand events" and may cost up to $12,500 for live performances.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt; In [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] for example, after the [[death of Michael Jackson]], Solomon "Disco" Stewart and a team of four artists named "The Berkshire Graffiti Network" for instance were paid to paint a "Michael Jackson Tribute" mural on the wall of a Pittsfield market on North Street.

In the United Kingdom, [[Covent Garden]]'s [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes of cross referencing would promote their store. Even the Israeli West Bank barrier has acted as a canvas for professional graffiti for hire teams. One Palestinian pacifist group will spray paint any message for 30 Euros, providing that it is not racist or violently motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,23304222001_1898860,00.html|title=Graffiti for Hire in the West Bank|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|first=Tim|last=McGirk|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Crimes website is the first to be established in the field of commercial graffiti and hires some sixty artists to produce artwork.&lt;ref name="Snyder2009"/&gt;

===In video games===
[[File:Feliz 1984.JPG|thumb|right|An example of crossover between [[video game culture]] and graffiti culture found on the [[Berlin Wall]] ]]
Graffiti has become an important part of video game culture, often reflecting the oppression facing graffiti artists in public and battle for it to be seen by the establishment as a legitimate and indeed a legal art form. The ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]] &lt;ref name="West2009"/&gt; and others such as ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Graffiti Kingdom: Playstation 2 Video Game Review|work =|publisher = Kidzworld|url = http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6032-graffiti-kingdom-playstation-2-video-game-review|accessdate = 30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Similarly ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), features a story line involving training in graffiti artistry and fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.&lt;ref name="Stang2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stang|first=Bendik|title=The book of games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cllMaThkYlIC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Book of Games|isbn=978-82-997378-0-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti, such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.

===In apparel===
Graffiti has become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] community in North America and abroad. Within the United States, graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8 Osiris or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ganz, Nicolas. "Graffiti World". New York. Abrams. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, The Mac etc. which have developed into gallery artists and at times do not even use their initial medium (spray paint) to produce artwork.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]], a well-known graffiti artist, contributed to bringing graffiti to the commercial mainstream.  In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works—which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities like bags and T-shirts.  Haring explained that, "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible.  It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art.  In other words, this was still art as statement". [[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = SOHH.com|title = Marc Ecko Hosts "Getting Up" Block Party For NYC Graffiti, But Mayor Is A Hater|url = http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7428 |date= August 17, 2005|accessdate =October 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is by the French crew, 123Klan. 123Klan founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, have gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style.&lt;ref name="Computer arts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0pUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so they have designed and produced, logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for numerous global firms.

===Tourism===
Most of the major cities across the world have graffiti and street art tours, often run by local graffiti artists who want to bring their talent to the public on a more socially accepted level.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Incredible Street Art Tours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/9880046/Incredible-street-art-tours.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally started with walking or biking tours around the cities, street art tours have expanded to include graffiti workshops, using graffiti art tools, stencils and spray cans.

Tours exist in New York, London, Berlin, Hamburg, Reykjavik, Barcelona, Montreal and Paris.&lt;ref name="Conde Nast Traveler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conde Nast Traveler|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-11-07/the-world-s-best-cities-for-street-art/|accessdate=30 November 2015|date=7 November 2014|publisher=Conde Nast Traveler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
Commercial graffiti is used as a type of marketing known as [[guerrilla marketing]] where one company has limited funds for advertising its product may it be goods or services. Generally done by smaller companies at the beginning due to small budgets but adopted by big brands (e.g. Coca-Cola&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_4vOUDImE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520161329/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts_4vOUDImE|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-05-20|title=coca cola connects india and pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This type of marketing has a way of going viral as it is done in a public place with limited resources but with new technology such as smart phones which can upload pictures and videos instantly to social media, so if there is legal permission by the government for graffiti people would do it during peak hours in communities for maximum exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Strategic Innovative Marketing (IC-SIM 2014), Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 12 February 2015 175:268-274|last=Ludmila, František|first=Navrátilová, Milichovský|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=268–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;( Navrátilová, L.

[[Death]] in [[children’s literature]] has changed over the course of history as both the average lifespan has increased and society's morals and beliefs and conceptions of children have changed.

==Early history==
Until about the 17th century, there was very little literature written specifically for children.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;Butler, Francelia. (1972) Death in Children’s Literature. ''Children’s Literature'' v.1(1), 104-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Oral storytelling]] and [[music]] accepted death as a matter-of-fact for both children and adults alike.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Since mortality rates for children were much higher then, the subject was not [[taboo]]. The restoration of life, life as a preparation for death, death as a form of sleep, [[immortality]], animals sacrificing themselves for humans, love as a conqueror of death, and inanimate objects that come to life were all common themes.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

Examples of the changing approach to death include: ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]], in which a boy is murdered by his stepmother, but comes back as a bird and kills the stepmother. The bird then turns back into a boy and is reunited with his father and sister. The stepmother, though, does not come back to life.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

===Morality lesson===
''[[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]]'' series contains numerous stories with references to death. In one instance, the reader is encouraged to live a good or “perfect” life in order to go to Heaven after death. In others, both animals and humans gain immortality.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Already the concept that bad people stay dead and good, loving people return to life is evident. A better-known example is ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', in which a character's death is just a sleep that is conquered by love.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; These themes are also seen in the Slavic story ''[[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]]'' and the retold versions of ''[[Le Morte d’Arthur]]'' by [[William Caxton]] and ''[[Robin Hood]]'' by [[Howard Pyle]].&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

[[Faith]] is also a factor in [[life]] and death. A well-known example is [[John Bunyan]]’s ''[[Pilgrim’s Progress]]'', originally written for children. Life is a journey of faith that will end at the gates of [[heaven]].&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Those having lived a good (in this case Christian) life, enter.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]’s original ''[[Little Mermaid]]'', the character must endure a journey, suffering and ultimately death for others, after which she is rewarded with an immortal [[soul]].&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; [[Aesop’s Fables]] also contain such references both in the versions written exclusively for adults and those for both children and adults.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

===Early humor===
Often death has even been the subject of jokes,&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; such as in the various versions of ''The Yellow Ribbon'', in which a young girl wears a yellow ribbon around her neck and a young boy asks her about it, but she puts him off. The two grow up together and eventually marry with the boy/man often asking her about the ribbon, but she continues to disregard the subject as “not important” or “not the right time”. Finally when they are very old, she consents to have him untie the ribbon, and her head falls off.

In ''[[Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland]]'', she jokes that if she falls and dies, she will be "quite a story back home".&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; There is also the [[Mother Goose]] rhyme in which [[Humpty Dumpty]] falls and dies, because he is an egg that breaks and can not be re-built.

===Scientific approach===
Later this somewhat philosophical or spiritual approach would be replaced by a more scientific approach wherein the illusion of death as a form of sleep is denied and the decomposition of bodies is discussed.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;  This viewpoint may have been popularized by Puritan beliefs that death is a punishment for sin.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; In favor of this argument would be such texts as [[James Janeway]]’s nonfiction ''A Token for Children: An Exact Account of the Conversion, Holy and Exemplary Lives and Joyful Deaths of Several Young Children''.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;Gibson, Lois Rauch and Zaidman, Laura M. (1991) Death in Children’s Literature: Taboo or Not Taboo? ''Children’s Literature Association Quarterly'' v.16(4): 232-234.&lt;/ref&gt; While life is still shown as fragile, emphasis is placed on the importance of salvation rather than on fantastical alternatives of rebirth as animals, immortality and such. [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s well-known ''[[Little Women]]'' alludes to the story of [[John Bunyan]]’s ''[[Pilgrim’s Progress]]'' at the same time that she shows the characters, including one who dies, on a journey through the house.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Even in this story one can see that opinions are changing as death becomes less of an expectation in society.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt;

==20th century to present==

===Death as plot device===
Death becomes more of a [[plot device]] at this time, such as in [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]’s ''[[A Little Princess]]'' and ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt;  Sarah Crewe’s parents die and she is sent to an orphanage. Mary Lennox’s parents are killed and she is sent to live with her uncle, who is still grieving for his wife and unwilling to even meet his son for fear that he will die as well. In ''[[Bambi]]'', the focal point of the story is the title character's survival through his mother's sacrifice.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt;

In these examples, death is treated much more subtly, alluded to as something that happened previously, not something to discuss frankly with children. In 1958, [[Margaret Wise Brown]] published ''The Dead Bird'', a simple picture book in which children find a dead bird. Just a few years later, children would hear about the deaths in the [[Vietnam War]] and the various political [[assassinations]].  These historical events may have had an effect on why some parents and educators now agree that death is a “fact of life” that is acceptable for children to be introduced to. At the same time, the cold, impersonal treatment of death begins to disappear in favor of the previous themes of leading a good life, love overcoming death, immortality, inanimate objects having or obtaining life, sacrificing one's life for others, and other such moral or "uplifting" themes. Still, even in the death-related books published in the 1970s and 1980s, [[feeling]]s about death are discussed with children only 35% of the time and comfort was slightly more likely to be physical (54%) than verbal (48%).&lt;ref name="seibert"&gt;Seibert, D. and Drolet, J.C. (1993) Death Themes in Literature for Children Ages 3–8. ''Journal of School Health'' v.63(2), 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuance===
In ''[[The Giving Tree]]'' by [[Shel Silverstein]], a [[tree]] sacrifices itself for a boy it loves. Then later, the boy returns as an old man to the tree stump and the two comfort each other. In ''[[Charlotte’s Web]]'' by [[E.B. White]], the [[pig]] Wilbur is afraid of death and the [[spider]], Charlotte, spends her life creating messages in her web in order to save him. When she dies, “she lives on through her 500 offspring” and through the love of Wilbur.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; In [[C.S. Lewis]]’s ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'', an allegory to the [[Christian]] belief in [[Jesus]], the lion [[Aslan]] sacrifices himself for the Pevinsey children and later resurrects in time to vanquish the White Witch. In [[Natalie Babbitt]]’s ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'', the Tucks have the fountain of eternal youth, but Winnie Foster chooses not to partake in this “life without death”.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt; [[Katherine Paterson]]’s character Jess in ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (novel)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' is confused over the accidental death of his friend, Leslie.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt;  In ''[[A Taste of Blackberries]]'' by [[Doris Buchanan Smith]], a child dies from an allergic reaction. In ''Admission to the Feast'' by Gunnel Beckman, and in ''Kira-Kira'' by [[Cynthia Kadohata]], a young character dies of cancer. In ''The Tenth Good Thing about Barney'' by [[Judith Viorst]], the last good thing about the deceased [[cat]], Barney, is that his decaying body helps the [[flowers]] to grow – a sort of “natural immortality”.&lt;ref name="corr1"&gt;Corr, Charles A. (2003) Pet Loss in Death-Related Literature for Children. ''Omega-Journal of Death and Dying v.48(4): 399-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of death concept===
The death of animals with or without human personalities is a popular way to introduce the topic to younger children. The death of an animal or inanimate object such as a plant made up 2% of the deaths in literature for children ages three to eight written in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="seibert" /&gt;  In Hemery's ''Not Just a Fish'', a young girl's [[fish]] dies and the girl deals with both her grief and the [[sympathy]] or disregard of others. This book actually shows a new [[Fads and trends|trend]] that exists in [[society]]: adults disregard for, or ignorance of, the grief of children.&lt;ref name="corr1" /&gt; In ''Tough Boris'' by Fox, a character shown previously as a gruff, fearless pirate is grief-stricken when his [[parrot]] dies. In Viorst's ''The Tenth Good Thing About Barney'', a child is challenged to think of good things about a lost pet named Barney, while he and his family prepare for memorial activities.&lt;ref name="corr1" /&gt; The use of animals allows the authors to broach the subject of replacing a loved one, such as in ''Charlotte’s Web'' when Charlotte's memory lives on through her children.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corr1" /&gt; More examples are available in ''[[The Yearling]]'' by [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]], ''[[The Black Stallion]]'' by [[Walter Farley]], ''[[Old Yeller]]'' by ''[[Fred Gipson]]'' and ''[[Where the Red Fern Grows]]'' by [[Wilson Rawls]].&lt;ref name="corr1" /&gt; One hypothesis for shielding children from death is that with the advent of modern [[medicine]] and changing attitudes about family, death is more removed from our lives than ever before.&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; For example, in Zolotow's ''My Grandson Lew'', a [[mother]] must admit to her six-year-old son that his [[grandfather]] and [[namesake]] has died and she did not tell him.&lt;ref name="corr2"&gt;Corr, Charles A. (2003) Spirituality in Death-Related Literature for Children. ''Omega-Journal of Death and Dying'' v.48(4): 365-381.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all the above examples having more the feel of the earlier themes of death, there are still scientific or formulaic approaches to death available for children, such as in the workbooks, ''They’re Part of the Family: Barklay and Eve Talk to Children About Pet Loss'' and ''Saying Goodbye to Your Pet: Children Can Learn to Cope with Grief''.&lt;ref name="corr1" /&gt;

Religious perspectives still play a role in the treatment of death. An estimated 40% of literature for children ages 3 to 8 written in the 1970s and 1980s gave indications of religious beliefs. While only 16% included affirmation of those beliefs, none include disapproval.&lt;ref name="seibert" /&gt; In one instance, a text even came under fire for being too vague in its description of the religious aspect of death: some readers took offense to [[Maria Shriver]]’s ''What’s Heaven?'', because it did not specifically mention [[Jesus]] and because it did not dwell on whether or not everyone went to [[heaven]].&lt;ref name="corr2" /&gt; Boritzer’s ''What is Death?'', published only a year later, seems to be a response of sorts to this issue since it shows a variety of opinions on death.&lt;ref name="corr2" /&gt; The lack of specifics does not appear to affect the popularity of ''Lifetimes: A Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children'' by Mellonie and Ingpen. The universality of death is a subject in ''[[The Big Wave]]'' by [[Pearl Buck]] and ''The Fall of Freddie the Leaf'' by Buscaglia.&lt;ref name="corr2" /&gt;

A study of 110 books written in the 1970s and 1980s for children ages 3 to 8 concluded that 85% were fiction, but in 80% of the books, the information about death was considered correct and death was presented as final. In only 28% of the books was the death considered an inevitability. In the 72% that included physical details of death, burial was most frequently mentioned. After that, the category of items most likely to be mentioned (in order) were the [[dead body]], a complete lack of physical details, the [[casket]], and the [[funeral home]]. Other identifiers such as the [[headstone]], [[organ donation]], [[morgue]], [[coroner]], death records and/or laws, the [[grave]] or [[cemetery]], [[embalming]] and [[autopsy]], and related themes were rarely, if ever, mentioned.

While "life after death" is only the subject of 31% of the books written for 3 to 8 year-olds that included death between 1970 and 1989,&lt;ref name="seibert" /&gt; the focus of ongoing memory as a method of immortality is seen in many texts, such as ''The Tenth Good Thing About Barney'', mentioned above.  In ''Dusty Was My Friend by Clardy'', a boy dies in an auto accident and the family shares their experiences and memories in order to continue with life.  In ''Mick Harte Was Here'' by [[Barbara Park]], a girl loses her brother to a [[bicycle]] accident because he did not have a helmet, and so she makes it her mission to remind people to wear helmets.  In ''Badger’s Parting Gifts'', by Varley, an old [[badger]] knows he will die and is concerned with giving his friends special [[memories]] to remember him.&lt;ref name="corr2" /&gt;

===Realistic approach===
Since the 1960s, literature for children is increasingly more realistic and “problem oriented”, so death is just one of many topics approached.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, Timothy E. and Mae, Reet (1987) Who Dies and Who Cries: Death and Bereavement in Children’s Literature. ''Journal of Communication'' v.37(4): 52-64.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[John Gunther]]’s ''[[Death Be Not Proud (book)|Death Be Not Proud]]'' is more realistic than many of the death-related texts written prior.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M.E. and Jones, J. (1986) When children die: death in current children’s literature and its use in a library. ''Bulletin of the Medical Library Association'' v.74(1): 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some studies have shown that there are [[gender]] factors affecting how the characters react to death and the experiences they have.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; According to the article ''Who Dies and Who Cries'', by Moore and Mae, males are more likely to show no visible signs of [[grief]] while females are more likely to express grief, particularly by [[crying]]. However males are slightly more likely to show [[anger]] and both are equally likely to [[social withdrawal|socially withdraw]] at first. Also, the reactions to long-term grief are less likely to be shown in all cases.&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; This can be seen in the more graphic details of deaths often depicted in texts aimed at males such as in ''[[My Brother Sam is Dead]]'' by [[James Lincoln Collier]] and [[Christopher Collier (historian)|Christopher Collier]].&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt;

Not only are the responses to death not even, neither are the subjects of death. In the literature for children ages 3 to 8 written in the 1970s and 1980s, where someone died, 51% of the deaths were adults, 28% were animals or [[plants]] and only 9% were children (six books). Of the adults who died, 91% were “grandparent age” and 9% were "[[parent]] age". However, when children died they were more likely to be [[elementary school]] age (67%) than [[high school]] age (33%). Of the deaths described, 74% were relatives, versus 21% who were non-relatives. The gender of the person dying was about even.&lt;ref name="seibert" /&gt; Often, the place or cause of death is not mentioned (42% and 49% respectively). Though it is estimated that at least half of actual deaths occur at a [[hospital]] or [[nursing home]], hospitals were the location for only 12% of deaths in the studied books. [[Diseases]] such as [[heart disease]] or [[pneumonia]], accidents and [[old age]] were the most likely causes, while seasonal changes, [[suicide]] and [[war]] accounted for three deaths.&lt;ref name="seibert" /&gt;

The '''Endeavor Talent Agency''' was a [[Beverly Hills]]-based talent agency founded by [[Ari Emanuel]], Rick Rosen, Tom Strickler, and David Greenblatt. It was launched in March 1995 and went on to represent a wide variety of acclaimed film and television stars. In April 2009, Emanuel and Endeavor executive [[Patrick Whitesell]] orchestrated a merger with [[William Morris Agency|The William Morris Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/news/william-morris-it-39-s-a-takeover-not-a-merger |title=It's A Takeover, Not A Merger |work= [[LA Weekly]] |date=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[William Morris Endeavor]].

==History==

=== Formation ===

The roots of Endeavor can be traced to the [[ICM Partners|ICM Agency]], where founders Emanuel, Rosen, Strickler, and Greenblatt were all top television agents. In early 1995, they formed a plan to start their own agency, which was ultimately discovered by ICM Chairman Jeff Berg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Galloway | first = Stephen | title = Jeff Berg Speaks: Plans for New Agency, What Really Happened at ICM (Exclusive) | date = 2013-03-05 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-berg-new-agency-icm-426189?page=show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, the four agents were fired from ICM and immediately formed Endeavor. The agency began operations on March 30, working mainly with television clients from an office above the former [[Islands Restaurant]] in South Beverly Hills. Co-founder Ari Emanuel and the Endeavor Agency were the basis for the character [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and his Miller Gold Agency, on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real-life Ari admits: I thought ‘Entourage’ would be a loser|url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/11/02/110211-gossip-ari-emanuel/|publisher=The Daily|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996–2003: Expansion / Whitesell Joins ===

In 1996, Endeavor moved to a new high-rise building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in [[Beverly Hills]]. Three new partners from [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]] quickly joined the company: David Lonner, Doug Robinson, and Adam Venit.  Lonner's clientele included the feature directors that Endeavor needed to solidify its standing as a full service agency.  Robinson and Venit were the first actors' agents and had a client list that included [[Hank Azaria]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[David Spade]] (all of whom are now represented by WME).

The Endeavor talent department grew dramatically during the next eight years, mainly with the 2001 addition of former CAA talent head, [[Patrick Whitesell]]. Whitesell led the development of the agency's list of feature film headliners, with a talent pool that included [[Ben Affleck]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Hugh Jackman]], and [[Jude Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brodesser | first = Claude | title = CAA’s Whitesell eyes a new Endeavor | date = 2001-02-25 | publisher = Variety | url = https://variety.com/2001/more/news/caa-s-whitesell-eyes-a-new-endeavor-1117794305/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also signed several comedy stars during that period, including [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Kevin James]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].

=== 2003–2009: Continued Growth ===

By 2003, Endeavor had become one of the industry's fastest-growing talent agencies. In June of that year, they relocated to 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, which is now the current headquarters of WME. The Wilshire office was designed by [[UCLA]] professor and architect [[Neil Denari]] with wall graphics by 2x4 of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmda-inc.com/index_content.html Neil M. Denari Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214072255/http://www.nmda-inc.com/index_content.html |date=2007-12-14 }} Official site&lt;/ref&gt; For this project, ''NMDA Inc.'', the company of Neil Denari, and associate architect ''Interior Architects'' received the ''2007 Institute Honor Award  for Interior Architecture'' from the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Tinder, [http://www.aia.org/release_011207_honoraward 2007 "AIA Honor Awards Recognize Excellence in Architecture, Interiors, and Urban Design"].

In 2006, agent Nancy Josephson left ICM after the company went through an ownership change.  Endeavor quickly brought in Josephson and her clients{{spaced ndash}} ''[[Friends]]'' creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane, [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Tyra Banks]], and director David Frankel.  Soon after, ICM agents Matt Solo and Robert Newman joined as well.  Solo's roster included ''[[The Shield]]'' creator Shawn Ryan, while Newman's brought esteemed film directors [[Guillermo Del Toro]], [[Baz Luhrmann]], [[Danny Boyle]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]].

2008 brought four key additions from [[United Talent Agency|UTA]], including talent agents Sharon Jackson and Nick Stevens.  Their clients, [[Will Arnett]], [[Jack Black]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Ben Stiller]], bolstered the agency's comedy department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=Agents Replaying a Hollywood Drama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/media/27agent.html?_r=3&amp;sq=endeavor&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 - Present ===
{{main|William Morris Endeavor}}

In 2008, Emanuel and Whitesell began preliminary discussions with the William Morris Agency about a company merger. By April 2009, the announcement was made and '''William Morris Endeavor''' was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = Latest WMA-Endeavor Merger Update: Hollywood History In The Making Today: Endeavor And William Morris Vote Yes | date = 2009-04-27 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/04/latest-wma-endeavor-merger-update/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WMA ultimately relocated to Endeavor's Beverly Hills office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = WME Will Stay In Endeavor Headquarters Instead Of Moving To New Morris Building | date = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Deadline | url = http://www.deadline.com/2009/10/wme-not-moving-to-new-building-instead-will-stay-in-endeavor-headquarters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emanuel and Whitesell retained the titles of Co-CEOs.

The '''''Fountain of Neptune''''' ({{lang-it|Fontana del Nettuno}}) is a fountain in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], situated on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] (Signoria square), in front of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. Made of marble and bronze, the fountain was commissioned in 1565 and designed by Baccio Bandinelli. It is the work of the sculptor [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]] with some elements created by collaborators. For example, the bronze sea-horses are the work of Giovanni da Bologna, often called [[Giambologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UIYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+bronze+sea-horses+by+Giovanni+da+Bologna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikp_Ss4-jUAhUjw4MKHUc0CeoQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+bronze+sea-horses+by+Giovanni+da+Bologna&amp;f=false|title=Walks in Florence and Its Environs|first1=Susan|last1=Horner|first2=Joanna B.|last2=Horner|date=9 August 1884|page=199|publisher=Smith|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

In 1559, [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] launched a competition to design a fountain at a time when a new aqueduct was also being built, the first to bring running water to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/arts/13iht-ammannati13.html|title=In Florence, Revelations in Stone|first=Roderick Conway|last=Morris|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for a statue of Neptune as the primary element, in a chariot drawn by sea-horses, symbolizing Florence's command of the Mediterranean. Initially, Baccio Bandinelli was the sculptor chosen but he died before work began. Sculptor Ammannati was hired to take over and completed the work with assistants and collaborators. The face of Neptune is said to resemble that of the Grand Duke Cosimo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFB6V8TekrcC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+face+of+cosimo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+face+of+cosimo&amp;f=false,|title=Renaissance Florence: A Social History|first1=Roger J.|last1=Crum|first2=Roger J.|last2=Crum|first3=John T.|last3=Paoletti|date=3 April 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=133|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4.2 meter tall Neptune figure, made of Apuan marble, was completed in 1565 in time for the wedding of Francesco de' Medici I to grand duchess Johanna of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/Palazzo_vecchio.html|title=Palazzo Vecchio and Piazza Signoria - Florence|website=Museumsinflorence.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Florentines were not impressed and called the statue "Il Biancone" ("the white giant").&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/art-culture/2016/07/new-life-neptune-fountain/|title=New life for the Neptune Fountain - The Florentine|date=12 July 2016|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFhVehAvVyUC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence&amp;f=false|title=Art in Renaissance Italy|first1=John T.|last1=Paoletti|first2=Gary M.|last2=Radke|date=9 August 2018|page=460|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work on the basin and other aspects of the fountain required nearly ten years. Ammannati and his collaborators added around the perimeter of the basin in a [[mannerist]] style, reclining, bronze river gods, laughing [[satyr]]s and marble [[sea-horse]]s emerging from the water. The pedestal on which the statue stands is in the center of the octagonal fountain. It is decorated with the mythical figures of [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]. The final work was completed in December 1574. The statue on display today is a copy made in the 1800s when the original was moved to the National Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6lkr32g6y8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE+%5B%5BScylla%5D%5D+and+%5B%5BCharybdis%5D%5D.++florence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OYKZKWJ1Xk&amp;sig=CoQowv5zaHU2FV0HeChtzYgIbd0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-x-at3ujUAhWq1IMKHXbCBCMQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE+%5B%5BScylla%5D%5D+and+%5B%5BCharybdis%5D%5D.++florence&amp;f=false|title=Three Months in Florence|first=Mary|last=Carter|date=30 July 2013|page=59|publisher=Kensington Books|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"/&gt;

The fountain has suffered a great deal of damage during the centuries. It was used as a washbasin for inkpots and laundry at the end of the 16th century. It was vandalized on January 25, 1580. A satyr was stolen during the carnival in 1830. It was damaged again by the Bourbon bombardments of 1848. Subsequently, it has been the object of several restorations and substitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/lifestyle/2011/05/the-white-giant/|title=The White Giant - The Florentine|date=19 May 2011|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2005, the statue was the target of three [[vandals]] who climbed it, damaging one of the hands and the [[trident]] of Neptune. The act was recorded by [[security camera]]s. The statue was restored by 2007. Since then, security on the fountain has been taken very seriously. In late 2007, the statue was the target of attempted vandalism by four teens. The security cameras and nearby police ensured that no damage came to the fountain again and the four were arrested.

Although the damage was repaired, the fountain is undergoing a general restoration that started in September 2016 and is expected to conclude in 2018; during this time, the fountain is surrounded by a protective cage and sometimes, by scaffolding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florencedailynews.com/2017/02/27/the-fountain-of-neptune-under-restoration-in-florence/|title=The Fountain of Neptune under restoration - Florence Daily News|date=27 February 2017|website=Florencedailynews.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"/&gt;

==Similar statuary==
As would be expected, the Sea-God, Neptune is a frequent theme for fountains, and over a dozen [[Fountain of Neptune (disambiguation)|Fountains of Neptune]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; exist. In Florence, there is another fountain of Neptune is found in the [[Boboli Gardens]], behind the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence. [[Giambologna]] sculpted a similar statue for the [[Fountain of Neptune, Bologna|similar fountain]] in [[Bologna]] in the 1560s. [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]] created a nearly contemporary fountain in [[Messina]], Sicily. The [[Fountain of Neptune, Rome]] (Neptune fighting with an octopus) was completed in 1878 when the statue was added by Antonio della Bitta and sea creatures by [[Gregorio Zappalà]] for the theme "Nereids with cupids and walruses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutroma.com/Fountains-of-Rome.html|title=About Rome: Fountains of Rome|website=Aboutroma.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original basin was designed in 1574, by [[Giacomo Della Porta]], and built at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaviva.com/Piazza-Navona/neptune_fountain.htm|title=Romaviva.com: Hotel a Roma - Prenota ora Alberghi e B&amp;B Roma|website=Roma Viva|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FourArgumentsForTheEliminationOfTelevision 0.jpg|thumb|1st edition (publ. [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]])]]
'''''Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television''''' (1978) is a book by [[Jerry Mander]], who argues that many of the problems with television are inherent in the medium and technology itself, and thus cannot be reformed.

Mander spent 15 years in the advertising business, including five as president and partner of [[Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage]], San Francisco, a nationally-known advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television|last= Mander|first= Jerry|authorlink= Jerry Mander|year= 1978|origyear= First copyright 1977|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|location= [[New York City|New York, New York]]|isbn= 978-0-688-08274-1|page= 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's summary==

In an interview with Nancho.net's W. David Kubiak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |title=Nancho Consults Jerry Mander |author=W. David Kubiak |accessdate=2010-11-09 |quote=They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908003052/http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mander summarizes his book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Well, one of the points of the book is that you really can't summarize complex information. And that television is a medium of summary or reductionism – it reduces everything to slogans. And that's one criticism of it, that it requires everything to be packaged and reduced and announced in a slogan-type form.

But let me say this: the book is not really four arguments, it's really hundreds of arguments broken down into four categories. And the categories have to do with a variety of effects that are not normally discussed. Most criticisms of television have to do with the [[television program]] content. People say if there is less violence on television or less sexism on television, or less this or less that, television would be better. If there were more programs about this or more programs about that, then we'd have "good television".

My own feeling is that that is true – that it's very important to improve the program content  – but that television has effects, very important effects, aside from the content, and they may be more important. They organize society in a certain way. They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. It changes family relationships. It changes understandings of nature. It flattens perception so that information, which you need a fair amount of complexity to understand it as you would get from reading, this information is flattened down to a very reduced form on television. And the medium has inherent qualities which cause it to be that way.

And the book is really about television considered from a holistic point of view, from a biological point of view – perceptual, environmental, political, social, experiential, as well as the concrete problems of whether a program is silly or not. But other people deal with that very well. My job was to talk about television from many of these other dimensions which are not usually discussed.

'''Garros Galería''' or Garros Gallery is located in [[Colonia Roma]] in [[Mexico City]]. It is the only art gallery and museum dedicated to cats in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="esquivel"&gt;{{cite news |title= Convierta su afición en una próspera actividad empresarial |author= Gerardo Esquivel |newspaper= Empresas y Empresarios |location=Mexico City |date=June 29, 2008 |page=5  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Convert their passion into a prosperous enterprise }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The enterprise was begun by siblings Joel and María del Carmen Nava Polina, along with Rodrigo Moreno González, who realized that there were cat museums in the United States, Canada and the [[Bahamas]] but not in Mexico. Both come from a family of cat lovers with fifteen cats between them currently. They had also built a large collection of cat-related items over the years. The gallery began in 2006 by gathering various artists and friends to donate and put works for the gallery on consignment.&lt;ref name="arosas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arte felino, negocio sagrado |author=Ana María Rosas |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/46581.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=April 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Feline art, sacred business |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623220810/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/46581.html |archivedate=June 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the gallery has had success because it caters to a niche market which had not been served previously. Sales have included those to Europe through the Internet.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;

Since it opened, the gallery has been featured on various television shows including [[TV Azteca]] and [[Once TV México|Once TV]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/user/garrosccr |title=Garros Todo en Gatos Galería |publisher=Garros Galería |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in Colonia Roma, which is known for having a large number of galleries, boutiques and specialty stores.&lt;ref name="laruta"&gt;{{cite news |title= Colonia Roma: La Ruta del Diseño |newspaper= Publimetro |location=Mexico City |date=January 11, 2008 |page=12  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Colonia Roma: The Design Route }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the gallery is dedicated to art and [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts]] with cat themes with the aim of supporting artists and artisans both from Mexico and abroad as well as promoting cats aesthetically.&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt;  It works with over one hundred designers, artists and artisans to create its line of products.&lt;ref name="laruta"/&gt; The catalog includes over 5,000 pieces which includes handcrafts, pillows, paintings, T-shirts, jewelry, cups, toys, photographs, watches and books. Prices range from twenty pesos for a lollipop and 45 pesos for earrings to over 8,000 for an oil painting.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt; The merchandise focuses on original art and handcrafts, ensuring that customers are buying items available nowhere else and not buying knock offs or illegal copies of commercial products. Customers include cat aficionados or friends/family of such, curious people who pass by the site and tourists.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luzhaw"&gt;{{cite news |title= Atraen con arte a amantes de los gatos |newspaper= Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 29, 2006 |page=12  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Attract lovers of cats with art }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the creators who work with the gallery include Daniel Soler, Serioshka Hellmund, Roxana Elvridge-Thomas, Ricardo Ham, Karina Falcón, Iris México, Miguel Ángel Tenorio, Guillermo León, James Tomon and [[Ana Karen Allende]].&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

The logo for the gallery is “El gato Dedrita” (Dedrita the cat) designed by Joel Nava Polina which represents the playful nature of cats and of their admirers.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

The gallery also sponsors exhibitions and other events not related to cats but with the aim of promoting local artists.&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt; It has shown works by artists such as Jesús Topete, Fumiko Nakashima and Kodai Kita.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

==Gato Sombra==
The Gato Sombra is a painting of a cat which was owned by artist Odette Paz before it died. The painting has its own niche in the gallery where it is claimed by the artist and others to grant favors for those petitioners who believe in it.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;  Petitioners write small notes to leave with the image.&lt;ref name="tvazteca"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Garros Bazar Artístico Temático Todo en Gatos |episodelink= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suPTks7hbQ0&amp;list=UU8AlV1qZP2PZCiUJJzNOFnA&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plcp&amp;noredirect=1 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |series=Venga La Alegria |network=TV Azteca |location=Mexico City |date= May 6, 2008  |time=11:37 am |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery also sells small images with a prayer.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The gallery has a room dedicated to temporary art exhibits which are not necessarily related to cats. It specializes in work by up-and-coming artists, especially those from the Japanese community in Mexico City such as [[Fumiko Nakashima]] and [[Satoji Matoba]].&lt;ref name="conmemora"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nava Polina |first= Joel |date=April 2012 |title= Arte public que conmemora un ‘nuevo tipo’ de paz.

[[Image:Girdlebook-NewHaven-YUL-MS084.jpg|thumb|260px|An open girdle book. Note the tied knot used for easy holding and the relatively small size of the book itself.]]

'''Girdle books'''&lt;ref&gt;See Also: "girdle-books"  ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Renaissance''. Gordon Campbell. Oxford University Press, 2003.  Xavier University.  27 April 2010  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t175.e1644]&lt;/ref&gt; were small portable books worn by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] European [[monk]]s, clergymen and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] nobles as a popular accessory to [[medieval costume]], between the 13th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kup, "A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book", ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''. 43/6 (June 1939), 481.&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of a book whose leather binding continued loose below the cover of the book in a long tapered tail with a large knot at the end which could be tucked into one's [[girdle]] or belt. The knot was usually strips of leather woven together for durability. The book hung upside down and backwards so that when swung upwards it was ready for reading. The books were normally religious: a cleric's daily Office, or for lay persons (especially women) a [[Book of Hours]].  One of the best known texts to become a girdle book is Boethius's ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', although it is the only surviving philosophical/theological girdle book. Women especially wore the girdle book out of convenience since it was already fashionable, at least in the 15th century, to wear a girdle belt above the waistline.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Geoff and Pritchard, Frances. et al. "Girdles" ''Dress Accessories'': c.1150-c.1450 Museum of London, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; A book secured on the [[girdle|girdle belt]] served both the utilitarian function of enabling hands-free carrying and protecting valuable books from theft and the elements. It also made a visible statement of social position, wealth and learning (or at least literacy).&lt;ref&gt;Margit Smith and Jim Bloxam. "The Medieval Girdle Book Project" V3.N4. ''International Journal of the Book'' Melbourne, Australia, 2005. Pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritative figures, saints or apostles like St. Jerome were often depicted holding girdle books.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Clemens &amp; Timothy Graham. ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies''. Cornell U Press. 2007. Pg 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Girdle books also appeared to be a fashionable accessory for lay women, adding to the decorative efforts already invested in the creation of a girdle belt. Artistic depictions of the girdle book confirm their popularity as an accessory.&lt;ref&gt;"Girdles" Pg. 35-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girdle books first appeared in the late 13th century and gained popularity through the 15th sometimes becoming ostentatious jewel-encrusted presentation books and falling out of favour late in the 16th century, when printed books had become much more common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aelflaed.homemail.com.au/doco/girdlebook.html "Girdle Book Slip-Cover"], Crispin Sexi (Jaysen Ollerenshaw), 2005. Accessed December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for their decline was the relatively small number of specialized girdle-protected texts becoming outdated with little need to replace them. In an environment of increasingly cheap printing it was simpler to replicate texts than spend time preserving individual [[manuscript]]s. The intricately constructed girdle bindings were simply impractical after a certain point.

There are hundreds of artistic representations of girdle books. Their popularity in art indicates a much wider distribution and adoption of the girdle book as a binding than surviving copies suggest.  A list of 150 examples "shows the proportion of representation in painting and in sculpture [as] almost equal." However, only 23 medieval girdle books have survived in their original binding, the oldest datable example being from Kastl, Germany (ca. 1453).&lt;ref&gt;Bruckner, Ursula, Bruckner, "Beutelbuch-Originale", ''Studien zum Buch- und Biblionthekswesen 9 (1995): 5-23. See also: [http://www.nypl.org/press/2002/liturgical.cfm " Rare and Beautiful Liturgical Manuscripts on Display at The New York Public Library"]. Accessed December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At least part of the reason for the small number of surviving examples stems from the fact that the use of the girdle book was largely confined to a narrow area from the Netherlands to the Upper Rhine Valley.&lt;ref&gt;"A Fifteenth Century Girdle Book" Pg 481&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Girdle books were a variant on other forms of medieval [[book-binding]] in which the leather or cloth continued loose beyond the edges of the hard cover. Especially for small personal books like the Book of Hours, the leather often extended sideways, which gave extra protection for the book when not in use - the loose edges could be wrapped round, and often buckles or laces enabled the book to be securely closed. In addition, when reading, the book could be held from outside the cover, so that the clean inside surface of the leather, rather than the thumbs of the reader, touched the pages. This stopped the pages acquiring the dirty patches in the lower margins that many medieval books have. These too are often shown in art, although it is noticeable that readers are often not making full use of the protective way of holding the book.
The knot used for the handle was a [[Turk's head knot]], so named for similar appearance to the turbans worn by medieval Muslims of the Turkish Empire. Sometimes the girdle book had a hook that fastened to the belt; "a hinge connected the hook to the flap of the binding, allowing maximal movement of the book while it was still attached."

Many girdle books were unadorned; however, there are also many that have brass corner pieces, carvings, awl punctures, artisan clasps, and possibly a family crest or other mark on the front. Given the security afforded by carrying the book around, it was less risky to add decoration and gilding to a book less easily stolen than a shelved manuscript. Additionally, ornate metal clasps and hinges were more durable than woven leather or cloth bindings that wore out more quickly from heavy use.

== Variations ==
Although not strictly girdle books, several other types of portable books were in use during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some larger books had rings attached to the standard binding so a cord could be slipped through them and wrapped around the waist. Other books were small enough that they could be worn around the neck. A small chain looped through a ring or two at the top of the binding was all that was necessary to make it portable. Finally, a fourth type of portable book was the ''[[vade mecum]]'' (go with me), consisting of a booklet or folded sheets that contained an [[almanac]] or medical information and could be suspended from a belt. The text on a vade mecum would be arranged in such a way as to be legible as someone unfolded the parchment, rather than having to constantly reorient the sheets.&lt;ref&gt;''Manuscript Studies'' Pg56.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The Medieval Girdle Book Project: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Containers and protective enclosures for books have been in use since long before the Middle Ages; the clay pots housing the Dead Sea Scrolls come to mind as do the leather cylinders used to store scrolls and clay tablets in the library at Alexandria and others, and the [[Cumdach|cumbdachs]] used by Irish monks to carry their precious manuscripts and prayer books from place to place, possibly even to Iceland, which they reached as early as 700 AD.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Lack of literature ==
Despite their significant representation in art depicting medieval clergy, there is a scarcity of literature outside of small communities seeking to recreate them. A wide variety of craft books cover the creation of modern girdle books.&lt;ref&gt;Diehn, Gwen. ''Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist &amp; Turn: Books for Kids to Make.'' Lark Books. New York. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Many amateur historians have created more technical overviews of "historically accurate" girdle books.&lt;ref&gt;Lady Gwerfyl verch Aneirin. "Late-Fifteenth-Century Girdle Book (Overcover and Cord Closure). www.aneira.org. Accessed 04/46/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, being such a specialized technique, the girdle book lacks the attention given to more popular medieval binding methods in the enthusiast community

Notable exceptions are the [http://www.artesdellibro.com/pdf/medievalgirdlebook.pdf Girdle Book Project], a collaboration between Margit Smith of the University of San Diego and Jim Bloxam of Cambridge University Library and Smith's monograph. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Margit J. ''The medieval girdle book.'' New Castle, Delaware: Oak Knoll Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to "[bring] the girdle book to the attention of professionals working with books as librarians, curators, teachers, book dealers and collectors, and hand [[bookbinding|bookbinders]], may increase appreciation of a book format, which, though small in size, has some importance, but is now almost forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Margit Smith and Jim Bloxam. "The Medieval Girdle Book Project" V3.N4. ''International Journal of the Book'' Melbourne, Australia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, many more books were bound not as girdle books but as similarly protected chemise covered books. Chemise covered books were often larger and designed for comfortable, stationary reading.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Huichol art''' broadly groups the most traditional and most recent innovations in the [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|folk art and handcrafts]] produced by the [[Huichol people]], who live in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[Nayarit]] in Mexico.  The unifying factor of the work is the colorful decoration using symbols and designs which date back centuries. The most common and commercially successful products are "yarn paintings" and objects decorated with small commercially produced beads. Yarn paintings consist of commercial yarn pressed into boards coated with wax and resin and are derived from a ceremonial tablet called a neirika. The Huichol have a long history of beading, making the beads from clay, shells, corals, seeds and more and using them to make jewelry and to decorate bowls and other items. The "modern" beadwork usually consists of masks and wood sculptures covered in small, brightly colored commercial beads fastened with wax and resin.

While the materials have changed and the purpose of many of the items have changed from religious to commercial purposes, the designs have changed little, and many retain their religious and symbolic significance. Most outsiders experience Huichol art as tourists in areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]], without knowing anything about the people who make the items, and the meanings of the designs. There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.

==The Huichol People==
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|175px|Huichol woman and child]]
The [[Huichol people|Huichols]] are an indigenous people who mostly live in the mountainous areas of northern Jalisco and parts of Nayarit in north central Mexico, with the towns of San Andrés, Santa Catarina and San Sebastián as major cultural centers. Their numbers are estimated at 50,000 and the name Huichol is derived from the word Wirriarika, which means soothsayer or medicine man in the [[Huichol language]].&lt;ref name="survival2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3165-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-two.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival II: authenticity and commercialization |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uribe |first=Carlos Rios  |date=September–October 1996 |title= In the track of the deer |journal=Art Education |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish]] arrived in the 16th century, the Huichols retreated into the rugged mountains of northern Jalisco and Nayarit. While nominally converted to Christianity in the colonial period by Franciscan missionaries, most of the native Huichol culture managed to survive intact due to the isolation, and because the area lacked mineral or other resources of interest to the Spanish.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dkarla"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Primosch |first=karla  |author2=Kathy David |date=November 2001 |title= Art of the Huichol people: A symbolic link to an ancient culture |journal=Art Education |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=25–32  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican historian and anthropologist [[Fernando Benítez]] states that the Huichols have probably maintained their ancient belief systems better than any other indigenous group in Mexico.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Much of this isolationist tendency remains intact although economic circumstances have forced a number of Huichols to migrate to areas such as Guadalajara, and coastal areas to work or sell their wares.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;

The religious faith of the Huichols is still based on a "trinity" of veneration of the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The last is ritually gathered each year on a long pilgrimage to the desert area of [[San Luis Potosí]], where the people are said to have originated and used by [[shaman]]s.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The importance of this and the pantheon of gods is seen in their stylistic representations on just about everything that the Huichol decorate. They did not have a written language until recently, so these symbols were and are the primary form of preserving the ceremonies, myths and beliefs of ancient Huichol religion.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

==Yarn painting and beadwork==
[[File:StringArt1MAPDF.JPG|thumb|Yarn painting at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
[[File:MaskWomanTep.JPG|thumb|Beaded mask on sale in Tepotzotlán, State of Mexico]]
The best known Huichol art is made with modern, commercially produced items such as yarn and small beads. The [[Tepehuán]]es of [[Durango]] adapted the yarn paintings. These have replaced many of the traditional materials such as clay, stone and vegetable dyes.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Making and decorating items with beads did not begin with importation of European glass beads, as it did with a number of indigenous cultures to the far north.  Techniques for making and using beads have been in place long before that with beads made from bone, clay, stone, coral, [[turquoise]], [[pyrite]], [[jade]] and seeds.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Huichol art was first documented in the very late 19th century by [[Carl Lumholtz]]. This includes the making of beaded earrings, necklaces, anklets and more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

What mostly links the yarn paintings and beaded objects made today is the continuance of the traditional patterns used for centuries to represent and communicate with the gods.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The use of commercial materials has allowed for the production of more elaborate designs and brighter colors, as well as more flexibility in how traditional concepts are rendered.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  It has also allowed that the production of commercialized folk art along with the production of strictly religious items.&lt;ref name="4survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3441-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-four |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival IV: an art in evolution |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date= May 18, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commercialization of Huichol art began when a [[Franciscan order|Franciscan]] priest by the name of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists exhibited here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work came to the attention of American [[Peter Furst]], who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered baseboard.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3262.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival I: Origins |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from "nierikas" a small board or disc with a hole or mirror in the center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming peyote, then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

These modern yarn paintings quickly proved popular and were imitated. They have also developed into complex designs which can take weeks to complete.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The yarn paintings led to experimentation with other commercially produced materials such as beads, which have taken the place of yarn for many Huichol artisans. This beading has been expanded to include the decoration of jaguar heads, masks of the sun and moon and various animal forms.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

This art produced for commercial purposes has provided an important, sustainable source of income for the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the "authenticity" of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the "authenticity" of the modern works has to do with the continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the [[jaguar]] (a [[Mesoamerica]]n symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs.&lt;ref name="4survival"/&gt; Selling of the items has not been easy for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and [[San Miguel de Allende]] as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe)

==Noted Huichol artists==
[[File:InsideMuseoHuicholZapopan.JPG|thumb|Inside the Huichol museum in the Basilica of Zapopan, Jalisco]]
Notable Huichol artists include Emeteria Ríos Martínez, who has done a number of yarn painting murals.&lt;ref name="banderas"&gt;{{cite news |title= Institute of the Americas Hosts Huichol Art Exhibit |url= http://www.banderasnews.com/1002/art-ioahuicholexhibit.htm |newspaper=Banderas News |location=Puerta Vallarta |date=February 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; José Benítez Sánchez is a shaman-artist, who helped to expand yarn painting from its early decorative function to larger more vision like pieces.&lt;ref name="dmarsden"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsden |first=Dawn |date=Winter 2005 |title=Visions of a Huichol Shaman |journal=American Indian Quarterly |volume=29 |issue=1/2 |pages=302–304 |doi=10.1353/aiq.2005.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Taizan is also a shaman in the village of Mesa de Tirador. He principally does beadwork featuring animal figures used in healing.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; [[Santos de la Torre]] made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal at the Louvre, Paris.&lt;ref name="palais-royal"&gt;{{cite web|title=palais-royal
|url=http://metro-paris.fr/en/#/place/palais-royal-musee-du-louvre-station}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Mexican portrait documentary '[[Echo of the Mountain]]', originally known in Spanish as Eco de la montaña&lt;ref name="echoofthemountain"&gt;{{cite web|title=echoofthemountain|url=http://echoofthemountain.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Nicolás Echevarría]] released based on his experiences during the mural creation.

==More traditional items==
Although the yarn paintings and items decorated with beads are the best known and most widely sold pieces, the Huichols continue to make a number of other types of folk art and handcrafts. Urus, or prayer arrows, are ceremonial arrows created to be shot into the air and petition the gods for special blessings. They are also sometimes left at certain places or sent down rivers. These arrows are decorated with symbols and designs related to the petition.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

From the far past to the present, men, women and children all wear woven bags around their waist to carry personal objects. These bags are colored and otherwise decorated for aesthetic and to magically protect the wearer.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

A "kuka" is a three dimensional ceremonial mask which is decorated by beading. These masks evolved from small gourd bowls originally covered in seeds, bone, clay, coral and shell, but these have been replaced by commercially produced beads. It is from these masks that the modern practice of covering wooden sculptures of snakes, dolls, small animals, jaguar heads and other forms is derived.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Nearika are highly decorated ceremonial objects that can be circular or diamond-shaped. When [[Carl Lumholtz]] did his writing on the Huichol, he named the circular ones "frontal shields" and the diamond-shaped ones as "eyes" and giving rise to the concept of the "[[God's eye]]s," applied to a Huichol cross. Nearika are tablets of wood or [[bamboo]] which are heavily decorated placed into certain sacred areas. Often they focus on a face of a sun, moon or person. From these the new tradition of yarn paintings developed, and the most traditional of these still show the round face of Tau, the Sun, in the middle.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

Most outsiders are not aware that most Huichol patterns and designs have religious and cultural significance.&lt;ref name="haviland"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William A. |last2=Prins |first2=Harald E.L. |author3=Dana Walrath |title= Cultural anthropology: the human challenge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxzZl460258C&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=huichol+beadwork&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sVrbjLdThf&amp;sig=HhyOSsckK4_cv-qTBz9dh5wtacA&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ei=nZ37TYKLNouftwePydi6Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTiYAg#v=onepage&amp;q=huichol%20beadwork&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |year=2005 |publisher= Cengage Learning |page=331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns can be found on a wide variety of objects including carved and beaded on masks, gourds, musical instruments and embroidered on clothing objects such as belts, sashes, side bags, and  more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Most have religious significance and many are influenced by visions which occur during peyote rituals.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haviland"/&gt;  Much of what is known about Huichol designs and symbols was put together by Norwegian explorer and ethnographer Carl Lumholtz in the late 19th century, but Huichol art and decoration has since become more varied.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; However, plant and animal motifs remain the most common and most retain their original meaning.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

When ceremonial or religious items are made, all aspects of the making from materials to colors to designs are important as they are identified with particular gods and meanings. [[Mesquite]] and the color reddish brown belong to Tatewari, who is of the earth and the wood of the Brazil tree is related to Tayuapa or "Father Sun." Symbols such as the [[golden eagle]] and [[macaw]]s are related to Tatewari. Shapes such as the deer, [[coyote]], pine tree or whirlwind can be associated with Tamat’s Kauyumari, who shaped the world. The salate tree, the [[armadillo]] and the bear are associated with Takutzi Nakahue, the mother of all gods and of corn.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; The toto is a small white flower with five petals associated with the rainy season. Sashes and belts often have designs that mimic the markings on the backs of snakes, which are also associated with rain, along with good crops, health and long life.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The zigzag lines that emanate from all living things represent communication with the deities.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt; The butterfly motif is reminiscent of the Itzpapolotl or Obsidian Butterfly, a principal deity of the classical [[Aztec]]s.

The most common motifs are related to the three most important elements in Huichol religion, the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The first two are important as primary sources of food, and the last is valued for its hallucinogenic properties which give shamans visions.&lt;ref name="3survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3280-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-three |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival III: motifs and symbolism |author=Ronald A.

==Exhibitions of Huichol art==
Most outsiders’ experience with Huichol artwork comes from visiting areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]] and seeing the work being sold. However, most do not know what it is. These vendors are mostly Huichol women who come into these cities from rural villages.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The artwork varies greatly in size, with some as large as murals. In 2010, the Institute of the Americas at the [[University of California, San Diego]], held an exhibit of Huichol art targeting tourists who visit the west coast of Mexico, especially those who travel by boat.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] in [[Mexico City]] held a temporary exhibit in 2009 comparing the art of the Huichol people with that of the aborigines of northern Australia entitled "Magica huichol: rito aborigen" ("Huichol Magic: Aborigine Ritual").  The aim was not to show any historical connection but rather to show the similarity of style between two disparate cultures.&lt;ref name="tmargolis"&gt;{{cite news |title= Huichol and aboriginal art: Two indigenous visions |first=Therese |last=Margolis |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News |location=Washington, DC |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bead Museum]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]], held an exhibit called "The HuicholWeb of Life: Creation and Prayer".&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Huichol work has been commissioned for public display.  There is a permanent display of twelve Huichol murals at the [[San Diego International Airport|Lindbergh International Airport]] at Terminal 3.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt; A Huichol bead mural was commissioned for the [[Paris Métro]] at the [[Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro)|Palais Royal-Musee de Louvre station]]. It was donated by the [[Mexico City Metro]] to France, as a returned favor for the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Metro Bellas Artes|Bellas Artes station]] entrance which was donated by France to Mexico. The work is called "Huichol Thought and Soul" and measures 2.4 by 3 meters in total divided into 80 panels of 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm, created by artist [[Santos de la Torre]].&lt;ref name="donaran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Donaran a Paris un mural huichol |author=Dora Luz Haw |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 19, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Donating to Paris a Huichol mural }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent commissioned works is the "[[Vochol]]," a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] which was covered in Huichol designs using 2,277,000 beads fastened to the body of the car using a special heat-resistant resin. The car was commissioned by the Association of Friends of the Museo de Arte Popular and other public and private enterprises to be auctioned off to benefit Mexican artisans.&lt;ref name="mensaje"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=10228  |title= El Vochol, un vehículo para llevar el mensaje del pensamiento y la filosofía del pueblo huichol |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Vochol, a vehicle to carry the message of the thought and philosophy of the Huichol people |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inauguran"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inauguran el Vochol, auto intervenido por huicholes a base de chaquira |author= |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906002448/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inaugurate the Vochol, auto modified by Huichols with beads }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Humours of an Election''''' is a series of four [[oil painting]]s and later [[engraving]]s by [[William Hogarth]] that illustrate [[British general election, 1754 (Oxfordshire)|the election]] of a [[Parliament of Great Britain|member of parliament]] in [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Oxfordshire|Oxfordshire]] in 1754. The oil paintings were created in 1755. 
The first three paintings, ''An Election Entertainment'', ''[[Canvassing]] for Votes'' and ''The Polling'', demonstrate the [[Political corruption|corruption]] endemic in [[Unreformed House of Commons|parliamentary]] [[United Kingdom general elections|elections]] in the 18th century, before the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]]. The last painting, ''Chairing the Member'', shows the celebrations of the victorious [[Tory]] candidates and their supporters.

At this time each [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] elected two MPs, and there was a [[Suffrage#Social class|property qualification]] for voters, so only a minority of the male population was enfranchised. There was no [[secret ballot]], so bribery and intimidation were rife. However, this traditional view has been questioned by recent historians who observed lively local political participation in this time.

The originals are held by [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London.

==''An Election Entertainment''==
[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|thumb|350px|''An Election Entertainment'' from ''The Humours of an Election'' series, 1755]]
The painting depicts a tavern dinner organised by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] candidates, while the [[Tory|Tories]] protest outside. The Tories are carrying an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] caricature of a Jew, a reference to [[Jewish Naturalization Act 1753|recent legislation passed]] by the [[Henry Pelham|Whig government]] which allowed greater freedom [[History of the Jews in England|to Jews]]. A banner containing the words "[[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|Give us our Eleven days]]", a protest against the [[Calendar reform#Julian/Gregorian reforms|adoption]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]], which was carried by the Tories, is on the tavern floor. 

In the tavern the two Whig candidates are ingratiating themselves with supporters. One candidate is kissing an ugly pregnant woman; the other is listening to a drunken bore. At the other end of the table the Mayor is collapsing from over indulgence in oysters, while the Election Agent is knocked out by a brick thrown through the window by the Tory mob. Other supporters throw furniture at the Tories.

[[Sir John Parnell, 1st Baronet]] is seen seated below the window, using his hand and a napkin as a puppet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.princeton.edu/~graphicarts/2010/09/four_prints_of_an_election_175.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the scene parodies traditional images of the [[Last Supper]] and other Biblical feasts.

==''Canvassing for Votes''==
[[Image:William Hogarth 032.jpg|thumb|350px|''Canvassing for Votes'' from ''The Humours of an Election'' series, 1755]]
This scene depicts Tory and Whig agents, both attempting to bribe an innkeeper to vote for them. The crowd outside the tavern is visible in the background. In a reference to the antisemitism of the crowd behind, a Jewish peddler is being employed by another agent who is offering jewels and ribbons to the wives of voters. 

On the margins of the composition a soldier (left) and two old sailors (right) represent uncorrupted patriotism. The soldier peeps out from behind a now-impotently decorative figurehead depicting the [[Lion (heraldry)|British lion]] devouring the French [[fleur-de-lis]]. A woman sits on it looking at her bribes. The sailors on the right are re-enacting a naval victory using pieces of broken clay pipe.

==''The Polling''==
[[Image:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Polling'' from ''The Humours of an Election'' series, 1755]]
Voters are shown declaring their support for the Whigs (orange) or Tories (blue). Agents from both sides are using unscrupulous tactics to increase their votes or challenge opposing voters. A Whig voter with a hook instead of his amputated hand is being challenged because he is placing his hook, rather than his hand, as legally prescribed, on the book. 

Meanwhile, the Tories are bringing a mentally disabled man to vote. A dying man is being carried in behind him. In the background a woman in a carriage with a broken axle stands for [[Britannia]]. Her coachmen are gambling, ignoring the fact that the carriage is broken.

==''Chairing the Member''==
[[Image:William Hogarth 029.jpg|thumb|350px|''Chairing the Member'', from ''The Humours of an Election'' series, 1755]]
One of the victorious Tory candidates is being carried through the streets on a chair in a traditional ceremony. He is about to tumble down because one of his carriers has just been accidentally hit on the head by a flail carried by a Tory-supporting rural labourer who is attempting to fight off a Whig supporter (an old sailor with a bear). 

A group of frightened pigs run across the scene in a reference to the story of the [[Legion (demon)|gadarene swine]]. The Whig leaders watch from a nearby house. At the right two young [[chimney sweep]]s urinate on the bear.

The '''Image Universe''' is a [[fictional universe|fictional]] [[shared universe]] wherein many of the [[comic book]]s published by [[Image Comics]] take place.

== Publication history ==
The Image Universe began with the founding of Image Comics in 1992, launching with series such as ''[[The Savage Dragon]]'', ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]''.

Image Comics' nature of allowing comic creators to retain the rights to the characters they publish with Image had led to many characters entering or exiting the Image Universe as the creators move from or to other publishers. Image co-founder and ''Savage Dragon'' creator Erik Larsen generally treats the Image Universe continuity as though each title exists in its own universe, and any crossovers between different creators' characters are events that occur simultaneously in each respective characters' universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=15081 |title=One Fan's Opinion: Issue #14 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jim Lee was an Image partner, his [[WildStorm]] properties such as ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]'', ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Gen¹³]]'', ''[[Union (comics)|Union]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'', ''[[Wetworks]]'', and ''[[Backlash (comics)|Backlash]]'' regularly crossed over with other Image characters, but when he sold his studio to [[DC Comics]], this ceased, and the WildStorm characters have since been incorporated into the post-"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" [[DC Universe]]. Most of the comic characters in the Image Universe however are originally individually creator-owned from when the company was established.

There were several Image crossover mini-series in the 1990s, such as ''Shattered Image'', ''Altered Image'' and ''Splitting Image'', along with the Eclipse Comics satire ''Spittin' Image'', but only ''[[Mars Attacks]] Image'' had any direct impact on the titles represented, as the Martians' attack was also shown and referenced many times in the ''Savage Dragon'' series.

In 2009, the Image Universe had its first major crossover in several years with ''[[Image United]]''.

[[Image:KateSantley001.jpg|right|frame|Santley, c. 1875]]
'''Evangeline Estelle Gazina''' (c.1837&lt;ref name=Culme&gt;Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20040821home.html Kate Santley], ''Footlight Notes'', No. 361, 14 August 2004, accessed 7 September 2012; and [http://www.remainstobeseen.com/item.php?item_no=2431 "Kate Santley by Sarony Cabinet Card"], ''Remains to Be Seen'', accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; – 18 January 1923), better known under her stage name, '''Kate Santley''', was a German-born actress, singer and comedian.  After spending her childhood in the US, she came to England in 1861, where she had a successful career, later also becoming a theatre manager.

==Early life==
Santley's parents emigrated from Germany to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she was educated. At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, she came to England as a practising musician, but soon afterwards went on the stage as "Eva Stella", later becoming "Kate Santley".&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Kate Santley. Memories of Opera Bouffe and Burlesque", ''[[The Times]]'', 19 January 1933, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical theatre career==
Santley made a name in the 1860s in British [[music hall]]s and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] [[pantomime]]s.  Early in her career, she was popular for singing the song "The Bell goes a-ringing for Sarah."  At the [[Oxford Music Hall]], she had appeared with [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], who later married [[Carl Rosa]].  Santley was slim and pretty and became much photographed for visiting cards, postcards and advertising.  Early in her career, she played in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''St. George and the Dragon''.

[[Image:Kate Santley as Princess Toto.jpg|left|frame|as ''[[Princess Toto]]'']]
In 1871–72, she visited the US, where she appeared on Broadway, including in a revival of the hit 1866 musical, ''[[The Black Crook]]''.  Returning to London in 1872, she appeared in the London production of ''The Black Crook'' at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], where, the next year, she also starred in the title role in Burnand's English version of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Belle Hélène]]''.  Later in 1873, she sang Cunegonde in ''Le roi Carotte''.  In 1874, she played Haidee in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Don Juan'', then in ''La Jolie Parfumeuse'', followed by the title role in ''[[Whittington (opera)|Whittington]]'', by Offenbach.&lt;ref&gt;Perdoni, Leon A. [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Alhambra/Prog3.htm "An Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square Programme for 1873"]. Arthur Lloyd, 2005, accessed 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, she played Wilhelmina in ''The Jolly Waterman'' at the [[Opera Comique]] and then created the title character in (and produced) ''[[Princess Toto]]'', a [[comic opera]] by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay]].  Thereafter, Clay wrote numerous songs (such as her popular hit, "Nobody knows as I know") and other operas for Santley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossmith|first=George|year=1888|title=A Society Clown: Reminiscences|location=Bristol/London|publisher=Arrowsmith}} Chapter 8 [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/grossmith/gg08.html Available online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Santley produced and starred in ''Dipunacy'', which was a popular [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''Diplomacy''.  1879, at the [[Royalty Theatre]], Santley played in ''La Marjolaine'' and starred in (and produced) ''Little Cinderella'' and in the hit ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'' by [[Frank Desprez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021130.html "Kate Santley and Company at the Royalty Theatre" (review of ''Tita'')]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, she played in the Drury Lane pantomime ''Mother Goose (and the Enchanted Beauty)'' with [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]], the popular music hall comedian.  In 1884, Santley played in ''La Cosaque'' at the Royalty, and in 1886, she hired [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] as musical director for the tour of her musical ''Vetah''.  In 1887, she played the title role in ''Indiana'' at the Grand Theatre, [[Islington]], and then on tour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RA4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 "The Only Jones"], ''Judy, or the London Serio-comic Journal'', Volume 41, 5 October 1887, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre management==
[[File:Indiana - Weir Collection.jpg|thumb|Santley in ''Indiana'' at [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]], Edinburgh]]
In 1876, Santley managed [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s revival of their one-act hit ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]].  [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] joined forces with Santley in January 1877 at the Royalty to present ''Lischen and Fritzen'', Offenbach's ''Orpheus in the Underworld'' and ''Happy Hampstead'' by Carte (under the pseudonym Mark Lynne) and his secretary, [[Frank Desprez]].
In 1877, Santley became the manager of the Royalty Theatre, an association lasting some thirty years.  She later seems to have acquired the head lease.&lt;ref name=british-history&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street – The Royalty Theatre''] ''[[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho'' (1966), pp. 215–21 (British History Online), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, the First Chief Officer of the [[London Fire Brigade]] strongly recommended to the Metropolitan Board of Works the immediate closure of the theatre.  Santley, however, had it reconstructed to designs of architect Thomas Verity, whose plans, providing improved means of egress, were approved in 1882.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

Many of the productions at the Royalty were opera-bouffes adapted from the French.  M. L. Mayer, formerly of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the [[Comédie-Française]] appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognised home of the Parisian drama.'  There was further reconstruction of the theatre in 1883, and Santley was praised for the theatre's renovations then and in the later 1905 renovation.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; The opening of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and of new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Apollo Theatre]], drew audiences away from the little Royalty theatre in Dean Street, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.  This led to her providing an occasional home for the [[Independent Theatre Society]], who produced plays on a subscription-only basis – hence evading the censorship of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The London première's of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (on 13 March 1891) and [[Émile Zola]]'s ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' (on 9 October 1891), led to a storm of protest, with some critics calling for the withdrawal of Santley's licence.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s first play, ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', premièred for the Society at the theatre on 9 December 1892.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt; When the theatre finally had a great success, with [[Brandon Thomas]]'s play, ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was [[Arthur Bourchier]], and the theatre underwent another renovation.  He produced, among other plays, ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights.  In 1899, the first production of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took place with the first performance of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''.  In 1900–01 [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre.  Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by [[W. B. Yeats]] and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of [[John Millington Synge|Synge]]'s first play, ''The Shadow of the Glen''.  In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.&lt;ref name=british-history/&gt;

==Personal==
Santley married Lieutenant Colonel Lockhart Mure Hartley Kennedy in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl?start=1901&amp;end=1901&amp;sq=4&amp;eq=4&amp;type=Marriages&amp;vol=5c&amp;pgno=1115&amp;db=bmd_1460362145&amp;jsexec=1&amp;mono=0&amp;v=MTQ2MTE0NDk1MDo0NzI2NWU4ZTI4NTk3MDdmMDI5YjljYmEyY2EwYzUxMzcwNTNmYzNl&amp;searchdef=db%3Dbmd_1460362145%26given%3DLockhart%26type%3DMarriages%26surname%3DKennedy%26sq%3D1%26eq%3D4&amp;action=Find "Evangeline Estella G. Von Heidt and Lockhart Alure (sic) H. Kennedy married"], Free BMD, December quarter, 1901, accessed 20 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to read her own obituaries when premature news of her death circulated in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 January 1923&lt;/ref&gt; She died at her home in Brunswick Square, [[Brighton]], in 1923.  She claimed that she was born in 1843, but like many actresses, her actual birthday was likely earlier, and some sources date her birth to 1837.&lt;ref name=Culme/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre''' is a region in the city of [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is not the "historic center" of the city as this lies to the south around [[Masmak]] fort and the main Friday Mosque" in the Dira district. The origin of the ''King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre'' is the former compound of [[Murabba Palace|the Murabba' Palace]], that was built in 1936/37 by [[Ibn Saud|King Abdul Aziz]] about one and a half kilometers to the north of the old city and well outside of the then still existing city walls. 

After 1953 the palace compound ceased to be used as main royal residence and slowly fell into dissuse. The "Murabba' Development Project" was later started to make use of the area for projects involved with the ''Centennial Celebrations'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=9686 Project] listed at Archnet.&lt;/ref&gt; As such the area was chosen to be the site of several cultural institutions focusing on the national history in general and the history of the current Saudi State and its founder in detail. Consequently what had remained of the old palace compound buildings was restored or remodeled on plans similar to the original buildings. The surrounding area was made into a landscape of parks and plazas and new buildings were built such as the [[National Museum of Saudi Arabia]].

The units on the west side of the area are from south to north: A remodeled mosque, the old original Murabba' Palace with main Diwan renovated as "living museum", the "Memorial Hall" on the outlines of an old courtyard house, a modern exhibition hall for the car collection, on the footprints of the old majlis and assembly hall the new Al-Dara main lobby and multipurpose hall, a documentation center with a separated men's and women's library each, an art gallery and a large internal garden. On the east side the new ''National Museum of Saudi Arabia'' was built together with the [[King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives]]. To the south the area around the old water tower has been remodelled and now includes a small theme park. The whole project is said to have cost some 680 million Saudi riyals (about 181.33 million U.S. dollars at the time)&lt;ref&gt;''Saudi Arabia Celebrates the Centennial of a Historic Event'' in the [http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagWinter99/centennial.htm Saudi Arabia Magazine Winter 1999, Volume 15, Number 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and covers an area of some 360,000 square meters (3,000,000 sq ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/saudi.arabia.s.centennial.the.centennial.s.jewel.riyadh.htm ''Saudi Arabia’s Centennial: The Centennial’s Jewel—Riyadh''] by Arthur Clark in [[Saudi Aramco World]], issue 1 from 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7541">[[File:Apollo 11 plaque closeup on Moon.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Apollo 11]] plaque on the Moon bears the signatures of [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], and [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]]]]

The '''Lunar plaques''' are stainless steel [[commemorative plaque]]s measuring {{convert|9|by|7+5/8|in|cm|sigfig=3}} attached to the ladders on the descent stages of the United States [[Apollo Lunar Module]]s flown on lunar landing missions Apollo 11 through Apollo 17, to be left permanently on the lunar surface.  The plaques were originally suggested and designed by NASA's head of technical services [[Jack Kinzler]], who oversaw their production.&lt;ref name="Moon Flag"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Sandra L.|title=Red, White &amp; Blue: U.S. Flag at Home on the Moon|journal=Houston History Magazine|date=Fall 2008|volume=6|issue=1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

All of the plaques bear facsimiles of the participating astronauts' signatures. For this reason, an extra plaque had to be made for [[Apollo 13]] due to the late replacement of one crew member. The first ([[Apollo 11]]) and last ([[Apollo 17]]) plaques bear a facsimile of the signature of [[Richard Nixon]], [[President of the United States]] during the landings, along with references to the start and completion of "man's first explorations of the Moon" and expressions of peace "for all mankind".  

All, except the [[Apollo 12]] plaque (which is also textured differently), bear pictures of the two hemispheres of Earth. Apollo 17's plaque bears a depiction of the lunar globe in addition to the Earth. The plaques used on missions 13 through 16 bear the call-sign of each mission's Lunar Module. All the plaques were left on the Moon, except the two for the aborted Apollo 13 mission which did not land on the Moon.

*[[Apollo 11]] plaque inscription: ''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 [[Anno Domini|A.D]]. We came in peace for all mankind'' in capital letters. The statement "We came in peace for all mankind" is derived from the 1958 [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]]'s "declaration of policy and purpose":
::The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;

==Notes==
* The plaques are curved so as to fit around the landing leg and not hinder the astronauts from using the ladder.  The plaques were attached directly to the ladder rungs, between the third and fourth rungs from the bottom.
* Two plaques were made for Apollo 13, because of the replacement of Command Module Pilot [[Thomas Mattingly|Thomas K. "Ken" Mattingly]] with [[John Swigert|John L. "Jack" Swigert]] two days before launch. Mission Commander [[Jim Lovell|James "Jim" Lovell]] was to have placed the plaque bearing Swigert's name over the original already fastened to the LM ''Aquarius'', when he descended the ladder to walk on the Moon. When the landing was aborted, Lovell saved this plaque to keep as a memento, and it remains in his possession. The original plaque bearing Mattingly's name was destroyed when ''Aquarius'' reentered the Earth's atmosphere.
* The lunar near-side map, with the six Apollo lunar landing sites marked on it, was added to the Apollo 17 plaque at the suggestion of astronaut [[Gene Cernan]].
* Reproductions of the plaques were given as mementos to foreign governments through various United States embassies after each flight.
* [[James C. Humes]], a speech writer for President Nixon and four other presidents, is partly credited for authoring the text on the Apollo 11 lunar plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4190/is_20031017/ai_n10044844 |work=Colorado Springs Business Journal |date=Oct 17, 2003 |title=A candid interview with a presidential speechwriter |author=Marylou Doehrman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Safire]] and [[Pat Buchanan]] also worked on drafting the plaque.&lt;ref name="safire"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/opinion/of-nixon-kennedy-and-shooting-the-moon.html |title=Of Nixon, Kennedy and Shooting the Moon |author=William Safire |date=July 17, 1989 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of digital cameras may have made the use of bridal make up more popular.

==Makeup techniques==
; Fashion
Fashion makeup is used in magazine photography as well as on the fashion runway. [[Avant-garde]] makeup is also an applicable technique used for projects that require experimental themes. Fashion makeup is also commonly used in [[television]] and [[film]] ranging for the natural ''prime look'' to more sophisticated applications such as ''color balance''.
; Theatrical makeup
Stage makeup is used as a method in conjunction with stage lighting to highlight the actors' faces in order to make expressions visible to the audience from moderate distances.  This often includes defining the eyes and lips as well as the highlights and lowlights of the facial bones.
; Special make-up effects (FX makeup)
{{main|Prosthetic makeup}}
The use of special effects techniques enhancing physical features to exhibit {{clarify|text=[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] characteristics|date=January 2016}} as well as fantasy makeup. The use of prosthetics and plaster casting are also required for projects that entails non-human appearances. Accents such as [[theatrical blood]] and ooze are also techniques applicable to this type of makeup.
; Airbrushing
The use of an [[airbrush]] which is a small air-operated device that sprays various media some products and water-based makeup by a process of nebulization.  The earliest record of this type of cosmetic application dates back to the 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AIRBRUSH FOUNDATION MAKE-UP| url=http://www.airbrushbodyart.com.au/foundation_make-up.htm | work=Airbrush Body Art | accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; film version of Ben-Hur, it has recently been re-popularized by the advent of HDTV and digital photography, where the camera focuses on higher depths of detail. Liquid foundations that are high in coverage but thin in consistency are applied with the airbrush for full coverage without a heavy build-up of product.
; Bridal makeup
Bridal makeup is a new segment in a makeup artist's repertoire.  From ethnic, to glamorous, to contemporary, makeup artists are now an important part of wedding planning in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America.
; High definition
This is an art which involves the use of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Top High Definition Makeup | url=http://makeup.about.com/od/topsplurg8/tp/Top-High-Definition-Makeup.htm | work=Makeup.com| accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflectors and ingredients such as minerals to give the skin a flawless finish. This was developed due to the further development of [[HDTV|high definition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Makeup artists in Bollywood==
In 1955 the [[Bollywood]] group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Samyabrata Ray Goswami |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141111/jsp/frontpage/story_19024241.jsp#.VTaWKul0wdk |title=Women get makeup justice |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014 the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty).&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no "rationale nexus" to the cause sought to be achieved and was "unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amit Anand Choudhary|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bollywood/Bollywood-make-up-artists-group-inducts-first-woman-after-SC-rap/articleshow/46995208.cms |title=Bollywood make-up artists’ group inducts first woman after SC rap |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) authorised an official protest on the movie set of [[Bang Bang!]] in protest of a foreign makeup artist, Daniel Bauer working on the movie for its lead actress, [[Katrina Kaif]]. The CCMAA and 15 of its members protested on the movie set as Daniel Bauer was not registered with the Union, despite the Union banning foreign artists working in Bollywood. The issue was resolved with the CCMAA granting Daniel Bauer full membership &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/salman-khan-comes-to-katrina-kaif-s-rescue/story-GMCYL9HKR55xcJU3pXZB7O.html|title=Salman Khan comes to Katrina Kaif's rescue|author=|date=28 June 2014|website=hindustantimes.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Nature printing''' is a printing process, developed in the 18th century, that uses the plants, animals, rocks and other natural subjects to produce an image.  The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process.

[[Image:Nature print (Bradbury).jpg|thumb|Plate from ''The Nature-printed British Seaweeds'', (1859-60).]]

Another person attributed with the invention of the process, [[:de:Naturselbstdruck|''Naturselbstdruck'']], is [[Alois Auer]]; the first publication, of instructions for the process, was by this Austrian printer in ''The Discovery of the Natural Printing Process: an Invention ...''  Vienna, 1853. This was written in four languages by the author.  He shows the use of plants, a fossil fish, and lace impressed by roller onto a lead plate, this is hand coloured and transferred to the final print.  
[[Image:Nature print, Alois Auer.jpg|thumb|240px]]
Many others botanical and natural history illustrations had attempted to use techniques that were a 'shorthand', or for a type of accuracy, in the representation of subjects. Another printer, the Englishman [[Henry Bradbury]], immediately used Auer's 'nature printing' process to publish work of his own. These included two major botanical works; 
*''[[The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland]]'', [[Thomas Moore (botanist)|Moore, Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland; Edited by [[John Lindley]]. Nature-printed by Henry Bradbury. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;(1857) and the rendition of these species was readily adapted to the process; the two dimensional print would reveal form and detail for the identification of species.
*''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds'', W.G. Johnstone &amp; A. Croall. 1859-60.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, William Grosart &amp; Alexander Croall. ''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds: A History, accompanied by figures and dissections, of the algæ of the British Isles''. Four volumes. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1859-60. Text available on Google books [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yaTjgEACAAJ&amp;dq=nature+printed+british+sea+weeds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy9_TitsrKAhUH4D4KHTfFCl8Q6AEILzAD here].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherman Denton]] in his book ''As Nature Shows Them: Moths and Butterflies ...'' used the wings of the species he was describing by pressing them into the page itself. For this work he used over 50,000 insects.&lt;ref name=Dentonc1900&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denton|first1=Sherman Foote|title=As nature shows them : moths and butterflies of the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains : with over 400 photographic illustrations in the text and many transfers of species from life|page = vi|date=1900|publisher=J.B. Millet|location=Boston, U.S.A|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/45790#page/11/mode/1up|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auer method==
Auer's method can only be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, embroidery and lace, and a few animals. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes.  For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in copper by the [[electrotyping|electrotype]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Nature Printing|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">'''Neo-Dada''' was a movement with [[audio art|audio]], [[visual art|visual]] and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier [[Dada]] artwork. In the United States the term was popularized by [[Barbara Rose]] in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, [[Neo-Dada Organizers|particularly in Japan]] and in Europe, serving as the foundation of [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Nouveau réalisme]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada was exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and [[Absurdism|absurd]]ist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of [[Abstract Expressionism]] and, taking a lead from the practice of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]], denied traditional concepts of [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Craft, pp.10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''The Dada Painters and Poets'' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yzchnw4YUlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Brill, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Young, ''Dada and After: Extremist Modernism and English Literature'', Manchester University 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-RXpAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PT96&amp;dq=neo-dada&amp;pg=RA4-PT96#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-dada&amp;f=false pp.201–3] and Brill, pp.104–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, [[Piero Manzoni]]'s  ''Consacrazione dell'arte dell'uovo sodo'' (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist's personal creation and art as commodity. 

[[File:Basel Fasnachtsbrunnen Jean Tinguely.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A Jean Tingueley fountain in Basel]]
An allied approach is found in the creation of [[collage]] and [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], as in the junk sculptures of the American [[Richard Stankiewicz]], whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters' practice. These objects are "so treated that they become less discarded than found, ''objets trouvés''."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater in ''A Dictionary of Modern Sculpture'', London 1962, pp.277–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tinguely]]'s fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing ''Homage to New York'' (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical.

Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] labeled as "combines" such works as "Bed" (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. [[Arman]] labeled as "accumulations" his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as "''poubelles''" the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. [[Daniel Spoerri]] created "snare pictures" (''tableaux piège''), of which the earliest was "Kichka's Breakfast" (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.

==Poems==
In the Netherlands the poets associated with the 'magazine for texts', ''Barbarber'' (1958–71), particularly [[J. Bernlef]] and [[K. Schippers]], extended the concept of the [[readymade]] into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Mourits, ''The Conceptual Poetic of K. Schippers: the aesthetic implications of literary readymades'', Dutch Crossing 21.1, pp.119–34&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine ''Gard Sivik'' and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager (1935–92), [[Hans Verhagen]] and the artist [[Armando (artist)|Armando]]. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that "the poet's role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non-poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers."&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Brems, ''Contemporary Poetry of the Low Countries'', Flemish Netherlands Foundation, 1995, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914–94), the theorist of the [[Zero (art)|Dutch Nul group]] of artists, to which Armando also belonged: "Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero."&lt;ref&gt;Translation in ''Dutch Interior: Postwar Poetry of the Netherlands and Flanders'', Columbia University 1984, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cPOqoSriyY0C&amp;lpg=PR36&amp;ots=BobxbkKkkC&amp;dq=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;pg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;f=false pp.36–7]&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau Réaliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism.

The beginnings of [[Concrete Poetry]] and text montage in the [[Wiener Gruppe]] have also been referred back to the example of [[Raoul Hausmann]]'s letter poems.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Katharina Schaffner, "How the Letters Learned to Dance: on language dissection in Dadaist, Digital and Concrete Poetry", in  Avant-garde/Neo-avant-garde, Amsterdam 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CttwTdwx04C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.149–165]&lt;/ref&gt; Such techniques may also owe something to [[H.N. Werkman]]'s typographical experiments in the Netherlands which had first been put on display in the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1945.

[[File:On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae.djvu|page=5|thumb|right|Title page]]
'''''On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae''''' is an 1809 paper on the family [[Proteaceae]] of flowering plants. Although nominally written by [[Joseph Knight (gardener)|Joseph Knight]] as a paper on cultivation techniques, all but 13 pages consists of an unattributed taxonomic revision now known to have been written by [[Richard Salisbury]].

Publication of the paper triggered one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany, because Salisbury had preempted the publication of numerous plant names that [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] had intended to publish. Brown's paper had already been read to the [[Linnean Society of London]], at meeting which Salisbury had attended, but his paper had not yet made it to print. In publishing this paper before Brown's ''[[On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae]]'' had been printed, Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. As a result of this, Salisbury was accused of [[plagiarism]] and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, [[Samuel Goodenough]] wrote "How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!"; and [[James Edward Smith]] wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper "but shall not keep it — I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions." Brown himself wrote of Salisbury "I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool."

Initially, Salisbury's names were ignored in favour of Brown's names. When the [[nomen conservandum|conservation]] of generic names was introduced in the 1900s, Brown's genera were formally conserved. However it was not possible to conserve species names until the 1980s, by which time the priority of Salisbury's species names had long been accepted. Thus ''On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae'' is the source of numerous names of Proteaceae taxa.

'''Project Gutenberg Canada''', also known as '''Project Gutenburg of Canada''', is a Canadian digital library founded July 1, 2007. Their website allows Canadian residents to create e-texts and download books that are otherwise not in the [[public domain]] in other countries. 

It is not formally affiliated with the original [[Project Gutenberg]], though both share the common objective of making public domain books available for free to the general public as [[e-book]]s. Project Gutenburg Canada primarily focuses on works by Canadian authors or about Canada, as well as works in [[Canadian French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://gutenberg.ca/links/ourmission.html|website=Project Gutenberg Canada|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed Proofreaders Canada]] began contributing ebooks to Project Gutenberg Canada when launched on December 1, 2007.

==Canadian public domain==
{{see also|Copyright law of Canada}}
In Canada, [[Copyright law of Canada|the copyright period for works is 50 years after the year the author has died]]. Therefore, if the book was published during the author's lifetime and the author died 51 years ago or more, the book is in the Canadian public domain. Project Gutenberg Canada has received permission to redistribute books still under copyright in some cases.

Some authors whose works have entered the public domain in Canada and are thus available on Project Gutenberg Canada are [[A. A. Milne]], [[Walter de la Mare]], [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]], [[Amy Carmichael]], [[Gertrude Lawrence]], [[Marshall Broomhall]], [[Lilias Trotter]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Isobel Kuhn]], and [[George Orwell]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2242">[[File:Zakhrafa-kashani.JPG|thumb|Model of typical Qashani tile work consists of floral and geometrical patterns.]]
'''Qashani''' or '''Kashani''' is a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] decorative arts which had been popular in [[Iran]] in the 16th to 18th century, and then moved to [[Turkey]] in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] with the transfer of many Persians artists to Turkey, becoming the basis for decorating the walls of [[mosque]]s, palaces, shrines and tombs. It is a square-shaped ceramic tile which uses Persian-like floral-depicting 4- or 6-sided glazed tiles, decorated with blue, cyan, green and sometimes red colors. The decoration is surrounded by fine black lines that make it stand out on its white floor. The tile work had often been decorated by the inscription, floral and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical pattern]]s. The inscription often provides [[Qur'an]]ic verses or sentences related to historical events written in Persian script. The plant often consists of natural flowers such as lily, cloves, roses and cypress trees. Geometrical patterns consists of different geometrical shapes and polygons. In [[Morocco]], similar artistic technique is known as [[zellige|''zillij'']]. Its use has been widespread in the decoration of the walls of the buildings in the Ottoman era, and this mosaical feature can also be seen in the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Kashi, the abbreviated form of Qashani, was also introduced to [[Sindh]], [[Kutch]], and [[Multan]] where numerous examples of shrines and mosques embellished with blue, white and green tile work exist.&lt;ref&gt; Leadless Decorative Tiles, Faience, and Mosaic: 
William James Furnival - 1904 - This style of decoration is called Kashani, after Kashan in Persia, one of the chief seats of earthenware manufacture .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Runemarks''''' is a 2007 children's [[fantasy novel]] by [[Joanne Harris]]. The book was published on 2 August 2007 by Doubleday Publishing and is set in a world where the Norse gods still survive as outlaws, their powers diminished, while a new and more powerful religion, the Order, tries to wipe out magic from the world. Harris has stated that she was inspired to write the book due to her love of Norse mythology as a child, with the book being loosely based on a novel she wrote in her late teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=http://www.joanne-harris.co.uk/v3site/books/runemarks/index.html|publisher=Joanne Harris|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was followed up with a 2011 sequel entitled [[Runelight]].

== Description ==
''Runemarks'' follows Maddy, a young loner who has been ostracised from her town for the rust-coloured rune mark she carries on her left hand. Animals born with a rune mark on their bodies are seen as cursed or deformed and are usually quickly slaughtered. Maddy is allowed to live because she is human, but is always viewed with suspicion despite this. Her village does not follow the Norse Gods, as the puritanical regime known as the Order has mandated that no one is to speak or acknowledge any of the old ways, let alone use magic. It is only after she helps rid the local inn's cellar of goblins that Maddy discovers her latent magic, with it quickly becoming something that is occasionally useful to herself and those around her. As the book progresses Maddy flashes back to her childhood where she learned about runes and Norse legends through the old traveller One-Eye, who later reveals himself to Maddy as Odin and involves her in a quest to find a treasure buried beneath Red Horse Hill. As they search, they come across several other Norse gods and are led into a confrontation with the Order and their leader.

==Characters==
*'''Maddy Smith''': A troubled, defiant, lonely child who will not go to church and is described by others as "imaginative", which is thought almost as bad as "giving herself airs". Her father does not love her, believing her birth to have caused her mother's death. She is considered ugly, made worse by the fact that her sister is both popular and very pretty. She has no friends and seeks refuge in stories and things of the imagination, all of which are viewed as dangerous by the society in which she lives.
*'''Odin/One-Eye/the General''': A traveller who educates Maddy in the use of the runes, and eventually turns out to be the leader of the gods in disguise. He is wily, sometimes unscrupulous, occasionally manipulative. He befriends Maddy and helps her, but also plans to use her for his own ends. Weakened after the End of the Worlds, he has lost most of his powers, but still has ambitions to rebuild his empire.
*'''Loki, the Trickster''': Half-demon, half-god, escaped by devious means from the Fortress of Netherworld. Charming, dishonest and unscrupulous; a villain who ends up being a very reluctant hero.
*'''Skadi''': Huntress and goddess of hunting. Hates Loki.
*'''Freyja''': Goddess of Desire. Vain and shallow. Hates Loki.
*'''Heimdall''': watchman of the gods. Hates Loki most of all.
*'''Sugar-and-Sack''': A goblin and a reluctant hero, enlisted by Maddy.
*'''Adam Scattergood''': a boy in Maddy's village. A bully, the son of the local innkeeper and Maddy's principal tormentor.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Runemarks'' has been mostly positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article2307684.ece |title=Runemarks by Joanne Harris: Children's book of the week |accessdate=7 September 2008 |date=26 August 2007 |work=[[The Sunday Times]] | location=London | first=Nicolette | last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Runemarks|url=http://www.kidsreads.com/reviews/runemarks|publisher=KidsReads|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian praised the novel, stating it "has a narrative nonchalance which just about evens out its ponderous infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Runemarks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview30#article_continue|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 November 2012|location=London|first=Kathryn|last=Hughes|date=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SF Gate wrote that ''Runemarks'' "comes up short in terms of thematic rigor and depth of imagination" but that it also "delivers an adventure that will please a wide array of readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Risky trip through Norse myths in 'Runemarks'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Risky-trip-through-Norse-myths-in-Runemarks-3230842.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2 November 2012|first=Michael|last=Berry|date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ascension of Christ''''' (also known as '''''Sansepolcro Altarpiece'''''; Italian: ''Pala di Sansepolcro'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance master [[Perugino]], dating from around 1510. It is housed in the [[Cathedral of Sansepolcro]], [[Tuscany]], central [[Italy]].

==Description==
The works adopts the same composition in the central panel of Perugino's ''[[San Pietro Polyptych]]''. However, due to the greater sizes, he enhanced some decorative details, such as the ribbons held by the angels. The work also saw a massive collaboration of the artist's workshop.

Christ is portrayed within an almond hovering at the top center of the panel, surrounded by flying or playing angels, while the frame has heads of cherubims  and seraphims. The lower group includes Mary and the Apostles, with an [[Umbria]]n landscape in the background, characterized by slender trees.

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}
'''Scratch video''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[video art]] movement that emerged in the early to mid-1980s. It was characterised by the use of [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]], [[fast cutting]] and multi-layered rhythms. It is significant in that, as a form of [[outsider art]], it challenged many of the establishment assumptions of broadcast television - as well of those of gallery-bound video art.

Scratch Video arose in opposition to broadcast television, as (anti-)artists attempted to deal critically and directly with the impact of mass communications. The context these videos emerged in is important, as it tended to critique of the institutions making broadcast videos and the commercialism found on youth TV, especially [[MTV]]. This it did in form, content and in its mode of distribution.

Much of the work was politically radical, often containing images of a sexual or violent nature, and using images [[Appropriation art|appropriated]] from mainstream media, including corporate advertising; using strategies inspired by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] concept of [[detournement]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]’ theories of [[The Electronic Revolution|Electronic Revolution]].

The primary audience for scratch video in the early to mid-1980s, was in nightclub performances by industrial music bands such as [[The Anti-Group]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Nocturnal Emissions]], [[Psychic TV]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Test Dept]], and [[Autopsia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  Some of those involved described their work as a form of [[cultural terrorism]] or as a form of [[anti-art]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In the mid-1980s typical London venues would be screenings at artist-run spaces such as the Ambulance Station, in independent cinemas such as the Brixton [[Ritzy Cinema]], or [[the Fridge]] nightclub, which boasted an array of dozens of recycled colour televisions.  There was also significant distribution on [[VHS]] tape, following similar networks to [[cassette culture]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

After Andy Lipman’s [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] feature contextualised the art values of this practice, material began to be featured in small screenings in official art galleries such as the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] and [[Tate]].  Television stations, like [[Channel 4]] began late night screenings of art videos, including scratch video. However, because much of the material was constructed using domestic VHS equipment, it was deemed both technically and legally unsuitable for broadcast (for fear of breaching copyright law).  Being highly politicised, some of the material also broke with the broadcaster’s criteria of balance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==History==
''Scratch video'' is a rather catch-all category of work which derive from popular dance and music fashions and the cutting of found trash images with it. Its long history begins with the [[cubist]] collages of Picasso and Braque, the 'ready-mades' of [[Duchamp]], and passes through [[Joseph Cornell]], [[Bruce Conner]], [[Andy Warhol]] and William S. Burroughs and [[Anthony Balch]] [[cut-ups]]. The movement was influenced by the American video artist [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Mick Hartney, Grove Art Online, reproduced on the Museum of Modern Art website:[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215]&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of the movements emergence and how  it got its name, [[Rik Lander]] (one half of the [[Duvet Brothers]]) has stated: 

{{quote|I can’t remember when we found out what we were doing was scratch or that we were part of a movement. Certainly when we saw the work of [[Kim Flitcroft]] and Sandra Goldbacher, [[George Barber (artist)|George Barber]] and Gorilla Tapes it was uncanny that so many people had been experimenting in the same area without knowing that the others existed. In my mind a journalist called [[Pat Sweeney]] came up with the name Scratch, but Scratch Video may have already existed as a named form in the US. [[Andy Lipman]] ran a [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] cover story on Scratch Video in October 1984 where he tried to create the myth that Scratch was made by disaffected youth taping the [[TV]] and reediting it on [[VCRs]] at home. If anyone knew this was not the case it was Andy. He was one of the few people who had actually met all the people involved. [[Dessa Fox]] in the [[NME]] tried a similar hype when she suggested that Scratch Video was a televisual punk rock".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duvetbrothers.com/history.htm the duvet brothers - history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Original scratch video works continue to be shown in major exhibitions around the world. Notable events, amongst others, being Gorilla Tapes' participation in the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]]'s 2007 exhibition ''[https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/secret-public The Secret Public: The Last Days of the British Underground 1978-1988]'' and ''[http://www.seventeengallery.com/exhibitions/scratch/ SCRATCH!]'' a 2008 retrospective exhibition curated by [[Paul Pieroni]] at the Seventeen gallery in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Smoking concerts''' were live [[performance]]s, usually of [[music]], before an [[audience]] of men only, popular during the [[Victorian era]].  These social occasions were instrumental in introducing new musical forms to the public.  At these functions men would smoke and speak of politics while listening to live music.  These popular gatherings were sometimes held at hotels. The crews of HMS Curlew and HMS Hawkins attended a Smoker aboard USS Huron in Wei-hai-wei harbour, China, on 19 August 1921.

Although the concerts are now obsolete, the term continued and is used for student-organised variety performances, especially at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. Annual Smoking Concerts were held at [[Imperial College London]] into the 1980s and continue at [[Glasgow University Union]].

The saying "Booking for smoking concerts now" came into use at this time meaning that a person had recovered and was in the prime of health.  This saying is used in the works of writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Liverpool Medical Students Society]] at the [[University of Liverpool School of Medicine]] still hold an annual smoking concert, a tradition going back 130 years. Each of the five year groups present a play annually.[http://www.lmssonline.co.uk/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5228">The '''sociétaires of the [[Comédie-Française]]''' are chosen from among the ''pensionnaires'' who have been in the company a year or more.

They are decided upon in the course of a general assembly of the company's administrative committee, made up of 6 existing sociétaires, the senior sociétaire, and the general administrator.  A pensionnaire is thus named a societaire by a decree of the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]], from names put forward by the [[administrators of the Comédie-Française|general administrator]] of the Comédie-Française.  On becoming a sociétaire, an actor automatically becomes a member of the ''Société des Comédiens-Français'' and receives a share of the profits as well as receiving a number of shares in the société to which he or she is contractually linked.

After his or her retirement, a sociétaire can continue to act, becoming an honorary sociétaire.  The senior member of the Comédie-Française is not the oldest sociétaire, but the sociétaire who has been with the company longest (since their entering it as a pensionnaire).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14509">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Star Trek'' expanded universe}}
{{no footnotes|date=September 2015}}

The '''''Star Trek'' expanded universe''' is an unofficial, fan-created term to describe an extrapolation of events which occur in the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' Universe]] outside the scope of the television series and feature films.  Information from the ''Star Trek'' "Expanded Universe" typically fills "holes" in the ''Star Trek'' story and timeline, with explanations of events which have never been adequately explained through live action productions.  The term was first used in 1966 by writer D.C. Fontana to describe information put forth in the backstory of Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]].

Although original ''Star Trek'' fiction (for adult audiences) dates back to [[James Blish]]'s 1970 novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', published by [[Bantam Books]], the publishing company [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] is most directly responsible for contributing to the ''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe through its license with [[Pocket Books]] which has generated a large number of ''Star Trek'' novels over the past twenty-five years.  Information in the novels, while sometime contradictory, often serves to provide information to the ''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe.

The term "''Star Trek'' Expanded Universe" is not an official usage of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], or any other ''Star Trek'' licensee.  The term is occasionally used within fandom by analogy with the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] as defined by [[Lucasfilm]].  However, the policies and practices pertaining to licensed Star Trek fiction are not identical to those used by Lucasfilm.  For example, unlike in ''Star Wars'' fiction, there is no overall effort among the various licensees to integrate all ''Star Trek'' fiction into a single continuity.  Although the majority of ''Star Trek'' novels in recent years have been written to be consistent with one another and with certain ''Star Trek'' comic books, they remain incompatible with many earlier novels and comics, and occasionally with contemporary novels as well.

Many of these premises have been accepted by ''Star Trek'' fans as being [[canon (fiction)|canon]], even though [[Paramount Pictures]], owners of the ''Star Trek'' franchise, considers only live-action television and film productions to be canon.  This has led to conflict on occasion when a TV episode or film contradicts well-established Expanded Universe backstory (most notably in the case of the prequel series, ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

==Expanded premises==
* '''Leonard McCoy's Backstory''':  [[Leonard McCoy]] was married shortly before obtaining his medical degree.  Starting a private practice, McCoy fathered a daughter before being divorced by his wife and losing custody of his child.  Sometime after 2260, he closed his medical practice and accepted a staff officer's commission in [[Starfleet]] to escape the pain of losing his wife and daughter.
* '''Second Five Year Voyage of the USS ''Enterprise''''':  Following the events of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' the ''Enterprise'' embarked on a second five-year mission of exploration.  [[James T. Kirk]] did not regain his rank of [[rear admiral]] but chose to remain a [[captain]] to command the ''Enterprise''.  The aborted television series ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' was to have been set during this second five-year mission, and there remains a "gap" between the first and second ''Trek'' feature films that suggests such a mission ''might'' have occurred, though this has never been confirmed in any canonical resource.  It should be noted that stories that are set in this timeframe do not necessarily conform to any known episode storyline that was planned for ''Phase II''.
* '''Chekov's Promotion History and Later Life''':  [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] Chekov was promoted to [[lieutenant junior grade]] at the conclusion of the first five-year voyage of the ''Enterprise''.  By 2271, he was a full [[lieutenant]].  He obtained the rank of [[lieutenant commander]] during the second five-year voyage of the ''Enterprise'' and, in 2276, was promoted to [[commander]] and assigned as the executive officer of the USS ''Reliant''.  He appeared apparently as a retired commander in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', but later novels and fan sources from ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' indicate that he eventually became an admiral.  [[Walter Koenig]] also has been quoted as saying at science fiction conventions that he speculates often if Chekov is in some way related to [[Worf]]'s adoptive Russian parents.
*'''Physical Appearance of the Romulans''':  The ruling class Romulans of the 23rd century were referred to unofficially as Romulans of the "Smooth Brow".  These Romulans were direct descendants of the original Vulcan dissidents that left Vulcan circa AD&amp;nbsp;1 (Earth Calendar).  By the mid-24th century, the Smooth Brow Romulans had lost most of the power on Romulans to be replaced by standard Romulans who, through centuries of inbreeding and off-world marriages, had developed very pronounced forehead ridges.  These Romulans occupied most positions of power in the 24th century government and military; however, the Romulans of the Smooth Brow could still be found in the public light.  Commander Sela, a Romulan-Human cross, was often mistaken by fellow Romulans as a Smooth Brow.  Ambassador Spock was also able to infiltrate Romulan society by posing as a Smooth Brow Romulan.
*'''The Riker-Troi Romance Backstory''':  Although various hints have appeared in sundry ''Next Generation'' episodes, only the novel ''[[Imzadi]]'' actually told the whole story of how Riker and Troi originally met and fell in love - and of what came between them.
*'''Further Adventures of the ''Deep Space Nine'' crew''':  After the disappearance of [[Benjamin Sisko]] and the conclusion of the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], the planet [[Bajor]] joins the Federation.  [[Kira Nerys]] is given permanent command of the station and a [[Starfleet]] commission of [[captain]].  Many new crew members join DS9, including [[Elias Vaughn]] (the station's new [[executive officer]], and commander of the [[USS Defiant (NX-74205)|''Defiant'']]), [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] [[Thirishar ch'Thane]] (the new [[Andorian]] science officer), [[Lieutenant]] [[Sam Bowers (Star Trek)|Sam Bowers]] (tactical), and others.  Sisko eventually returns to corporeal existence and moves with his family to Bajor. (See [[Deep Space Nine relaunch]] for further information.)
* '''James T. Kirk's resurrection''':  Shortly after ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', William Shatner and co-writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens wrote a series of novels taking place after the events in the movie, bringing [[James T. Kirk]] back from the dead, much like mainstream comic books.  While the novels are not mentioned in regular continuity, they are often read by fans who felt Kirk had died an "unheroic" death and deserved something more.  Many fans accept these novels into their own [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] continuity (or at least choose to accept [[The Return (Shatner novel)|''The Return'']] only, the most important and commercially successful of the novels).  In these, Kirk is venturing in the 24th century, while falling in love again, having a child, getting along with [[Spock]], [[Leonard McCoy]] and, also temporally misplaced, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]], while also getting himself into new adventures with them, and developing a nice friendship with [[Jean Luc Picard]].  They even take a vacation trip together, in ''[[The Captain's Peril]]'', shortly after the Dominion War's end, a few months prior to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.  Critics cite an overdone focus on Kirk as the glorified hero, often leaving Picard and others in downplayed roles.  These novels, which are not considered part of the overall continuity of the other ''Star Trek'' novels, are collectively referred to by fans as the "Shatnerverse."&lt;br&gt;''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'', also uses the idea of Kirk living on in that both released episodes feature possible futures, The pilot "Come What May" features a scene where Kirk sees his possible future.  This includes most of the more famous movie scenes (Spock's death, and parts of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'') and then Spock speaking the works "Captain Kirk is alive" just ''after'' a repeat of Kirk's last line in ''Generations''.  In addition episode one ("In Harm's Way") features Kirk and Spock traveling back in time to help their younger selves; the year they come from is given as 2373, or two years after Kirk's "death" (and roughly the time period Shatner's third novel ''Avenger'' gives for Kirk's reappearance on the Galactic stage).
* '''Charles 'Trip' Tucker's life''':  In "[[These Are the Voyages... (Enterprise episode)|These Are The Voyages...]]", the final episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', [[Charles Tucker III|Charles 'Trip' Tucker]] is apparently killed defending his ship against alien pirates.  The latest ''Enterprise'' novel, ''Last Full Measure'', revealed in its final scenes that Trip actually survived the attack and lived on after the events of this episode.  It is unknown at present how Trip survived, who ordered that his death be faked, or why.  The ''Enterprise'' novels are currently undergoing a relaunch similar to that of ''DS9'', so it is possible that these questions may be answered.

==Disproved premises==
*'''Physical Appearance of the Klingons''':  The marked difference in the physical characteristics of the [[Klingon]]s, as seen in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and in later feature films and television productions, was first explained as the result of a genetic engineering experiment which took place approximately between the year 2210 and 2270.  In an attempt to emulate humans, and make infiltration in human regions of space easier, the [[Klingon Empire]] merged human [[DNA]] with a large segment of its military force.  The result was the "Klingon-Human Fusions" who were the only Klingons permitted to have contact with the Federation.  By 2271, this attempt at creating Klingon-Human Fusions had been abandoned and the Empire abolished the project.  Certain high ranking Klingons (such as [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]], [[Koloth]] and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]]) were permitted to undergo procedures to remove the human DNA from their cell structures and revert to a pure Klingon appearance.  To this day, the Klingon Empire considers the attempts at creating Klingon-Human Fusions to have been an embarrassment and it is "not discussed" with outsiders.  An alternate explanation was offered in the [[DC Comics]] [[graphic novel]], ''Debt of Honor'' which suggested the ridged Klingons were a different race than the human-like Klingons, which had suffered discommodation{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} at some point.  In a two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', aired in 2005 as "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]" and "[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", this premise was disproved and it was revealed that the change in Klingon appearance was the result of a virus that resulted from military enhancement experiments.  Presumably a cure was found for the condition (which was passed from generation to generation) sometime prior to ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''.  Dr. Antaak had one line toward the end of "[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]" stating that perhaps he could specialize in cosmetic surgery.  This would explain how Kor, Koloth and Kang changed their appearance from smooth brow in ''The Original Series'' to cranial ridges in ''DS9''.  (The DC Comics premise was disproved much earlier by the appearance of Kor, Koloth and Kang (now with ridges) in the ''DS9'' episode "Blood Oath").
*'''Klingon Society''':  [[FASA]] Corporation's 1980s ''Star Trek'' role-playing game and supplements greatly expanded on Klingon society, enlisting the aid of the late ''Star Trek'' novelist [[John M. Ford]].  The version of the Klingon society in the 2260s was that of a paranoid society of both "human-fusion" and "Imperial Klingons", complete with sophisticated nomenclatures, a Klingon Emperor, "thought admirals" and an afterlife known as the "Black Fleet."  The home planet was known as "Klinzhai".  Most of these ideas were superseded in several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (and subsequent productions) which established the Klingon homeworld as "Qo'nos" (also spelled "Kronos") and the Klingon afterlife as [[Stovokor]].  Flag ranks in the Klingon fleet have been established (post-FASA) as both [[general]]s (such as [[Martok]] from ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'') and [[admiral]]s (''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

==''The Animated Series''==
''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (''TAS'') was a 22 episode set of animated adventures of the ''Enterprise'' crew, which aired originally on [[NBC]] from 1973-1974. It featured the reappearance of popular characters from the original series, including [[Harry Mudd]] and [[Cyrano Jones]], and speculates on what happened to them after they were last seen in live-action. Some ''Star Trek'' novels and comics have utilized characters that were only ever seen in the animated series, most notably [[Arex]] and [[M'Ress]]. It has been suggested by fans that these stories took place during the fourth or fifth year of Kirk's original "five-year mission." Arguably, the most-debated element of ''TAS'' is the introduction of [[Robert April]] as the first captain of the ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701.

===Canon status===
From the show's debut up until the end of the first season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', ''TAS'' was considered part of ''Star Trek'' canon. Then, from the end of the first season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' on May 16, 1988 (when all licenses for [[Star Trek spin-off fiction|''Star Trek'' spin-off fiction]] were renegotiated) up to June 27, 2007, ''TAS'' was "decanonized". However, on June 27, 2007, ''Star Trek''{{'}}s official website incorporated information from ''TAS'' into its library, recanonizing it.

[[Image:Stradanus engraving.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|A 1948 reproduction printed from the Stradanus engraving.]]

The Stradanus engraving is a 1615 or 1621 (depending on the source) [[engraving]] that was used to print certificates of [[indulgences]] of forty days' remission of [[sins]] from [[Juan Pérez de la Serna]], then [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Mexico]].  The certificates were given to people who donated money to finance the construction of the new sanctuary of [[Tepeyac]], consecrated in 1622, which later became the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]].  Its actual title is ''[[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgen de Guadalupe]] con escenas de ocho [[Miracle|milagros]]'' ({{lang-es|Virgin of Guadalupe with scenes of eight miracles}}), but the term '''Stradanus engraving''' is used by Guadalupan researchers.  The plate was engraved by Samuel Stradanus of [[Antwerp]], who also provided engravings for the publication of [[Pedro de Moya]]'s 1622 ''Sanctum provinciale concilium mexici'' ({{lang-la|Holy council of the province of Mexico}}), the decrees of the 1585 Third Mexican Council. It is the first document to depict the [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and may have been a source of the ''Nican motecpana'', the portion of the ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'', an early source of the Guadalupan apparition, that relates the miracles associated with the icon.

'''Symphony No. 10''' is the tenth symphony by the American composer [[Philip Glass]].  The work was commissioned by the Orchestre Français des Jeunes and premiered August 9, 2012, with [[Dennis Russell Davies]] conducting the Orchestre Français des Jeunes at the Grand Théâtre de Provence in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Glass10" /&gt;  The piece had its [[United Kingdom]] premiere July 31, 2013 at [[The Proms]] in [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prom 25: Zappa – The Adventures of Greggery Peccary |work=[[BBC]] |date=2013 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/2010s/2013/july-31/14638 |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony reworks music originally written as ''Los paisajes del rio'' for the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]], premiered at the 2008 Expo Zaragoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Daniel Stephen |title=Philip Glass Blasts Past Beethoven with Fireworks of 10th Symphony |publisher=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=July 27, 2015 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/philip-glass-blasts-past-beethoven-fireworks-10th-symphony/ |accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the famed [[curse of the ninth]], Glass composed the piece before the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Glass)|Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web |last=Saer |first=Arabella |title=Glass's 10th Symphony, Grand Théâtre de Provence, Aix-en-Provence |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 12, 2012 |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c4127220-e2da-11e1-bf02-00144feab49a.html |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s (II doubled on [[E-flat clarinet]], III doubled on [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[Types of trombone#bass trombone|bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], six  [[Percussion instrument|percussionists]] ([[Tubular bells|chimes]], [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]]s, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[anvil]], [[gong|tamtam]], [[clash cymbals]], [[castanets]], [[wood block]], [[snare drum]], [[tenor drum]], [[bass drum]]), [[celesta]], [[piano]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Glass10" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere at the Grand Théâtre de Provence, Arabella Saer of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' lauded the symphony, writing:{{quote|There were enough typical Glass elements – repeated arpeggios, chugging chords, cross-rhythms and pared-down harmony – for the 35-minute piece to win no new converts. But there was also a cool, fresh energy about it, arising as much, perhaps, from the ''jeunesse'' of the players and the sleek, modern hall (only five years old), as from the fact that Glass must have had a youth orchestra – ''this'' youth orchestra – in mind when he wrote it.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;}}
Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' later opined, "Its extrovert origins as latter-day fireworks music remain clear, though, as Glass's orchestration, with its brassy edge and martial percussion – lots of snare drum – underlines in Davies's performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clements |first=Andrew |title=Glass: Symphony No 10; Concert Overture CD review – an extrovert celebration |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/glass-symphony-no-10-concert-overture-cd-review |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pwyll ap Siôn of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' also gave the work moderate praise, writing:{{quote|The work opens and ends effectively enough with a darkly exuberant first and flamboyant fifth. Deprived of their extra-musical clothing, some of the other movements lack variety and substance, however. The slow second's gradually unfolding two-note melody is only enlivened by pulsing patterns in percussion and brass, while the third’s endless tonic-dominant oscillations and the fourth’s paradiddle patterns struggle to hold interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siôn |first=Pwyll ap |title=GLASS Symphony No 10.

'''''Tales of Zorro''''' is a 2008 [[anthology]] of Zorro stories and is the first collection of original short fiction featuring [[pulp hero]] [[Zorro]], edited by [[Richard Dean Starr]] and published by [[Moonstone Books]] in 2008.  A second [[anthology]], ''[[More Tales of Zorro]]'', was published in 2011.

==Book Notes==

The stories in ''Tales of Zorro'' incorporate elements from the original Zorro incarnation by [[Johnston McCulley]] in ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]''. It also contains many references to other versions of Zorro including the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'', Walt Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]), and the [[Zorro (1990 TV series)|New World Television series]], as well as [[Isabel Allende]]'s ''[[Zorro: A Novel]]'', among others.

Some stories, such as Peter David's "Colors Seen by Candlelight" incorporate famous historical figures into the story while others contain suggestions of the supernatural or are told from unconventional viewpoints, such as [[A. C. Crispin]] and [[Kathleen O'Malley]]'s story, "Tornado Warning", which is told through the eyes of Zorro's famous [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] stallion, [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].

The collection also includes a young adult story, "The Feathered Cape" by [[Jan Adkins]], author of ''Young Zorro: The Iron Brand''.  Adkins is a young adult author and illustrator who was also a technical advisor for Allende's 2005 ''[[Zorro (novel)|Zorro]]''.

Richard Dean Starr contributed a story to the book, "Winds of Change" and also collaborated on [[Max Allan Collins]]' story, "Zorro and the Fate Worse Than Death".

''Tales of Zorro'' contains three important essays including a [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] by [[Guy Williams, Jr.]] (with [[Matthew Baugh]]), a [[foreword]] by [[Zorro Productions, Inc.]] Senior Vice-President [[Sandra Curtis]], and an [[Afterword]] by [[Isabel Allende]].

'''''Thank You, Fog: last poems by W. H. Auden''''' is a posthumous book of poems by [[W. H. Auden]], published in 1974.

The book contains poems written mostly in 1972 and 1973; after Auden's death in September 1973 it was prepared for publication by his [[literary executor]] [[Edward Mendelson]], who also included an "antimasque" titled "The Entertainment of the Senses", written in 1973 by Auden and [[Chester Kallman]] as an interpolation in a planned production of [[James Shirley]]'s masque ''Cupid and Death'' (1653); the antimasque was commissioned by the composer [[John Gardner (composer)|John Gardner]].

The shorter poems in the book, in addition to the title poem, include "Aubade", "Unpredictable but Providential", "Address to the Beasts", "Archaeology", "No, Plato, No", "Nocturne", "A Thanksgiving", and "Lullaby" ("The din of work is subdued"; titled in other editions with a title found in Auden's typescripts, "A Lullaby", which distinguishes it from a different earlier poem titled "Lullaby"). The book also includes two of the lyrics that Auden wrote for the musical comedy [[Man of La Mancha]], which were rejected by the original librettist of that play.

'''''The Duel After the Masquerade''''' is a painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], currently housed in the [[Musée Condé]] in [[Château de Chantilly|Chantilly]], France.

==History==
In 1859, [[William Thompson Walters]] purchased ''The Duel After the Masquerade'' at the National Academy of Design in New York for $2,500.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|17}} The painting is a replica by Gérôme of his 1857 work ''Suite d'un bal masqué'', painted for the duc d'Aumale. The original is part of the collection of the [[Musée Condé]] in [[Château de Chantilly|Chantilly]], France.&lt;ref name="Musée Condé"/&gt; It was not unusual for artists to replicate their own paintings and other versions had also been painted for [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Prince Alexander]] of Russia and for the [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha|Ali Pacha]].  Walters asked the manager of the exhibition at the National Academy of Design for a letter of authentication from Gérôme and a comparison of the work he had purchased to the original.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|241}}

The original became famous almost overnight with the critics of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] speculating about Gerome's sources for the incident depicted in the painting.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt; In a poll taken in the winter of 1909–1910, Baltimoreans were asked to identify their fifty-five favorite works of art and  ''The Duel After the Masquerade'' topped the list.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|183}}

==Composition==
The scene is set on a gray winter morning in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], trees bare and snow covering the ground.  A man dressed as a [[Pierrot]] has been mortally wounded in a duel and has collapsed into the arms of a [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duc de Guise]].  A surgeon, dressed as a [[doge of Venice]], tries to stop the flow of blood, while a [[Domino costume|Domino]] clutches his own head.

The survivor of the duel, dressed as an [[Native Americans in popular culture|American Indian]], walks away with his second, [[Harlequin]], leaving behind his weapon and some feathers of his [[War bonnet|headdress]], towards his carriage, shown waiting in the background.

The bizarreness of the scene in regard to the brightly colored costumes turns to pathos at the sight of blood on the Pierrot.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Golden Key''''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[George MacDonald]].  It was published in ''Dealings with the Fairies'' (1867).

It is particularly noted for the intensity of the suggestive imagery, which implies a spiritual meaning to the story without providing a transparent allegory for the events in it.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p nope168-9 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
A young boy listens to his Great-aunt's stories about a magical golden key found at the end of a rainbow.  One day, he sees an immense rainbow and sets out to find its end in an [[Enchanted forest|enchanted forest]]. As the forest is in [[Fairy]]land where everything has an opposite effect, the rainbow only glows brighter when the sun sets. He finds the key, then it dawns on him that he does not know where the lock is.

In the same village on the border of this forest, a merchant's neglected daughter is frightened by the [[Fairy|fairies]].  Their first attempt fails but when they make her think [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|the three bears]] are coming into her bedroom, she flees into the woods.

A tree tries to trap her, but a feathered airborne fish frees her, then leads her to a wise woman's cottage. A pot is boiling there, and the air fish flies into it.  The lady asks her name; the girl says that the servants always called her Tangle, and the lady decides that although her tangled hair was their fault for not looking after her, Tangle is a pretty name.  She says she is called Grandmother, and that it has been three years since Tangle ran away from the "bears".  She has the girl washed by fish and dresses her. Then they eat the air fish for dinner after the lady assures her that the air fish had voluntarily gone into the pot to be their food, and the cooking pot produces a little-winged figure, who flies off.

The lady sends another air fish after the young man at the foot of the rainbow.  At supper the next day, the young man, Mossy, arrives.  The lady tells Mossy that if he searches for the keyhole, he will find it, and sends Tangle with him. In their wanderings, they come across a valley where beautiful shadows fill the air, where they stay, grow old, and then resolve to find the land the marvelous shadows fall from; but they become separated so they each continue their journey alone.

Tangle meets with the winged [[Aeranthes|aëranth]] (air-flower) that used to be the fish, who leads her to the mountain. There she meets the [[Old Man of the Sea]].  He can not tell her the way to the land from which the shadows fall and send her to his brother the Old Man of the Earth.  He also does not know and sends her to the Old Man of the Fire.

: Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the cave, raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning. It disclosed a great hole that went [[Vertical direction|plumb-down]].
:"That is the way," he said.
:"But there are no stairs."
:"You must throw yourself in. There is no other way."

She throws herself in and at the end of the hole, finds the Old Man of the Fire. This Old Man turns out to be youngest of all, a wise child arranging colored spheres in a significant way. After giving her protection from the fiery path, he sends her out following a snake, which will lead her to that land.

Mossy also finds the Man of the Sea, rightly recognizing him as death, and he gains the power to walk across the sea. After climbing a precipice, he enters a chamber where the colors of the rainbow appear as columns of light.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlocking Wonder in 'The Golden Key'", Ruth Sanderson [http://www.worksofmacdonald.com/ruth-sanderson-unlocking-wonder/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Tangle is waiting for him. She shows him another door that his key unlocks, opening onto a glowing stairway to the land they were searching for, from which the shadows fall.  As they start to climb, the story ends.

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] of disputed authorship, either by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], his workshop, or a collaboration between artist and workshop. It was created after 1486.

The triptych currently resides at the [[Groeningemuseum]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. The outside of the shutters are painted in [[grisaille]], while the inside shutters and center are oil on panel.

==History==
The work belonged to E. Gravet's collection, and then to that of Seligman, in [[Paris]]. In 1907 it was acquired by  A. Bernaert, who donated it to the city of Bruges. In 1936 it was cleaned and was restored again in 1959. In that occasion, the [[grisaille]] painting of the external shutters were discovered, although damaged. The painting above the internal frames is lost.

The attribution of the work is dubious, due to its mediocre quality.  [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronologic]] analysis dated it from not before 1486.&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004 |isbn=978-88-572-0615-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting's composition has similarities to [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|''The Last Judgment'' triptych]] in Vienna and the ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': both show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right.

Like in other contemporary [[Flemish art|Flemish]] triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in [[grisaille]] with an ''Coronation with Thorns''.

In the central panel is Christ as a judge within a celestial sphere, flanked by angels who are playing the Trumpets of Last Judgement, and by the apostles. Below him is the punishment of sinners which, like the ''Last Judgement'' of Vienna, continues in the Hell depiction at right. At left is the Paradise, where the blessed souls are being shipped to Eden on a boat with a pink tent. The tower is a symbol of the Fountain of Eternal Youth, a more articulate version of which appears in the ''Garden of Delights''.

The central panel is mostly occupied by insect-like demons who torture the men, punishments including burning, eating impure food (the gluttonous) etc., all inspired by [[Netherlandish Proverbs]]. The infernal city at right is under siege by demons, while a fire is visible in  the far background.

The '''Treasury Relief Art Project''' was a [[New Deal]] arts program that commissioned visual artists to provide artistic decoration for existing Federal buildings during the [[Great Depression in the United States]]. A project of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], TRAP was administered by the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] and funded by the [[Works Progress Administration]], which provided assistants employed through the [[Federal Art Project]]. The Treasury Relief Art Project also created murals and sculpture for [[Public Works Administration]] housing projects. TRAP was established July 21, 1935, and continued through June 30, 1938.

==Program==
[[File:Marsh-Hudson-Ambrose-Block-Custom-House.jpg|left|thumb|Murals in fresco by Reginald Marsh for the rotunda of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (1937)]]
The Treasury Relief Art Project was created July 21, 1935,&lt;ref name="NARA TRAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://research.archives.gov/id/532328 |title=Treasury Relief Art Project, 1935–1939 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=National Archives Catalog |access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an allocation of $530,784 from the Works Progress Administration. The project was conceived and overseen by Treasury Department arts administrator [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]]. Artist [[Olin Dows]] was chief of the Treasury Relief Art Project;&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalfatovic |first=Martin R. |date=1994 |title=The New Deal Fine Arts Projects: A Bibliography, 1933–1992 |url=https://archive.org/stream/newdealfineartsp00kalf#page/n4/mode/1up |location=Metuchen, New Jersey |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2749-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|xxiv–xxx}} Cecil H. Jones, who later succeeded Dows, was assistant chief. Forbes Watson was director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/treasury-relief-art-project-selected-administrative-and-business-records-9773 |title=Treasury Relief Art Project selected administrative and business records, 1935–1939|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Archives of American Art |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the concurrent Treasury [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], TRAP was a work-relief program, subject to the income and employment standards of the WPA.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxix}} The September 1935 announcement of the program estimated that it would employ 400 to 500 artists.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} 

The principal mission of the Treasury Relief Art Project was to provide artistic decoration for existing Federal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101384 |title=New Deal Artwork: GSA's Inventory Project |website= |publisher=[[General Services Administration]] |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects could not be performed by the Section of Painting and Sculpture,&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;{{Rp|62}} which commissioned art for new construction using a percentage of the budget overseen by the Treasury Department's procurement division.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxvi–xxvii}} The Treasury Relief Art Project was funded by the WPA. The Section supervised the creative output of TRAP, and selected a master artist for each project. Assistants were then chosen by the artist from the rolls of the WPA [[Federal Art Project]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Francis V. |date=Autumn 1969 |title=The New Deal Art Projects in New York  |journal=The American Art Journal |publisher=Kennedy Galleries, Inc. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=58–79 |jstor=1593876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|62–63}}

As chief of the Treasury Relief Art Project, Dows was responsible for maintaining financial records for relief and non-relief personnel. A fixed proportion of all workers was to be taken from the relief rolls—initially 90 percent,&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxxii}} but revised to 75 percent in December 1935.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|47}}

Although it was regarded as a success, the Treasury Relief Art Project was ended June 30, 1938.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxx}}

In addition to producing artwork for Federal buildings, the Treasury Relief Art Project created murals and sculpture for [[Public Works Administration]] housing projects in Boston, Camden, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxx}} and Stamford.&lt;ref name="Fairfield Court"/&gt;

==Artists==
To maintain its high artistic standards, the Treasury Relief Art Project commissioned only a small number of artists—356 workers at its peak&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|xxiv}} in 1936. [[Richmond Barthé]], Ahron Ben-Shmuel, [[Paul Cadmus]], [[Marion Greenwood]], [[William Gropper]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]] and [[Heinz Warneke]] were among the master artists who led projects.&lt;ref name="NARA TRAP"/&gt; A complete list of projects and artists employed by TRAP is included in the final report held by the Smithsonian's [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"/&gt;{{Rp|185}}

'''Turtleback''' or '''Turtle-back tombs''' or '''turtle shell tombs''' ({{zh|s=龟壳墓|t=龜殼墓|p=guī ké mù|poj=ku-khak-bōng}}; {{lang-ja|亀甲墓}}, ''kamekōbaka'') are a particular type of [[tomb]]s commonly found in some coastal areas of China's [[Fujian]] Province, and in Japan's [[Ryūkyū]] Islands.

In the Chinese version, the tomb itself is made to look like the [[carapace]] of a [[tortoise]]; the vertical tombstone with the name of the deceased is put where the tortoise would have had its head, at the end of the grave where the feet of the buried body are.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt; The tomb is surrounded by an [[Omega|Ω]]-shaped ridge, with its opening on the side where the tortoise's head would have been and where the tombstone is.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;

The Ryūkyūan version has the same overall shape and layout, but on a much greater scale. The body of the "tortoise" serves as a family [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]].&lt;ref name=kabira/&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Kinmen - turtleback tomb - DSCF9723.JPG|thumb|A typical turtle-back tomb in [[Kinmen]] Island off Fujian coast]]
According to [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot|J.J.M. de Groot]], the main purpose of the horseshoe-shaped, or, more frequently, Ω-shaped ridge surrounding the tomb is to substitute for a range of hills ridge which, according to the principles of [[feng shui]], needs to protect the grave from the "noxious winds" from the three sides – the situation that is rarely naturally obtainable.&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

|url=https://archive.org/details/religioussystemo03groo |pages=941–942
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tumulus over the tomb naturally has somewhat turtle-like shape, considering the large size of a traditional Chinese [[coffin]], [[:File:Macau-coffin-shop-0805.jpg|its shape]], and the shallowness of the grave.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;&lt;ref name=deGroot941/&gt; However, the tumulus is often actually covered with plaster (or, these days, concrete), decorated in such a way as to remind one of the pattern seen on a tortoise shell.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;

It is commonly said that the tomb imitates the shape of a tortoise due to those animals' longevity, thus promising long life to the descendants of the deceased.&lt;ref name=deGroot1082/&gt;
It has been suggested (among others, by J.J.M. de Groot) that the custom of building turtle-shaped tombs may also have to do with the desire to place the grave under the influence of the heavenly warrior Xuanwu, whose symbol is the [[Black Tortoise]].&lt;ref name=deGroot1082&gt;{{harvnb|de Groot|1892|pp=1082–1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.sinchew.com.my/node/152069|title= 各籍貫墳墓造型 (In every land, its own kind of graves)

A legend has been recorded which ascribes to tortoises the ability to find an auspicious place for a burial. According to the legend, some time during the [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song|Xiangfu era]], a man in [[Guangdong]] who was looking for a suitable (in [[feng shui]] terms) place to bury one of his parents on a certain mountain learned that ten days prior several dozens of tortoises had brought a large dead tortoise to a certain spot and buried him there. The man found the tortoise's grave, reburied the reptile elsewhere, and used the spot to bury his own parent. Accordingly, he then had three sons born to him, two of whom earned the ''[[Imperial examinations|jinshi]]'' degrees, and all three were to occupy high positions in the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] establishment.&lt;ref name=deGroot980&gt;{{harvnb|de Groot|1892|pp=980–981}}。 De Groot quotes and translates the legend from [[:zh:s:補筆談|補筆談]] ("Additions to the Pencil Gossip"), Chapter (''quan'') 3. The location mentioned in the legend, Liangzhou ([[:zh:廉州|廉州]]) is near today's [[Beihai]], [[Guangxi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering the turtle motif in tomb constructions, some authors link it with the general symbolism of a turtle in the ancient Chinese culture, with its flat [[plastron]] below and its domed [[carapace]] above, representing the shape of the universe.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{citation

however, unlike Fujian's turtle-back shaped tombs, ''bixi'' turtles are not placed directly above the grave. (And, unlike ''bixi''s, turtle-back graves don't have tablets standing on top of them).

When discussing the connection between the turtle/tortoise symbolism and burial practices, some authors even mention the custom of eating a variety of the traditional sweets, the [[Red Tortoise Cake#Qing Ming Festival|red turtle cakes]], at funeral feasts.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

==In the Ryūkyū Islands==
[[File:Okinawa turtle back tomb.JPG|thumb|A turtle-back tomb in [[Okinawa]]]]
[[File:Tomb of gosamaru.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Gosamaru]]
The turtle-back tombs are thought to have been introduced into the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] from Fujian in the late 17th or early 18th century ("in the interval between the careers of [[Shō Shōken]] and [[Sai On]]", according to [[Gregory Smits]]' monograph on the intellectual history of the Ryūkyū Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors give earlier dates; in particular, the tomb of [[Gosamaru]] (d. 1458) is often described as the first Ryūkyūan turtle-back tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Bridgeway Press |year=1959|title=Customs and culture of Okinawa
|editor=Gladys Zabilka|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OmAbAAAAIAAJ|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okinawabbhi.com/spotinfo/index.php?itemid=124 Gosamaru's tomb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307075138/http://www.okinawabbhi.com/spotinfo/index.php?itemid=124 |date=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Okinawans believe that the shape of the tombs represent a woman's [[Uterus|womb]], so that the dead "return to the source".&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo: A Study of Okinawan Village Life''. University of California Press, Berkley, 1955. Page 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the mid-20th century, the turtleback tomb became the predominant tomb style in some parts of the Ryūkyū Islands. E.g., this was reported in [[Kabira, Okinawa|Kabira]] Village (near [[Kabira Bay]]) in [[Ishigaki Island]]. Unlike single-person turtleback tombs of Fujian, the turtleback tombs of Ryūkyū were more of a [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]], where bones of many generations of a particular family could repose. Typically, the coffin with the body of a deceased member of the family would stay in one part of such a tomb for some years (3, 5, 7, or 9). After the body would have decomposed, the [[Excarnation|bones would be washed]] by young female relatives of the deceased, placed into a large [[earthenware]] jar,  and stored elsewhere in the tomb.&lt;ref name=kabira&gt;{{citation|title=The Culture of Kabira, Southern Ryūkyū Islands|author= Allan H. Smith|journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=104|issue=2 |date=Apr 19, 1960|pages=134–171 |JSTOR=985656}} (pp. 170–171).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a fictionalized description of a turtleback tomb in the eponymous novel by [[Tatsuhiro Oshiro]] (where much of the action happens inside such a tomb), the tomb's floor space is 150 square feet.&lt;ref name=oshiro&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inside the tomb, urns with the bones of deceased ancestors stand on multiple rows of stone shelves, in the order of seniority. The doorway of the tomb is closed with a massive stone, serving as a door.&lt;ref name=oshiro/&gt;

In the spring of 1945, during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], many Okinawan civilians sought refuge from the naval bombardment of the island inside their ancestors' turtle-back tombs,&lt;ref name=mm/&gt;&lt;ref name=steiner&gt;{{citation|title=Okinawa and Its People—II|author=Paul E. Steiner|journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume= 64|issue= 4|date=Apr 1947|pages= 306–312 |JSTOR=19369}} (p. 311)&lt;/ref&gt; just like the characters of Oshiro's short novel.&lt;ref name=oshiro/&gt;
Later, many of these tombs were also used by the Japanese defenders of the islands.&lt;ref name=steiner/&gt;
The image became iconic enough for a local novelist, [[Tatsuhiro Oshiro]], to name a novel after these turtle-back tombs. (''Kame kōbaka'', 1966).&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{citation

'''Vincent Callebaut''' (b. May 27, 1977 - ) is a Belgian ecological [[architect]]. He designs futuristic-like [[ecodistrict]] projects which take account of several aspects of sustainability (renewable energies, biodiversity, urban agriculture).

==Biography==

Vincent Callebaut was born in 1977 in Belgium. He graduated in 2000 from the Institute [[Victor Horta]], he moved to Paris to intern with architects [[Odile Decq]] and [[Massimiliano Fuksas]] and then founded his own company, « ''Vincent Callebaut Architectures'' ».

==Virtual projects==

===Dragonfly===

The project consists on implementing "[[Vertical farming|vertical farms]]" in [[Manhattan]] along the East River at the South edge of the Roosevelt Island. In a way to rethink the city's food production and encourage each inhabitant to participate to the gardens, one of the visions of the Dragonfly project was defined as: 'Eating an apple just picked out of a collective orchard in the fourth floor while looking at New York through the window and then go back to your office just in the upper floor.'&lt;ref name="culturebox"&gt;{{cite web|title=culturebox|url=http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/tendances/architecture/architecte-visionnaire-vincent-callebaut-invente-la-ville-de-demain-148595|website=culturebox.francetvinfo.fr|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was inspired by the Japanese movie "[[Castle in the Sky|Laputa : Castle in the sky]]".&lt;ref name="FranceAmerique"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/07/31/dragonfly_une_ferme_dans_un_gratte-ciel.html|website=france-amerique.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragonfly building is {{convert|575|m}} high, shaped as firefly wings. It is composed of two towers related by a 'bio-climatic' glasshouse.  It deploys itself between two crystalline wings made out of glass and steel. The structure in honeycomb stitch allows the sunlight to pass through the building.&lt;ref name="urbanism" /&gt; This concept is seen as a feeder farm and reconnects the consumers with producers. This prototype of urban farm would have superimposed 132 floors and estending {{convert|600|m}} vertically with garden vegetables, fields, production of meat, milk, poultry and eggs where people could grow their own food. The Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production. It is self-sufficient in energy, water and bio-fertilizing, powered by sunshield and eolian systems. These combine solar and wind power, which would make the Dragonfly self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="inhabitat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhabitat|url=http://inhabitat.com/dragonfly-urban-agriculture-concept-for-ny/|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Everything is recyclable in a continuous auto-feeding so that nothing is lost.  The spaces between the wings are designed to take advantage of solar energy by accumulating warm air in the structure during winter. During the summer it is cooling which is facilitated through natural ventilation and "evapo-perspiration" from the plants.&lt;ref name="inhabitat" /&gt;

The objectives of the Dragonfly project were defined as:
*Creating a proximity between the inhabitants and their productions.
*Reducing intermediaries in the production mode.
*Getting close to self-sufficiency which leads to financial savings.&lt;ref name="urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragonfly|url=http://projets-architecte-urbanisme.fr/projet-dragonfly-de-vincent-callebaut-ferme-verticale-dans-new-york/|website=Architecture Urbanisme|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lilypad===
{{Main| Floating ecopolis}}
The Lilypad or [[Floating ecopolis]] project is based on the idea of creating a place for future refugees of [[Current sea level rise]] caused by [[Global warming]].

=== Tao Zhu Yin Yuan ===

Formerly called "Agora Garden", Vincent Callebaut designed a tower for [[Taipei]], promoting vertical construction in an overpopulated city.&lt;ref name=FranceInter&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept of eco-construction to reduce the carbon footprint of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Dezeen&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent Callebaut Architectures SARL replied to an invitation to tender in November 2010. As of 2014 the project is under construction, and due for completion in 2016.&lt;ref name=culturebox/&gt;

The shape of the building looks like a molecule of [[DNA]] with its [[double helix]] (but in opposite [[chirality]] of most common (known) B-form DNA). This was designed to represent a symbol of life and [[wikt:dynamism|dynamism]].&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; The surface area is about {{convert|50000|m²}}.

The aim of the project is to represent a perfect [[symbiosis]] between humans and nature. Vincent Callebaut aims to develop an avant-gardist architecture and tries to institute a new life style in harmony with nature. The building is intended to guarantee environmental norms in order to obtain the Green Building Label delivered by the Home Affairs Ministry of Taipei.

The project addresses four ecologic objectives of the [[Copenhagen Accord]]:&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

* Reduction of [[global warming]]
* Protection of biodiversity.
* Protection of the environment and quality of life
* Management natural resources and waste

The Agora Garden concept embraces the [[Cradle to Cradle]] philosophy: "nothing is lost and everything transforms itself" ([[Antoine Lavoisier]]). All materials are recycled or recyclable in order to imitate the processes of natural ecosystems. For example, at the top there is a huge free access garden covered by photovoltaic panels which produce electricity for the building. The tower is surrounding by {{convert|20|m|adj=on}} trees which increase the biodiversity in the city.&lt;ref name=Dezeen/&gt;

Agora Garden was planned as twenty levels in a double helix formation, with a total twist from bottom to top of ninety degrees. The twist satisfies four major objectives. Firstly, thanks to this architecture, the morphology of the building changes according to its orientation: On the East/West side we can see a rhomboidal pyramid, when one the North/South side we can see a reverse pyramid. Then, all flats have their own balconies looking like a [[hanging garden]]. Thirdly, there is no vis-à-vis so inhabitants have privacy and a panoramic view on Taipei.&lt;ref name=FranceInter/&gt; &lt;!-- And number four has gone missing? --&gt;

The six main components of the project are :
* The forestair{{clarify|date=November 2017}}: the building is bordered by a forest which ensures the privacy of the inhabitants. The light is over present{{clarify|date=November 2017}} and the car parks, the swimming pool and the fitness area are naturally ventilated.
* Indoor and outdoor areas are well connected thanks to all the bay windows.
* The central core is composed of two staircases, four high speed elevators, a car elevator and two sky garages.
* The apartments measure {{convert|650|m2}}. This could seem large for European people but in Taiwan it is not uncommon for large families of three generations to live together in one flat.
* The landscapes balconies project is to build gardens which cover the entire building and in this way reeintroduce an element of nature to the city. Inhabitants can cultivate fruits, vegetables and herbs so that they could be self-sufficient. Therefore, this gardens take part of the sustainability process. There are compost spaces to transform waste into organic fertilizers, and reservoirs to collect rainwater.
* At a height of {{convert|100|m}}, a {{convert|1000|m²}} [[pergola]] with photovoltaic covering generates electricity for the network of the building.

===The Gate===

The Gate is under construction in Cairo (Egypt). It is a multi-use complex with housing, work spaces and facilities like sports. The roof top is a garden where you can swim or run.

In traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:侘|侘]][[wikt:寂|寂]]|'''wabi-sabi'''}} is a [[world view]] centered on the acceptance of [[wikt:transience|transience]] and imperfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm|title=What Is Wabi-Sabi?|website=nobleharbor.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; It is a concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}} and {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}.

Characteristics of the ''wabi-sabi'' aesthetic include [[asymmetry]], roughness, [[simplicity]], economy, austerity, modesty, [[intimacy]], and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

==Description==
According to [[Leonard Koren]], ''wabi-sabi'' can be defined as "the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] of aesthetic values as do the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideals of [[beauty]] and perfection in the far West."&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; Whereas  Andrew Juniper notes that "If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."&lt;ref name=Juniper&gt;{{cite book |last=Juniper |first=Andrew |title=Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-8048-3482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Richard Powell, "Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Richard R. | title=Wabi Sabi Simple | publisher=Adams Media | year=2004 | isbn=1-59337-178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' do not translate easily. ''Wabi'' originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; ''sabi'' meant "chill", "lean" or "withered". Around the 14th century these meanings began to change, taking on more positive connotations.&lt;ref name=Koren&gt;{{cite book |last=Koren |first=Leonard |title=Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-880656-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wabi'' now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. It can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. ''Sabi'' is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its [[patina]] and wear, or in any visible repairs.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, wabi-sabi eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' shifted to become more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to [[satori]], or enlightenment. In today's Japan, the meaning of wabi-sabi is often condensed to "wisdom in natural simplicity". In art books, it is typically defined as "flawed beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an engineering or design point of view, ''wabi'' may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; then ''sabi'' could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word sabi, {{nihongo|to rust|錆||also pronounced ''sabi''}}. Although the [[kanji]] characters for "rust" is not the same {{nihongo||寂|sabi}} in ''wabi-sabi'', the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'') is believed to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;錆びをめぐる話題, 井上勝也, 裳華房, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.memenet.or.jp/kinugawa/sabi/00121.htm さびの文字] on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Contemporary wabi-sabi tea bowl.jpg|left|thumb|Modern tea vessel made in the ''wabi-sabi'' style]]
A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], the pottery items used are often rustic and simple-looking, e.g. [[Hagi ware]], with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of wabi-sabi aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them (''sabi'') and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (''wabi''), which serves as a kind of signature of the ''Hagi-yaki'' style.

''Wabi'' and ''sabi'' both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting wabi-sabi on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brown, Simon | title=Practical Wabi Sabi | publisher=Carroll &amp; Brown |year=2007 | isbn=1-904760-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that wabi-sabi describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense wabi-sabi is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions.

In one sense wabi-sabi is a training whereby the student of wabi-sabi learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. Wabi-sabi can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the [[syncretic]] nature of Japanese belief.

==In Japanese arts==
Many [[Japanese art]]s over the past thousand years have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Mahayana]] philosophy, particularly acceptance and contemplation of the imperfection, constant [[flux]] and [[impermanence]] of all things. Such arts can exemplify a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Examples include:
* [[Honkyoku]] (traditional [[shakuhachi]] music of wandering Zen monks)
* [[Ikebana]] (flower arrangement)
* [[Bonsai]] design features such as snags, deadwood and hollow trunks highlight passage of time and natural cycles. Bonsai are often displayed in fall color or after they have shed leaves seasonally, to admire their bare branches.
* [[Japanese garden]]s, [[Zen garden]]s  (tray gardens)
* [[Japanese poetry]]
* [[Japanese pottery]], [[Hagi ware]], [[Raku ware]]
* [[Japanese tea ceremony]]

A contemporary Japanese appraisal of this concept is found in the influential essay ''[[In Praise of Shadows]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Western use==
Designer [[Leonard Koren]] (born 1948) in 1994 published ''Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers''&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; as an examination of wabi-sabi, contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently "became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes."&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=An Idiosyncratic Designer, a Serene New Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/garden/23leonard.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics  and techniques and founded an influential European aesthetic movement which also included Dame [[Lucy Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Some [[haiku in English]] adapt the wabi-sabi aesthetic, with spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} such as [[Nick Virgilio]]'s "autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cor van den Heuvel]], editor. ''The Haiku Anthology''. Fireside, 1986. {{ISBN|0671628372}} p285&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of American artist [[John Connell]] (born 1940) is  centered on the idea of wabi.&lt;ref&gt;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Stuckist]] artist and [[remodernist film]]maker [[Jesse Richards]] (born 1975) employs it in nearly all of his work, along with [[mono no aware]].

During the 1990s the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in [[Agile programming]] and [[Wiki]] to describe acceptance of the state of ongoing imperfection that is the product of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2009, [[Marcel Theroux]] presented "In Search of Wabi Sabi" on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's ''Hidden Japan'' season of programming. Theroux traveled throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people, beginning by comically enacting a challenge from the book ''Living Wabi Sabi'' by [[Taro Gold]] to "ask people on a Tokyo street to describe Wabi Sabi." Theroux showed that, just as Gold predicted, "they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable." &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Dorsey]], the billionaire founder of [[Twitter]] and [[Square, Inc.|Square]], promotes the Wabi-sabi philosophy of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Yung Chang''' (born 1977) is a [[Chinese Canadian]] [[film director]] and was part of the collective member directors of Canadian film production firm [[EyeSteelFilm]].

==Biography==
Chang, made his first feature documentary, ''[[Up the Yangtze]]''  in 2007. The film used China's highly contested [[Three Gorges Dam]] as a dramatic backdrop for a moving and richly detailed narrative of a peasant family negotiating unprecedented historic changes. ''Up the Yangtze'' played at numerous festivals, including Sundance, and was one of the top-grossing documentary box office releases in 2008. ''[[China Heavyweight]]'', Chang's sophomore film, is about a boxing coach and his two students in rural China fighting to become amateur and professional champions. The film had its premiere at Sundance 2012 in the World Documentary competition. It is distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]]. In the same year, Chang also completed ''[[The Fruit Hunters]]'', a feature documentary about nature, commerce and obsession in the fruit underworld. The film is distributed by [[Cinedigm New Video]]. Chang is writing ''Eggplant 《茄子》'', his first feature fiction film,  about a Chinese wedding photographer. The project was selected to participate in the prestigious [[Sundance Institute]] Director and Screenwriters labs in 2015. He is in pre-production for a feature documentary about [[Robert Fisk]], the controversial Middle East correspondent co-produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. His latest film, Gatekeeper, is on the festival circuit and streaming on Field of Vision, [[Laura Poitras]]' curated online film unit.
